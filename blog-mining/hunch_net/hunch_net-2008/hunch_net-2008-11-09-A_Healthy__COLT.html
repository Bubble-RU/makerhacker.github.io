<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers fromICML 2008that I found interesting.Risi
KondorandKarsten Borgwardt,The Skew Spectrum of Graphs. This paper is about a
new family of functions on graphs which is invariant under node label
permutation. They show that these quantities appear to yield good features for
learning.Sanjoy DasguptaandDaniel Hsu.Hierarchical sampling for active
learning.This is the first published practical consistent active learning
algorithm. The abstract is also pretty impressive.Lihong Li,Michael Littman,
andThomas WalshKnows What It Knows: A Framework For Self-Aware Learning.This
is an attempt to create learning algorithms that know when they err, (other
work includesVovk). It's not yet clear to me what the right model forfeature-
dependent confidence intervalsis.Novi Quadrianto,Alex Smola,TIberio Caetano,
andQuoc Viet LeEstimating Labels from Label Proportions. This is an example of
learning in a specialization of the offline contextual bandit setting.Filip

choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that

<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I've been the treasurer of the Association for
Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over fromJohn
Casebefore me. A transfer of duties toPhil Longis now about complete. This
probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for
those interested.The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over
reviewing decisions atCOLT 2009, one as an author and several as a member of
the program committee. I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is
important work, partly because I'm focused on learning theory with practical
implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is
typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from
insider-clique issues. The degree to which these issues come up varies
substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one. And, it's
important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly
so bad asthey were. Never</p><p>5 0.57273155 <a title="324-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Apparently, the companySpockis setting up a$50k entity resolution challenge.
$50k is much less than the Netflix challenge, but it's effectively the same as
Netflix untilsomeone reaches 10%. It's also nice that the Spock challenge has
a short duration. The (visible) test set is of size 25k and the training set
has size 75k.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.80387402 <a title="324-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-09-A_Healthy__COLT.html">324 hunch net-2008-11-09-A Healthy  COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Awhile ago, we discussed the health ofCOLT.COLT 2008substantially addressed my
concerns. The papers were diverse and several were interesting. Attendance was
up, which is particularly notable in Europe. In my opinion, the colocation
with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.And, perhaps best of all,
registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from
theAcademy of Finland,Google,IBM, andYahoo.A basic question is: what went
right? There seem to be several answers.Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants
to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university
substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel.Organization-wise, the
Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up. Having
too many volunteers is a good failure mode.Organization-wise, it was clear
that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program
.Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made the colocation much more
real than many others</p><p>3 0.60402626 <a title="324-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-05-An_ICML_reject.html">177 hunch net-2006-05-05-An ICML reject</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hal,Daniel, and I have been working on the algorithmSearnfor structured
prediction. This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML,
and we were quite surprised. By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an
interesting algorithm.Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any
other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature
set. This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their
papers.Theoretical underpinning. Searn is a reduction which comes with a
reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good
performance for the overall system. No other theorem of this type has been
made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know.Speed.
Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we
tested against.Simplicity. Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-
specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to implement
Searn.Generality.</p><p>4 0.5825606 <a title="324-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-12-01-NIPS_tutorials_and_Vowpal_Wabbit_7.4.html">492 hunch net-2013-12-01-NIPS tutorials and Vowpal Wabbit 7.4</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At NIPS I'm giving atutorial on Learning to Interact. In essence this is about
dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious
tutorials, I'll be covering several new results that changed my understanding
of the nature of the problem. Note thatJudea PearlandElias Bareinboimhave
atutorial on causality. This might appear similar, but is quite different in
practice. Pearl and Bareinboim's tutorial will be about the general concepts
while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,
including code. Luckily, they have the right order. I recommend going to bothI
also just released version 7.4 ofVowpal Wabbit. When I was a frustrated
learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and
addressing the issues. One of the issues is that machine learning itself was
not automatic enough, while another is that creating a very low overhead

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.49676377 <a title="324-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>

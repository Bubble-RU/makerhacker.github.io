<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.

Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>3 0.32377276 <a title="285-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>4 0.29099491 <a title="285-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-02-2006_NIPS_workshops.html">216 hunch net-2006-11-02-2006 NIPS workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I expect the  NIPS 2006 workshops  to be quite interesting, and recommend going for anyone interested in machine learning research.

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>6 0.22154887 <a title="285-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-15-NIPS_workshops_extended_to_3_days.html">266 hunch net-2007-10-15-NIPS workshops extended to 3 days</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (Unofficially, at least.)  The  Deep Learning Workshop  is being held the afternoon before the rest of the workshops in Vancouver, BC.  Separate registration is needed, and open.
 
Whatâ&euro;&trade;s happening fundamentally here is that there are too many interesting workshops to fit into 2 days.

 Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, Canada 
  
NIPS is larger than all of the other learning conferences, partly because itâ&euro;&trade;s the only one at that time of year.

<p>Introduction: Since  John  did not attend  COLT  this year, I have been volunteered to report back on the hot stuff at this year’s meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all the three days. I’m gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program in a chronological order.
 
The first session on matrices seemed interesting for two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally make their entry at COLT. The paper of  Ohad  and  Shai  on  Collaborative Filtering with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducing  provides non-trivial guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina and  Nati  show how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for matrix completion problems in their paper  Concentr</p><p>3 0.54753792 <a title="285-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-07-The_Limits_of_Learning_Theory.html">90 hunch net-2005-07-07-The Limits of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and proving theorems about learning.  Could he solve machine learning?
 
The answer is “no”.   This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.   
 
There are several ways to conclude that some  bias  is necessary in order to succesfully learn.  For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification.  At prediction time, we observe some features  X  and want to make a prediction of either  0  or  1 .   Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on past experience.  In order to learn we must:
  
 Have a bias.  Always predicting  0  is as likely as  1  is useless. 
 Have the “right” bias.  Predicting  1  when the answer is  0  is also not helpful. 
  
The implication of “have a bias” is that we can not design effective learning algorithms with “a uniform prior over all possibilities”.  The implication of “have the ‘right’ bias” is that our mathematician fails since “right” is defined wi</p><p>4 0.54387742 <a title="285-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  Attendance was 268, significantly larger than  last year .  My impression was that the event mostly still fit the space, although it was crowded.  If anyone has suggestions for next year, speak up.
 
The best student paper award went to  Sergiu Goschin  for a cool video of how his system learned to play video games (I can’t find the paper online yet).  Choosing amongst the submitted talks was pretty difficult this year, as there were many similarly good ones.
 
By coincidence all the invited talks were (at least potentially) about faster learning algorithms.   Stephen Boyd  talked about  ADMM .  Leon Bottou  spoke on single pass online learning via  averaged SGD .   Yoav Freund  talked about  parameter-free hedging .  In Yoav’s case the talk was mostly about a better theoretical learning algorithm, but it has the potential to unlock an exponential computational complexity improvement via oraclization of experts algorithms… but some serious</p><p>5 0.54245883 <a title="285-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-15-ESPgame_and_image_labeling.html">20 hunch net-2005-02-15-ESPgame and image labeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn  has been running the  espgame  for awhile now.  The espgame provides a picture to two randomly paired people across the web, and asks them to agree on a label.  It hasn’t managed to label the web yet, but it has produced a  large dataset  of (image, label) pairs.  I organized the dataset so you could  explore the implied bipartite graph  (requires much bandwidth).
 
Relative to other image datasets, this one is quite large—67000 images, 358,000 labels (average of 5/image with variation from 1 to 19), and 22,000 unique labels (one every 3 images).  The dataset is also very ‘natural’, consisting of images spidered from the internet.  The multiple label characteristic is intriguing because ‘learning to learn’ and metalearning techniques may be applicable.  The ‘natural’ quality means that this dataset varies greatly in difficulty from easy (predicting “red”) to hard (predicting “funny”) and potentially more rewarding to tackle.

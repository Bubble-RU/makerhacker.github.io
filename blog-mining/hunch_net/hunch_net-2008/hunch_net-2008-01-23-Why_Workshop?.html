<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.21828006 <a title="285-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>4 0.21344732 <a title="285-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due
January 18, two weeks before papers.Similarly,Ben Taskaris looking for
goodtutorials, which is complementary. Workshops are about exploring a
subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught
essence, a vital part of the research process. Tutorials are due February 13,
two weeks after papers.</p><p>5 0.16024004 <a title="285-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">488 hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manikand I are organizing theextreme classificationworkshop at NIPS this year.
We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage
anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9. I believe this
is an idea whose time has now come.The NIPS website doesn't have other
workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant
interest.</p><p>6 0.14289701 <a title="285-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We'd like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop
on kernel learning. While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels
from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature
selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no
restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression,
classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be
considered. The deadline for submissions isOctober 24.More detail can be
foundhere.Corinna Cortes, Arthur Gretton, Gert Lanckriet, Mehryar Mohri,

<p>Introduction: I just createdversion 5.1ofvowpal wabbit. This almost entirely a bugfix
release, so it's an easy upgrade from v5.0.In addition:There is now amailing
list, which I and several other developers are subscribed to.The main website
has shifted to the wiki on github. This means that anyone with a github
account can now edit it.I'm planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it

interested.The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.
When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in
terms of features. At this point, many other projects have started to
appreciate the value of the design choices here. This includes:Mahout, which
now has an SGD implementation.Shogun, whereSoerenis keen onincorporating
features.LibLinear, where they won the KDD best paper award forout-of-core
learning.This is expected--any open source approach which works well should be
widely adopted.

<p>Introduction: This post is about contextual bandit problems where, repeatedly:The world
chooses featuresxand rewards for each actionr1,â&euro;Ś,rkthen announces the
featuresx(but not the rewards).A policy chooses an actiona.The world announces
the rewardraThe goal in these situations is to learn a policy which
maximizesrain expectation efficiently. I'm thinking about all situations which
fit the above setting, whether they are drawn IID or adversarially from round
to round and whether they involve past logged data or rapidly learning via
interaction.One common drawback of all algorithms for solving this setting, is
that they have a poor dependence on the number of actions. For example ifkis
the number of actions,EXP4 (page 66)has a dependence onk0.5,epoch-greedy(and
the simpler epsilon greedy) have a dependence onk1/3, and theoffset treehas a
dependence onk-1. These results aren't directly comparable because different
things are being analyzed. The fact thatallanalyses have poor dependence onkis

<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale learning challengefor ICML interests me a great deal, although
I have concerns about the way it is structured.From theinstructions page,
several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly
find a good solution.mediumA dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.largeA large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.By this definition, all of the datasets are medium
sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning
algorithms that don't require random access to examples.No Loading TimeThe

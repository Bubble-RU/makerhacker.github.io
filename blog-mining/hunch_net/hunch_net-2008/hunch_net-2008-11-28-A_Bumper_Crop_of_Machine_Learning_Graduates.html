<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated thatdecision trees qualify as a deep learning
algorithmbecause they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in
the input representation.Ping Lihasproved this correct, empiricallyatUAIby
showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions
ofMnistwhich are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by
deep learning algorithms.This is an important point, because the ability to
solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a
deep learning algorithm we have. I'm not that surprised. In my experience, if
you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they
can achieve pretty good performance.Geoff Hintononce told me that the great
thing about deep belief networks is that they work. I understand that Ping had
very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some
reviewers step up to the standard of valuing what works.</p><p>3 0.13818893 <a title="329-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-18-Radford_Neal_starts_a_blog.html">313 hunch net-2008-08-18-Radford Neal starts a blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of

<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

adoption ofdeep learning for speech recognition.Significantindustry

<p>Introduction: A couple security researchersclaim to have cracked the netflix dataset. The
claims of success appear somewhat overstated to me, but the method of attack
is valid and could plausibly be substantially improved so as to reveal the
movie preferences of a small fraction of Netflix users.The basic idea is to
use a heuristic similarity function between ratings in a public database (from
IMDB) and an anonymized database (Netflix) to link ratings in the private
database to public identities (in IMDB). They claim to have linked two of a
few dozen IMDB users to anonymized netflix users.The claims seem a bit
inflated to me, because (a) knowing the IMDB identity isn't equivalent to
knowing the person and (b) the claims of statistical significance are with
respect to a model of the world they created (rather than one they
created).Overall, this is another example showing that completeprivacy is
hard. It may be worth remembering that there are some substantial benefits

<p>Introduction: When presenting part of theReinforcement Learning theory tutorialatICML 2006,
I was forcibly reminded of this.There are several difficulties.When creating
the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky. With too much detail,
the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom. With too
little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very
difficult to judge.What may be an easy step in the careful thought of a quiet
room is not so easy when you are occupied by the process of presentation.What
may be easy after having gone over this (and other) proofs is not so easy to
follow in the first pass by a viewer.These problems seem only correctable by
process of repeated test-and-revise.When presenting the proof, simply speaking
with sufficient precision is substantially harder than in normal conversation
(where precision is not so critical). Practice can help here.When presenting
the proof, going at the right pace for understanding is difficult. When</p><p>3 0.92192155 <a title="329-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-04-Watchword%3A_model.html">135 hunch net-2005-12-04-Watchword: model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some
system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts
some alteration of the real-world system. In machine learning "model" has
several variant definitions.Everyday. The common definition is sometimes
used.Parameterized. Sometimes model is a short-hand for "parameterized model".
Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters. In the Bayesian
learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday)
models.Predictive. Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.
Examples of this are "my model is a decision tree" or "my model is a support
vector machine". Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the
underlying process. For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about
how alterations to the real-world system would create a change.Which
definition is being used at any particular time is important information. For
example, if it's a parameterized or p</p><p>4 0.91322708 <a title="329-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-23-Interesting_papers_at_ACL.html">97 hunch net-2005-07-23-Interesting papers at ACL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Arecent discussionindicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow
people to post comments about recent papers that they liked. I think this
could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests
but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.ACL 2005recently
completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were
either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.David
Chiang,A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation.
(Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that
is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually
translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical
model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you
can learn things like "X 's Y" -> "Y de X" in chinese, where X and Y are
arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, which

<p>Introduction: "Assumption" is another word to be careful with in machine learning because it
is used in several ways.Assumption = BiasThere are several ways to see that
some form of 'bias' (= preferring of one solution over another) is necessary.
This is obvious in an adversarial setting. A good bit of work has been
expended explaining this in other settings with "no free lunch" theorems. This
is a usage specialized to learning which is particularly common when talking
about priors for Bayesian Learning.Assumption = "if" of a theoremThe
assumptions are the 'if' part of the 'if-then' in a theorem. This is a fairly
common usage.Assumption = AxiomThe assumptions are the things that we assume
are true, but which we cannot verify. Examples are "the IID assumption" or "my
problem is a DNF on a small number of bits". This is the usage which I
prefer.One difficulty with any use of the word "assumption" is that you often
encounter "ifassumptionthenconclusionso ifnot assumptionthennot conclusion".

<p>Introduction: Carnegie MellonSchool of Computer Sciencehas the first academicMachine
Learning department. This department already existed as theCenter for
Automated Learning and Discovery, but recently changed it's name.The reason
for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as
"Automated Learner and Discoverers", but there are number of people who think
of themselves as "Machine Learners". Machine learning is both more succinct
and recognizable--good properties for a name.A more interesting question is
"Should there be a Machine Learning Department?".Tom Mitchellhas a
relevantwhitepaperclaiming that machine learning is answering a different
question than other fields or departments. The fundamental debate here is "Is
machine learning different from statistics?"At a cultural level, there is no
real debate: they are different. Machine learning is characterized by several
very active large peer reviewed conferences, operating in a computer science
mode. Statistics tends to fun</p><p>4 0.13818893 <a title="313-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-28-A_Bumper_Crop_of_Machine_Learning_Graduates.html">329 hunch net-2008-11-28-A Bumper Crop of Machine Learning Graduates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My impression is that this is a particularly strong year for machine learning
graduates. Here's my short list of the strong graduates I know. Analpha (for
perversity's sake) by last name:Jenn Wortmann. When Jenn visited us for the
summer, she hadone,two,three,fourpapers. That is typical--she's smart,
capable, and follows up many directions of research. I believe approximately
all of her many papers are on different subjects.Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
AScience paper on bijective dimensionality reduction, mastered and improved on
deep belief nets which seems like an important flavor of nonlinear learning,
and in my experience he's very fast, capable and creative at problem
solving.Marc'Aurelio Ranzato. I haven't spoken with Marc very much, but he had
a great visit at Yahoo! this summer, and has an impressive portfolio of
applications and improvements on convolutional neural networks and other deep
learning algorithms.Lihong Li. Lihong developed theKWIK ("Knows what it

<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.Barriers in Computational Learning
Theory Workshop, Aug 28.That's tomorrow near Princeton. I'm looking forward to
speaking at this one on "Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory", but
several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory
inclined.Claudia Perlichis running theINFORMS Data Mining Contestwith a
deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they
partnered withHealthCare Intelligence) to predict transfers and mortality. In
the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we
hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions.The
Singularity Summit October 3&4\. This is for the AIists out there. Several of
the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I'll miss it
forALT.Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21. This is stretching the
definition of "New York Area" a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable. This
is a conference of case studies</p><p>6 0.11197843 <a title="313-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-19-How_is_Compressed_Sensing_going_to_change_Machine_Learning_%3F.html">248 hunch net-2007-06-19-How is Compressed Sensing going to change Machine Learning ?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience
prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.The rate of flow of concepts simply

<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>5 0.23884672 <a title="313-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-22-Explicit_Randomization_in_Learning_algorithms.html">219 hunch net-2006-11-22-Explicit Randomization in Learning algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate
randomness into their execution. This includes at amongst others:Neural
Networks. Neural networks use randomization to assign initial
weights.Boltzmann Machines/Deep Belief Networks. Boltzmann machines are
something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression. The use
of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines, because the predicted
value at test time also uses randomness.Bagging. Bagging is a process where a
learning algorithm is run several different times on several different
datasets, creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote.Policy
descent. Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such asConservative
Policy Iterationuse random bits to create stochastic policies.Experts
algorithms. Randomized weighted majority use random bits as a part of the
prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees.A basic question
is: "Should there be explicit randomization in learn</p><p>6 0.18185014 <a title="313-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>

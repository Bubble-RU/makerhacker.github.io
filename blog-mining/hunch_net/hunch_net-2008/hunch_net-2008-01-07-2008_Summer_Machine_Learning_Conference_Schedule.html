<p>Introduction: The Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition is about to get started.  The aim of the competition is to facilitate direct comparisons between various learning methods on important and realistic domains.  This yearâ&euro;&trade;s event will feature well-known benchmark domains as well as more challenging problems of real-world complexity, such as helicopter control and robot soccer keepaway.
 
The competition begins on November 1st, 2007 when training software is released.   Results must be submitted by July 1st, 2008.  The competition will culminate in an event at ICML-08 in Helsinki, Finland, at which the winners will be announced.

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>6 0.17451827 <a title="283-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually mandatory for success.  Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen at conferences.  If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one summer conference.  Your advisor should cover the costs.

<p>Introduction: Many different paper deadlines are coming up soon so I made a little reference table.  Out of curiosity, I also computed the interval between submission deadline and conference.

It looks like the northeastern US is the big winner as far as location this year.</p><p>4 0.34113809 <a title="283-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:
  
 Updating to  WordPress  1.5. 
 Installing and heavily tweaking the  Geekniche  theme.  Update: I switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme. 
 Adding the  Customizable Post Listings  plugin. 
 Installing the  StatTraq  plugin. 
 Updating some of the links.  I particularly recommend looking at the  computer research policy  blog. 
 Adding  threaded comments .  This doesn’t thread old comments obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones. 
  
Overall, I think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of my  earlier problems .  If you have any difficulties or anything seems “not quite right”, please speak up.  A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>5 0.33093628 <a title="283-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-09-Intuitions_from_applied_learning.html">16 hunch net-2005-02-09-Intuitions from applied learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it’s good to pay attention to basic intuitions of applied learning.  Here are a few I’ve collected.
  
  Integration   In Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this integral.  This phenomena seems to be far more general.  Bagging, Boosting, SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent.  The phenomena is more general: you can average over many different  classification predictors  to improve performance.  Sources:  Zoubin ,  Caruana  
  Differentiation  Different pieces of an average should differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods.  This is know as the ‘symmetry breaking’ problem for neural networks, and it’s why weights are initialized randomly.   Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems.  Sources:  Yann LeCun ,  Phil Long

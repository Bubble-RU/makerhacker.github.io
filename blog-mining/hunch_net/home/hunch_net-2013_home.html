<p>Introduction: At NIPS I'm giving atutorial on Learning to Interact. In essence this is about
dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious
tutorials, I'll be covering several new results that changed my understanding
of the nature of the problem. Note thatJudea PearlandElias Bareinboimhave
atutorial on causality. This might appear similar, but is quite different in
practice. Pearl and Bareinboim's tutorial will be about the general concepts
while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,
including code. Luckily, they have the right order. I recommend going to bothI
also just released version 7.4 ofVowpal Wabbit. When I was a frustrated
learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and
addressing the issues. One of the issues is that machine learning itself was
not automatic enough, while another is that creating a very low overhead

<p>Introduction: I was not as personally close toBenasSam, but the level of tragedy is similar
and I can't help but be greatly saddened by the loss.Variousnewsstorieshave
coverage, but the synopsis is that he had a heart attack on Sunday and is
survived by his wife Anat and daughter Aviv. There is discussion of creating a
memorial fund for them, which I hope comes to fruition, and plan to contribute
to.I will remember Ben as someone who thought carefully and comprehensively
about new ways to do things, then fought hard and successfully for what he
believed in. It is an ideal we strive for, that Ben accomplished.Edit:

<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

<p>Introduction: There will be no New York ML Symposium this year. The core issue is thatNYASis
disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current
candidate a spring symposium on March 28.Gunnarand I were outvoted here--we
were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee
wants to wait.In some good news, most of theICML 2012 videoshave been restored
from a deep backup.</p><p>5 <a title="hunch_net-2013-488" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manikand I are organizing theextreme classificationworkshop at NIPS this year.
We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage
anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9. I believe this
is an idea whose time has now come.The NIPS website doesn't have other
workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant
interest.</p><p>6 <a title="hunch_net-2013-487" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-24-ICML_2012_videos_lost.html">hunch net-2013-07-24-ICML 2012 videos lost</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big ouch--all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle. Rajnish sends
the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------Sincere apologies to ICML
community for loosing 2012 archived videosWhat happened: In order to publish
2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a
weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the
current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service,
the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had
ignored while removing the data from previous server.What are we doing about
this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can
retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make
sure this does not happen again in future:(1) We are going to create a channel
on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p-</p><p>7 <a title="hunch_net-2013-486" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-10-Thoughts_on_Artificial_Intelligence.html">hunch net-2013-07-10-Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at theICML 2013
Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models. Although there's aPDF available
on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>10 <a title="hunch_net-2013-483" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-10-The_Large_Scale_Learning_class_notes.html">hunch net-2013-06-10-The Large Scale Learning class notes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale machine learning classI taught withYann LeCunhas finished. As I
expected, it took quite a bit of time. We had about 25 people attending in
person on average and 400 regularly watching therecorded lectureswhich is
substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML
class. We also had some fun with class projects--I'm hopeful that several will
eventually turn into papers.I expect there are a number of professors
interested in lecturing on this and related topics. Everyone will have their
personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some
convergence to common course materials as well. To help with this, I am making
thesources to my presentations available. Feel free to

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>12 <a title="hunch_net-2013-481" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-04-15-NEML_II.html">hunch net-2013-04-15-NEML II</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yann LeCunand I are coteaching a class onLarge Scale Machine Learningstarting
late Januaryat NYU. This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning
working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with
several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the
previous.This is not a beginning class--you really need to have taken a basic
machine learning class previously to follow along. Students will be able to
run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms sinceYahoo!has donated
servers which are being configured into a small scaleHadoopcluster. We are
planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so
good class projects could easily lead to papers.For me, this is a chance to
teach on many topics of past research. In general, it seems like researchers
should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of
teachability and to see their own research through that lens. More generally,

<p>Introduction: 2012 was a tumultuous year for me, but it was undeniably a great year for deep
learning efforts. Signs of this include:Winning aKaggle competition.Wide
adoption ofdeep learning for speech recognition.Significantindustry
support.Gains inimagerecognition.This is a rare event in research: a
significant capability breakout. Congratulations are definitely in order for
those who managed to achieve it. At this point, deep learning algorithms seem
like a choice undeniably worth investigating for real applications with
significant data.</p><br/><br/><br/>

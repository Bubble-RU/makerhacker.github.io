<p>Introduction: TheNew York Timeshas an article on thegrowth of spam. Interesting facts
include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly
useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist
of an image only) are on the growth.Estimates of the cost of spam are almost
certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by
people.The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should
be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning
technology. For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few
formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with
RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture. The
mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.
This is the next step in the spam war.The response to this system is to make
the image based spam even more random. We should (essentially) expect to

<p>Introduction: A substantial difficulty with the 2009 and 2008ICML discussion systemwas a
communication vacuum, where authors were not informed of comments, and
commenters were not informed of responses to their comments without explicit
monitoring.Mark Reidhas setup anew discussion system for 2010with the goal of
addressing this.Mark didn't want to make it to intrusive, so you must opt-in.

<p>Introduction: AlinaandJakepoint out the COLTCall for Open Questionsdue May 11. In general,
this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question. In my
case, I particularly enjoyedcrafting an open questionwith precisely a form
such that acritic targeting my paperswould be forced to confront their fallacy
or make a case for the reward. But less esoterically, this is a way to get the
attention of some very smart people focused on a problem that really matters,
which is the real value.</p><p>5 0.10450982 <a title="367-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>6 0.10380571 <a title="367-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At thelast ICML,Tom Dietterichasked me to look into systems for commenting on
papers. I've been slow getting to this, but it's relevant now.The essential
observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they
are not yet much used in academic research. If we can find the right way to
use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the
first conference that manages to really create an online community. Various
conferences have been poking at this. For example,UAI has setup a wiki, COLT
hasstarted usingJoomla, with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting
up a "student blog". Similarly,Dinoj Surendransetup a twiki for theChicago
Machine Learning Summer School, which was quite useful for coordinating events
and other things.I believe the most important thing is a willingness to
experiment. A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference
websites. For example, theICML 2007 papers pageis basically only useful via
grep. A mu</p><p>6 0.45807925 <a title="367-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The New York Times had ashort interviewabout machine learning in datamining
being used pervasively by the IRS and large corporations to predict who to
audit and who to target for various marketing campaigns. This is a big
application area of machine learning. It can be harmful (learning + databases
= another way to invade privacy) or beneficial (as google demonstrates, better
targeting of marketing campaigns is far less annoying). This is yet more
evidence that we can not rely upon "I'm just another fish in the school" logic
for our expectations about treatment by government and large corporations.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8137694 <a title="367-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-16-Centmail_comments.html">367 hunch net-2009-08-16-Centmail comments</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique
sites p</p><p>4 0.55635273 <a title="367-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-10-A_Deep_Belief_Net_Learning_Problem.html">227 hunch net-2007-01-10-A Deep Belief Net Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of
reviewing where almost no one is happy. A basic question is: Should most
people be happy?The case against is straightforward. Anyone who watches the
flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.
By it's nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless,
and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit. If you
think about this for a moment, it's very different from most other human
endeavors. The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager,
conductor, quarterback, etcâ&euro;Ś all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even
a vaguely predictive sense of what's important in the longer term, then most
people submitting papers will be unhappy.But this argument unravels, in my
experience. Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a
small part being simply malicious. And yet, I'm sure that most reviewers
genuinely believe th</p><p>6 0.51479214 <a title="367-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-22-KDD_2010.html">406 hunch net-2010-08-22-KDD 2010</a></p>

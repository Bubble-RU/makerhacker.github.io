<p>Introduction: Suppose we have a set of observations over timex1,x2,…,xtand want to predict
some future eventyt+1. An inevitable problem arises, because learning a
predictorh(x1,…,xt)ofyt+1is generically intractable due to the size of the
input. To make this problem tractable, what's necessary is a method for
summarizing the relevant information in past observations for the purpose of
prediction in the future. In other words, state is required.Existing
approaches for deriving state have some limitations.Hidden Markov
modelslearned with EM suffer from local minima, use tabular learning
approaches which provide dubious generalization ability, and often require
substantial a.priori specification of the observations.Kalman
FiltersandParticle Filtersare very parametric in the sense that substantial
information must be specified up front.Dynamic Bayesian Networks (graphical
modelsthrough time) require substantial a.priori specification and often
require the solution of difficult computational problems to u</p><p>4 0.15509002 <a title="337-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-10-Aggregation_of_estimators%2C_sparsity_in_high_dimension_and_computational_feasibility.html">398 hunch net-2010-05-10-Aggregation of estimators, sparsity in high dimension and computational feasibility</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (I'm channeling forJean-Yves Audiberthere, with some minor tweaking for
clarity.)SinceNemirovski'sSaint Flour lecture notes, numerous researchers have
studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well
as(MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice;
model = finite set of d functions)(C) the best convex combination of these
functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions)(L) the best linear
combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d
functions)It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov's COLT'03 paper)
that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess
risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n
for (L), where n is the training set size. Here, "risk" is amount of extra
loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.The
practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial statements
like: do not use the</p><p>5 0.15481076 <a title="337-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>6 0.15274243 <a title="337-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-16-Observations_on_Linearity_for_Reductions_to_Regression.html">327 hunch net-2008-11-16-Observations on Linearity for Reductions to Regression</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Suppose you have a dataset with 2 terafeatures (we only count nonzero entries
in a datamatrix), and want to learn a good linear predictor in a reasonable
amount of time. How do you do it? As a learning theorist, the first thing you
do is pray that this is too much data for the number of parameters--but that's
not the case, there are around 16 billion examples, 16 million parameters, and
people really care about a high quality predictor, so subsampling is not a
good strategy.Alekhvisited us last summer, and we had a breakthrough
(seeherefor details), coming up with the first learning algorithm I've seen
that is provably faster thanany futuresingle machine learning algorithm. The
proof of this is simple: We can output a optimal-up-to-precision linear
predictor faster than the data can be streamed through the network interface
of any single machine involved in the computation.It is necessary but not
sufficient to have an effective communication infrastructure. It is necessary

<p>Introduction: YoramandShai'sonline learning tutorialatICMLbrings up a question for me, "Why
use thedual?"The basic setting is learning a weight vectorwiso that the
functionf(x)= sumiwixioptimizes some convex loss function.The functional view
of the dual is that instead of (or in addition to) keeping track ofwiover the
feature space, you keep track of a vectorajover the examples and definewi=
sumjajxji.The above view of duality makes operating in the dual appear
unnecessary, because in the end a weight vector is always used. The tutorial
suggests that thinking about the dual gives a unified algorithmic font for
deriving online learning algorithms. I haven't worked with the dual
representation much myself, but I have seen a few examples where it appears
helpful.NoiseWhen doing online optimization (i.e. online learning where you
are allowed to look at individual examples multiple times), the dual
representation may be helpful in dealing with noisy labels.RatesOne annoyance

<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for thereductions
tutorialAlina,Bianca, and I are planning to do atICML. Please come, if you are
interested.Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building
new useful abstractions. The running example I'll use islearning
reductionswhere I have experience. The basic abstraction here is that we can
build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a
small expected regret. This is used repeatedly to solve more complex
problems.In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many
substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly
difficult.It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism
for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits. People rarely
see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new
abstractions. Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, you
often don't know the right way to</p><p>6 0.66147709 <a title="337-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-10-A_Deep_Belief_Net_Learning_Problem.html">227 hunch net-2007-01-10-A Deep Belief Net Learning Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it's good to pay attention to
basic intuitions of applied learning. Here are a few I've
collected.IntegrationIn Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an
integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this
integral. This phenomena seems to be far more general. Bagging, Boosting,
SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent. The
phenomena is more general: you can average over many differentclassification
predictorsto improve performance.
Sources:Zoubin,CaruanaDifferentiationDifferent pieces of an average should
differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods. This is know
as the 'symmetry breaking' problem for neural networks, and it's why weights
are initialized randomly. Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good
differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems. Sources:Yann

<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

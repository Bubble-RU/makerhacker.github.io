<p>Introduction: Given John's recent posts on CMU's new machine learning department and "Deep
Learning," I asked for an opportunity to give a computational learning theory
perspective on these issues.To my mind, the answer to the question "Are the
core problems from machine learning different from the core problems of
statistics?" is a clear Yes. The point of this post is to describe a core
problem in machine learning that is computational in nature and will appeal to
statistical learning folk (as an extreme example note that if P=NP- which, for
all we know, is true- then we would suddenly find almost all of our favorite
machine learning problems considerably more tractable).If the central question
of statistical learning theory were crudely summarized as "given a hypothesis
with a certain loss bound over a test set, how well will it generalize?" then
the central question of computational learning theory might be "how can we
find such a hypothesis efficently (e.g., in polynomial-time)?"With this in

<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>4 0.13051057 <a title="334-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-27-Reviewing_Horror_Stories.html">304 hunch net-2008-06-27-Reviewing Horror Stories</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>5 0.12869337 <a title="334-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the "right" way to do
machine learning. This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.
The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a
reply2.The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and
general. Essentially, you first specify a priorP(D)over possible
processesDproducing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data
according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)After
this, hard decisions are made (such as "turn left" or "turn right") by
choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior)
loss.This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices
ofP(D)and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice
properties:There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual
distribution generating the data is drawn fromP(D)there is no better method.

This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised
learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b) makes
semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.There were two papers
with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear
regression, both reducing the sample complexity to . One wasNicolo Cesa-

<p>Introduction: Suppose we have a set of observations over timex1,x2,…,xtand want to predict
some future eventyt+1. An inevitable problem arises, because learning a
predictorh(x1,…,xt)ofyt+1is generically intractable due to the size of the
input. To make this problem tractable, what's necessary is a method for
summarizing the relevant information in past observations for the purpose of
prediction in the future. In other words, state is required.Existing
approaches for deriving state have some limitations.Hidden Markov
modelslearned with EM suffer from local minima, use tabular learning
approaches which provide dubious generalization ability, and often require
substantial a.priori specification of the observations.Kalman
FiltersandParticle Filtersare very parametric in the sense that substantial
information must be specified up front.Dynamic Bayesian Networks (graphical

require the solution of difficult computational problems to u</p><p>4 0.59750199 <a title="334-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-09-Some_NIPS_papers.html">138 hunch net-2005-12-09-Some NIPS papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here is a set of papers that I found interesting (and why).A PAC-Bayes
approach to the Set Covering Machineimproves the set covering machine. The set
covering machine approach is a new way to do classification characterized by a
very close connection between theory and algorithm. At this point, the
approach seems to be competing well with SVMs in about all dimensions: similar
computational speed, similar accuracy, stronger learning theory guarantees,
more general information source (a kernel has strictly more structure than a
metric), and more sparsity. Developing a classification algorithm is not very
easy, but the results so far are encouraging.Off-Road Obstacle Avoidance
through End-to-End LearningandLearning Depth from Single Monocular Imagesboth
effectively showed that depth information can be predicted from camera images
(using notably different techniques). This ability is strongly enabling
because cameras are cheap, tiny, light, and potentially provider longer range

<p>Introduction: The prevailing wisdom in machine learning seems to be that motivating a paper
is the responsibility of the author. I think this is a harmful view--instead,
it's healthier for the community to regard this as the responsibility of the
reviewer.There are lots of reasons to prefer a reviewer-responsibility
approach.Authors are the most biased possible source of information about the
motivation of the paper. Systems which rely upon very biased sources of
information are inherently unreliable.Authors are highly variable in their
ability and desire to express motivation for their work. This adds greatly to
variance on acceptance of an idea, and it can systematically discriminate or
accentuate careers. It's great if you have a career accentuated by awesome
wording choice, but wise decision making by reviewers is important for the
field.The motivation section in a paper doesn'tdoanything in some sense--it's
there to get the paper in. Reading the motivation of a paper is of little use

<p>Introduction: Sham Kakadepoints out that we are missing a bound.Suppose we
havemsamplesxdrawn IID from some distributionD. Through the magic of
exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the
deviations likeO(I/m0.5)(at least in crude form). A proof is on page 9here.If
the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying
to find a predictor with 0 expected los</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89571846 <a title="334-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-07-Interesting_Papers_at_SODA_2009.html">334 hunch net-2009-01-07-Interesting Papers at SODA 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year's SODA
.Maria-Florina Balcan,Avrim Blum, andAnupam Gupta,Approximate Clustering
without the Approximation. This paper gives reasonable algorithms with
provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of
clustering. It's conceptually interesting, because it's the second example
I've seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition
subtle but reasonable way. Essentially, they show that if any near-
approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it's computationally easy
to find a near-optimal solution. This subtle shift bears serious thought. A
similar one occurred inour ranking paperwith respect to minimum feedback
arcset. With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete
problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.Yury

<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I've never
seen taught (in full generality), but which I've found very useful.Many
problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult. The best
known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean 'discretely
difficult' in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by
examples.ERMIn empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate
classifier from a set of classifiers. This is NP hard for common sets, but it
can be much harder, depending on the set.ExpertsIn the online learning with
experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of
(adversarial) experts. Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an
adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that
grows exponentially.Policy IterationThe problem with policy iteration is that
you learn a new policy with respect to an old policy, which implies that
simply adopting the new polic</p><p>5 0.88205373 <a title="334-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>

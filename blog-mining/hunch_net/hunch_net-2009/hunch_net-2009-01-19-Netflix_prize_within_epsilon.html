<p>Introduction: In October 2006, the online movie renter, Netflix, announced theNetflix
Prizecontest. They published a comprehensive dataset including more than 100
million movie ratings, which were performed by about 480,000 real customers on
17,770 movies.Ã‚ÂCompetitors in the challenge are required to estimate a few
million ratings.Ã‚ÂTo win the "grand prize," they need to deliver a 10%
improvement in the prediction error compared with the results of Cinematch,
Netflix's proprietary recommender system. Best current results deliver
9.12%improvement, which is quite close to the 10% goal, yet painfully
distant.Ã‚ÂThe Netflix Prize breathed new life and excitement into recommender
systems research. The competition allowed the wide research community to
access a large scale, real life dataset. Beyond this, the competition changed
the rules of the game. Claiming that your nice idea could outperform some

<p>Introduction: TheHeritage Health Prizeis potentially the largest prediction prize yet at
$3M, which is sure to get many people interested. Several elements of the
competition may be worth discussing.The most straightforward way for HPN to
deploy this predictor is in determining who to cover with insurance. This
might easily cover the costs of running the contest itself, but the value to
the health system of a whole is minimal, as people not covered still exist.
While HPN itself is a provider network, they have active relationships with a
number of insurance companies, and the right to resell any entrant. It's worth
keeping in mind that the research and development may nevertheless end up
being useful in the longer term, especially as entrants also keep the right to
their code.Thejudging metricis something I haven't seen previously. If a
patient has probability 0.5 of being in the hospital 0 days and probability
0.5 of being in the hospital ~53.6 days, the optimal prediction in expectation
is ~6.4 da</p><p>4 0.49403301 <a title="336-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-14-BellKor_wins_Netflix.html">272 hunch net-2007-11-14-BellKor wins Netflix</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The competitors for theNetflix Prizeare tantalizingly close winning the
million dollar prize. This year,BellKorandCommendo Researchsent a combined
solution that won theprogress prize. Reading thewriteups2is instructive.
Several aspects of solutions are taken for granted including stochastic
gradient descent, ensemble prediction, and targeting residuals (a form of
boosting). Relatively to last year, it appears that many approaches have added
parameterizations, especially for the purpose of modeling through time.The big
question is: will they make the big prize? At this point, the level of
complexity in entering the competition is prohibitive, so perhaps only the
existing competitors will continue to try. (This equation might change
drastically if the teams open source their existing solutions, including
parameter settings.) One fear is that the progress is asymptoting on the wrong
side of the 10% threshold. In the first year, the teams progressed through
84.3% of the 10% gap, and in the</p><p>2 0.85089171 <a title="336-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-28-The_Coming_Patent_Apocalypse.html">241 hunch net-2007-04-28-The Coming Patent Apocalypse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic. The
truth is even worse--the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in
ways that will require much more significant reform thanis being considered
now.The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for
inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while
making the invention available to all. This myth sounds pretty desirable, but
the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.There are
many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two
of them:Patent TrollsThe way that patents have generally worked over the last
several decades is that they were a tool of large companies. Large companies
would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other's
patents--in effect saying "we agree to owe each other nothing". Smaller
companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they didn't
have enough p</p><p>3 0.84068644 <a title="336-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheICMLpaper deadline has passed.Joelleand I were surprised to see the number
of submissions jump from last year by about 50% to around 900 submissions. A
tiny portion of these are immediate rejects(*), so this is a much larger set
of papers than expected. The number of workshop submissions also doubled
compared to last year, so ICML may grow significantly this year, if we can
manage to handle the load well. The prospect of making 900 good decisions is
fundamentally daunting, and success will rely heavily on theprogram
committeeandarea chairsat this point.For those who want to rubberneck a bit
more, here's a breakdown of submissions by primary topic of submitted
papers:66 Reinforcement Learning 52 Supervised Learning 51 Clustering 46

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of
truth.Ifnplayers each play each other, you have a tournament. How do you order
the players from weakest to strongest?The standard first attempt is "find the
ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as
possible". This is called the "minimum feedback arcset" problem in the CS
theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem. A basic guarantee
holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some "true" intrinsic
ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagreesktimes (due to noise for
instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering
on at most2kedges (and no solution can be better).One standard approach to
tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an
approximation guarantee. For example,Don Coppersmith,Lisa FleischerandAtri
Rudraproved thatordering players according to the number of wins is a
5-approximation to the NP-hard proble</p><p>5 0.80529237 <a title="336-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-15-COLT_Open_Problems.html">292 hunch net-2008-03-15-COLT Open Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLT has acall for open problemsdue March 21. I encourage anyone with a
specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in. Just the effort of
specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for
my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it. To
increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the
solution. (Perhaps I should raise the$500 bountyon theK-fold cross-validation

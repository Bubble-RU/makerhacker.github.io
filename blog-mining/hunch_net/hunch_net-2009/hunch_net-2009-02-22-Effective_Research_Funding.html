<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>4 0.20032202 <a title="344-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-04-Research_Budget_Changes.html">154 hunch net-2006-02-04-Research Budget Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>2 0.89433122 <a title="344-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-23-Boosted_Decision_Trees_for_Deep_Learning.html">407 hunch net-2010-08-23-Boosted Decision Trees for Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated thatdecision trees qualify as a deep learning
algorithmbecause they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in
the input representation.Ping Lihasproved this correct, empiricallyatUAIby
showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions
ofMnistwhich are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by
deep learning algorithms.This is an important point, because the ability to
solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a
deep learning algorithm we have. I'm not that surprised. In my experience, if
you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they
can achieve pretty good performance.Geoff Hintononce told me that the great
thing about deep belief networks is that they work. I understand that Ping had
very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some
reviewers step up to the standard of valuing what works.</p><p>3 0.83358026 <a title="344-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>4 0.82631171 <a title="344-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-27-Reviewing_Horror_Stories.html">304 hunch net-2008-06-27-Reviewing Horror Stories</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>5 0.82100803 <a title="344-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-05-ICML_acceptance_statistics.html">466 hunch net-2012-06-05-ICML acceptance statistics</a></p>

</p><p>6 There are two effects going on: Does a recession cause us to refocus on other possibly better ideas? [sent-13, score-0.578]
</p><p>7 By far, most of the money invested by governments to fight the recession has gone towards survival, but a small fraction in the US is going towards other possibly better ideas, with a portion of that going towards research. [sent-16, score-0.929]
</p><p>8 We could hope for a larger fraction of money heading towards new ideas, rather than rescuing old, but there is a basic issue: the apparatus for creation and use of new ideas in the US is simply too small—it may not be able to effectively use more funding. [sent-17, score-0.589]
</p><p>9 In order to justify further funding for research, we may need to be more creative than simply “give us more”. [sent-18, score-0.519]
</p><p>10 Some research universities manage to achieve at least access and concentration to some extent, but hidden difficulties exist. [sent-31, score-0.692]
</p><p>11 I’m not extremely familiar with existing national labs, but I believe they often fail at (a)—at least research at national labs have had relatively little impact on newer fields such as computer science. [sent-33, score-0.858]
</p><p>12 So, my suggestion would be funding research in modes which satisfy all three desiderata. [sent-34, score-0.582]
</p><p>13 The natural and easy way to do this is by the government partially subsidizing basic research at those corporations which have decided to fund basic research. [sent-35, score-0.746]
</p><p>14 While this is precisely the conclusion you might expect from someone doing research at one of these places, it’s also what you would expect of someone intensely interested in research who sought out the best environment for research. [sent-37, score-0.472]
</p><p>15 Some people might think that basic research done at a university is inherently more desirable than the same in industry. [sent-40, score-0.566]
</p><p>16 For example, it seems that patentable research is about as likely to be patented at a university as elsewhere, and hence equally restricted for public use over the duration of a patent. [sent-42, score-0.389]
</p><p>17 Other people might think that basic research only really happens at universities or national labs, but that simply doesn’t agree with history. [sent-43, score-0.844]
</p><p>18 Given this, it’s odd that the rules for NSF funding, which is the premier source of funding for basic science in the US, generally requires university participation on proposals. [sent-44, score-0.425]
</p><p>19 This restriction naturally makes it easier for researchers at universities to acquire grant money than researchers not at universities. [sent-45, score-0.894]
</p><p>20 I don’t understand why this restriction is desirable from the viewpoint of a government wanting to effectively subsidize research. [sent-46, score-0.359]

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not?

<p>Introduction: Makc asked a good  question  in comments—”Why bother to make a paper, at all?”  There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately obvious to people not in academia.
 
The basic idea is that papers have considerably more utility than the obvious “present an idea”.
  
 Papers are a formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged on the number of papers they produce. 
 Papers have a formalized method of citing and crediting other—the bibliography.  Academics (especially older ones) are often judged on the number of citations they receive. 
 Papers enable a “more fair” anonymous review.  Conferences receive  many  papers, from which a subset are selected.  Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants to build a reputation for good work. 
 Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.  Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to friends about interesting problems while there.  Sometimes yo</p><p>2 0.97477263 <a title="344-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>3 0.97452021 <a title="344-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-02-26-Yahoo%21_ML_events.html">389 hunch net-2010-02-26-Yahoo! ML events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>4 0.96055949 <a title="344-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  ICML  paper deadline has passed.   Joelle  and I were surprised to see the number of submissions jump from last year by about 50% to around 900 submissions.  A tiny portion of these are immediate rejects(*), so this is a much larger set of papers than expected.  The number of workshop submissions also doubled compared to last year, so ICML may grow significantly this year, if we can manage to handle the load well.  The prospect of making 900 good decisions is fundamentally daunting, and success will rely heavily on the  program committee  and  area chairs  at this point.

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made since  Sanjoy  pointed out the significant  lack of theoretical understanding of active learning .  This is an update on the progress I know of.  As a refresher, active learning as meant here is:
  
 There is a source of unlabeled data. 
 There is an oracle from which labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source. 
 The goal is to perform well with minimal use of the oracle. 
  
Here is what I’ve learned:
  
 Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for active learning given the assumptions of IID data and “realizability” (that one of the classifiers is a correct classifier). 
  Nina ,  Alina , and I developed an algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data.  A draft is  here . 
  Nicolo ,  Claudio , and  Luca  showed that it is possible to do active learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold classifiers  here .  This was published a year or two ago and I r</p><p>6 0.94345635 <a title="344-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I would like to encourage people to consider giving a tutorial at next years
ICML. The ideal tutorial attracts a wide audience, provides a gentle and
easily taught introduction to the chosen research area, and also covers the
most important contributions in depth.Submissions are due January 14 Â (about
two weeks before paper

<p>Introduction: I second thecall for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI.Severaltimesbefore, details of
why and how to run a workshop have been mentioned.There is a simple reason to
prefer workshops here: attendance. The Helsinki colocation has placed
workshopsdirectly between ICML and COLT/UAI, which is optimal for getting
attendees from any conference. In addition,last year ICML had relatively few
workshopsand NIPS workshops were overloaded. In addition tothose that
happeneda similar number were rejected. The overload has strange consequences
--for example,the best attended workshopwasn't an official NIPS workshop.
Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly
from being off schedule.</p><p>6 0.21055989 <a title="379-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>

before the rest of the workshops in Vancouver, BC. Separate registration is
needed, and open.What's happening fundamentally here is that there are too
many interesting workshops to fit into 2 days. Perhaps we can get it

<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due
January 18, two weeks before papers.Similarly,Ben Taskaris looking for
goodtutorials, which is complementary. Workshops are about exploring a
subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught
essence, a vital part of the research process. Tutorials are due February 13,
two weeks after papers.</p><p>2 0.96739316 <a title="379-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-11-24.html">232 hunch net-2007-02-11-24</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To commemorate theTwenty Fourth Annual International Conference on Machine
Learning(ICML-07), the FOX Network has decided to launch a new spin-off series
in prime time. Through unofficial sources, I have obtained thestory arcfor the
first season, which appears frighteningly realistic.</p><p>3 0.94132233 <a title="379-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-11-18-ICML_2011_%26%238211%3B_Call_for_Tutorials.html">417 hunch net-2010-11-18-ICML 2011 &#8211; Call for Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I would like to encourage people to consider giving a tutorial at next years
ICML. The ideal tutorial attracts a wide audience, provides a gentle and
easily taught introduction to the chosen research area, and also covers the
most important contributions in depth.Submissions are due January 14 Â (about
two weeks before paper
deadline).http://www.icml-2011.org/tutorials.phpRegards,Ulf</p><p>4 0.89274019 <a title="379-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of
the algorit</p><p>5 0.83614075 <a title="379-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-08-Debugging_Your_Brain.html">147 hunch net-2006-01-08-Debugging Your Brain</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One part of doing research is debugging your understanding of reality. This is
hard work: How do you even discover where you misunderstand? If you discover a
misunderstanding, how do you go about removing it?The process of debugging
computer programs is quite analogous to debugging reality misunderstandings.
This is natural--a bug in a computer program is a misunderstanding between you
and the computer about what you said. Many of the familiar techniques from
debugging have exact parallels.DetailsWhen programming, there are often signs
that some bug exists like: "the graph my program output is shifted a little
bit" = maybe you have an indexing error. In debugging yourself, we often have
some impression that something is "not right". These impressions should be
addressed directly and immediately. (Some people have the habit of suppressing
worries in favor of excess certainty. That's not healthy for research.)Corner

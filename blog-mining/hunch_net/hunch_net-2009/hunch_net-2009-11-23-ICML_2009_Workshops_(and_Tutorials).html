<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>2 0.33994627 <a title="379-tfidf-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.

Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>3 0.32377276 <a title="379-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I second the  call for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI .
 
 Several   times   before , details of why and how to run a  workshop have been mentioned.  
 
There is a simple reason to prefer workshops here: attendance.  The Helsinki colocation has placed workshops  directly between ICML and COLT/UAI , which is optimal for getting attendees from any conference.  In addition,  last year ICML had relatively few workshops  and NIPS workshops were overloaded.  In addition to  those that happened  a similar number were rejected.  The overload has strange consequences—for example,  the best attended workshop  wasn’t an official NIPS workshop.  Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly from being off schedule.</p><p>4 0.31883356 <a title="379-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>2 0.88539076 <a title="379-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-17-What_does_Watson_mean%3F.html">424 hunch net-2011-02-17-What does Watson mean?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Watson  convincingly beat the best champion  Jeopardy!  players.  The apparent significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology.  For a random person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire system work.
 
Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed to put together and execute this project—many years of effort by a diverse set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen.  In academia, it’s pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent, and in industry it’s rarely the case that such a capable group has both a worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for several years before success.

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is,  perhaps it’s worthwhile to think about what good research is.   One way to think about good research is in terms of a producer/consumer model.
 
In the producer/consumer model of research, for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new papers or code solving problems).  An produced bit of research is judged as “good” if it is used by many consumers.  There are two basic questions which immediately arise:
  
 Is this a good model of research? 
 Are there alternatives? 
  
The producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially) addressed.
  
  Disconnect.  A group of people doing research on some subject may become disconnected from the rest of the world.  Each person uses the research of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but the group has no impact on the rest of the world.  One way</p><p>4 0.87663186 <a title="379-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By  Shie  and  Nati 
 
Following John’s advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is often the best place for theory papers.  We would like to emphasize that we both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs, and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers.  For many papers, ICML is the best venue.  But for many theory papers, COLT is a better and more appropriate place.
 
Why should you submit to COLT?
 
By-and-large, theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT is more focused then ICML with a single track session.  Unlike ICML, the norm in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks presented.  There is also often a lively discussion followi</p><p>5 0.87114036 <a title="379-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-13-Avoiding_Bad_Reviewing.html">40 hunch net-2005-03-13-Avoiding Bad Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question is “how”?
 
Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good proxy for this question is asking “How can I be a better reviewer?”  Here are a few things I’ve learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a reviewer.
  
 The secret ingredient is careful thought.  There is no good substitution for a deep and careful understanding. 
 Avoid reviewing papers that you feel competitive about.  You almost certainly will be asked to review papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest.  But, the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement. 
 If you feel biased for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing.  For example… 
 Feeling angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias.  See above. 
 Double blind yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation).  The significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close a</p><p>6 0.87053114 <a title="379-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar

<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>5 0.14300734 <a title="345-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic
queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com

<p>Introduction: Nikospointed out thisnew york timesarticle aboutpoor clinical design killing
people. For those of us who study learning from exploration information this
is a reminder that low regret algorithms are particularly important, as regret
in clinical trials is measured by patient deaths.Two obvious improvements on
the experimental design are:With reasonable record keeping of existing
outcomes for the standard treatments, there is no need to explicitly assign
people to a control group with the standard treatment, as that approach is
effectively explored with great certainty. Asserting otherwise would imply
that the nature of effective treatments for cancer has changed between now and
a year ago, which denies the value of any clinical trial.An optimal
experimental design will smoothly phase between exploration and exploitation
as evidence for a new treatment shows that it can be effective. This is old
tech, for example in theEXP3.P algorithm (page 12 aka 59)although I prefer the

<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum

is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a
few things I've learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a
reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind
yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation). The
significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close attention
to a paper. Since</p><p>3 0.96069199 <a title="345-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-24-Mass_Customized_Medicine_in_the_Future%3F.html">314 hunch net-2008-08-24-Mass Customized Medicine in the Future?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.Right now, a
new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or
not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization. The outcome is
observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better
than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a
standard treatment.Generalizing this, a filterFsorts people into two groups:
those for treatmentAand those not for treatmentBbased upon observationsx. To
measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of
groupAand measure the relative performance of the treatment.A problem often
arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated
group. A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad? With respect
to the filterFit may mean that, but with respect to another filterF', the
treatment might be very effective. For example, a drug might work great for

<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over. AAAI
and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing
techniques.Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year. It
seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.For theoretical papers,
with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs. This is very hard to
cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the
authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket "reject" hits many probably-good
papers. Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent
to double blind conferences.On the author side, double blind reviewing is
actually somewhat disruptive to research. In particular, it discourages the
author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of
research. This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously
appreciated.Author feedback: AAAI and ICML did author feedback this year. It
seemed helpful for several pape</p><p>same-blog 6 0.89722049 <a title="345-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-08-Prediction_Science.html">345 hunch net-2009-03-08-Prediction Science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question
is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a
few things I've learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a
reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind
yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation). The
significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close attention
to a paper. Since</p><p>3 0.16233349 <a title="363-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>4 0.15876582 <a title="363-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>5 0.1435592 <a title="363-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-09-ICML_author_feedback_is_open.html">461 hunch net-2012-04-09-ICML author feedback is open</a></p>
<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to

<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal
is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came
to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for
future conference organizers.Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)We
chose to useCMTover other conference management software mainly because of its
rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has
extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.),
good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent
technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).
Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at
that interface sometime soon!Toronto Matching System (TMS)TMSis now being used
by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>4 0.64952683 <a title="363-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-12-Incentive_Compatible_Reviewing.html">207 hunch net-2006-09-12-Incentive Compatible Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reviewing is a fairly formal process which is integral to the way academia is
run. Given this integral nature, the quality of reviewing is often
frustrating. I've seen plenty of examples of false statements, misbeliefs,
reading what isn't written, etcâ&euro;Ś, and I'm sure many other people have as
well.Recently, mechanisms like double blind review and author feedback have
been introduced to try to make the process more fair and accurate in many
machine learning (and related) conferences. My personal experience is that
these mechanisms help, especially the author feedback. Nevertheless, some
problems remain.The game theory take on reviewing is that the incentive for
truthful reviewing isn't there. Since reviewers are also authors, there are
sometimes perverse incentives created and acted upon. (Incidentially, these
incentives can be both positive and negative.)Setting up a truthful reviewing
system is tricky because their is no final reference truth available in any
acceptable (say: subyear)</p><p>5 0.64219129 <a title="363-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-09-ICML_author_feedback_is_open.html">461 hunch net-2012-04-09-ICML author feedback is open</a></p>

higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89308041 <a title="363-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-09-The_Machine_Learning_Forum.html">363 hunch net-2009-07-09-The Machine Learning Forum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Fellow Machine Learners,For the past year or so I have become
increasingly frustrated with the peer review system in our field. I constantly
get asked to review papers in which I have no interest. At the same time, as
an action editor in JMLR, I constantly have to harass people to review papers.
When I send papers to conferences and to journals I often get rejected with
reviews that, at least in my mind, make no sense. Finally, I have a very hard
time keeping up with the best new work, because I don't know where to look for
itâ&euro;ŚI decided to try an do something to improve the situation. I started a new
web site, which I decided to call "The machine learning forum" the URL
ishttp://themachinelearningforum.orgThe main idea behind this web site is to
remove anonymity from the review process. In this site, all opinions are
attributed to the actual person that expressed them. I expect that this will
improve the quality of the reviews. An obvious other effect is that there will
be fewer n</p><p>3 0.84315962 <a title="363-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-19-Machine_learning_reading_groups.html">24 hunch net-2005-02-19-Machine learning reading groups</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereirapoints out a funPrediction Competition. Francisco says:DARPA
is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the
scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the
videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant
with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts,
motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.The
challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant
basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly
interesting:This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably
hard.This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot
deal with.This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and
preprocessed neuroimaging dataset.DARPA is offering prizes!</p><p>5 0.64676619 <a title="363-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-08-Online_Learning_as_the_Mathematics_of_Accountability.html">109 hunch net-2005-09-08-Online Learning as the Mathematics of Accountability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

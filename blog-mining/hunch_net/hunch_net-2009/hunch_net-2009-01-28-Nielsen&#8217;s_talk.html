<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own

<p>Introduction: In the AI-related parts of machine learning, it is often tempting to examine
howyoudo things in order to imagine how a machine should do things. This is
introspection, and it can easily go awry. I will call introspection gone awry
introspectionism.Introspectionism is almost unique to AI (and the AI-related
parts of machine learning) and it can lead to huge wasted effort in research.
It's easiest to show how introspectionism arises by an example.Suppose we want
to solve the problem of navigating a robot from point A to point B given a
camera. Then, the following research action plan might seem natural when you
examine your own capabilities:Build an edge detector for still images.Build an
object recognition system given the edge detector.Build a system to predict
distance and orientation to objects given the object recognition system.Build
a system to plan a path through the scene you construct from {object
identification, distance, orientation} predictions.As you execute the above,

<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation
and theoretical understanding.MethodK-fold cross validation is a commonly used
technique which takes a set ofmexamples and partitions them intoKsets
("folds") of sizem/K. For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other
folds and then test on the fold.ProblemAssume only independent samples. Derive
a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error
rate.Past Work(I'll add more as I remember/learn.)Devroye, Rogers, and Wagner
analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds. Not all of this
is online, but here is onepaper.Michael KearnsandDana Ronanalyzed cross
validationand found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for
the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test
set of sizem/K.Avrim Blum,Adam Kalai, andmyselfanalyzed cross validationand

<p>Introduction: Larry Jackal has set up theLAGR("Learning Applied to Ground Robotics") project
(and competition) which seems to be quite well designed. Features include:Many
participants (8 going on 12?)Standardized hardware. In theDARPA grand
challengecontestants entering with motorcycles are at a severe disadvantage to
those entering with a Hummer. Similarly, contestants using more powerful
sensors can gain huge advantages.Monthly contests, with full feedback (but
since the hardware is standardized, only code is shipped). One of the premises
of the program is that robust systems are desired. Monthly evaluations at
different locations can help measure this and provide data.Attacks a known

<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost
exclusively about new research, rather than evaluation (and consideration) of
research directions. This last role is satisfied by funding agencies to some
extent, but that is a private debate of</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="340-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-Holy_grails_of_machine_learning%3F.html">2 hunch net-2005-01-24-Holy grails of machine learning?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: from brain cancer.  I asked  Misha  who worked with him to write about it. 
  
Partha Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43. 
 
I first met Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation. I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus fo</p><p>3 0.15772936 <a title="357-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-10-Conferences%2C_Dates%2C_Locations.html">17 hunch net-2005-02-10-Conferences, Dates, Locations</a></p>

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>4 0.15693134 <a title="357-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-15-IJCAI_is_out_of_season.html">184 hunch net-2006-06-15-IJCAI is out of season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IJCAI  is running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian summer.)
 
The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are particularly inconvenient if you attend  COLT  or  ICML .

<p>Introduction: There are several summer schools related to machine learning.
 
We are running a two week  machine learning summer school  in Chicago, USA May 16-27.  
 
IPAM is running a more focused three week summer school on  Intelligent Extraction of Information from Graphs and High Dimensional Data  in Los Angeles, USA July 11-29.

<p>Introduction: There will be two  machine learning summer schools  in 2006.  
 
One is in  Canberra, Australia  from February 6 to February 17 (Aussie summer).  The webpage is fully ‘live’ so you should actively consider it now.
 
The other is in  Taipei, Taiwan  from July 24 to August 4.  This one is still in the planning phase, but that should be settled soon.  
 
Attending an MLSS is probably the quickest and easiest way to bootstrap yourself into a reasonable initial understanding of the field of machine learning.</p><p>5 0.61255068 <a title="357-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-28-Running_A_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">75 hunch net-2005-05-28-Running A Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just finished the  Chicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School .  The school was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.   For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previous  MLSS s have been close).  Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on this.  For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian friends.  Email  Mrs Spela Sitar  of the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details. 
 
The following are some notes for future planning and those interested.

<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon  points out  AIStats 2011  in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  The  call for papers  is now out, due Nov. 1.  The plan is to  experiment with the review process  to encourage quality in several ways.  I expect to submit a paper and would encourage others with good research to do likewise.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.76124531 <a title="357-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-30-Many_ways_to_Learn_this_summer.html">357 hunch net-2009-05-30-Many ways to Learn this summer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are at least  3  summer schools related to machine learning this summer.
  
  The first  is at  University of Chicago  June 1-11 organized by  Misha Belkin ,  Partha Niyogi , and   Steve Smale .  Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met their capacity limit.  The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.  I was particularly interested to see  Valiant  amongst the speakers.  I’m also presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction. 
  Praveen Srinivasan  points out the second at  Peking University  in Beijing, China, July 20-27.   This one  differs substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning, and their intersection.  The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15.  This is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active support from  NSF . 
 The third one is at  Cambridge , England, August 29-September 10.  It’s in the  MLSS series .  Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about the Bayesian side of ML, alth</p><p>3 0.69297057 <a title="357-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Problem%3A_Online_Learning.html">28 hunch net-2005-02-25-Problem: Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Despite my best intentions, this is not a fully specified problem, but rather a research direction.  
 
Competitive online learning is one of the more compelling pieces of learning theory because typical statements of the form “this algorithm will perform almost as well as a large set of other algorithms” rely only on fully-observable quantities, and are therefore applicable in many situations.  Examples include  Winnow ,  Weighted Majority , and  Binomial Weighting .  Algorithms with this property haven’t taken over the world yet.  Here might be some reasons:
  
  Lack of caring .  Many people working on learning theory don’t care about particular applications much.  This means constants in the algorithm are not optimized, usable code is often not produced, and empirical studies aren’t done. 
  Inefficiency . Viewed from the perspective of other learning algorithms, online learning is terribly inefficient.  It requires that every hypothesis (called an expert in the online learning set</p><p>4 0.56067026 <a title="357-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-19-Why_I_decided_to_run_a_weblog..html">1 hunch net-2005-01-19-Why I decided to run a weblog.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory research.  Here are some reasons:
 
1) Weblogs enable new functionality:
  
 Public comment on papers.  No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most journals.  I have encountered it once for a  science  paper.   Some communities have mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory.  I have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to consider other’s questions and read the replies. 
 Conference shortlists.  One of the most common conversations at a conference is “what did you find interesting?”  There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at conferences, and it’s easy to imagine that it would be handy to do so. 
 Evaluation and comment on research directions.  Papers are almost exclusively about new research, rather than evaluation (and consideration) of research directions.  This last role is satisfied by funding agencies to some extent, but</p><p>5 0.49545079 <a title="357-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a quick reference for summer ML-related conferences sorted by due date:
  
 
 Conference 
 Due date 
 Location 
 Reviewing 
 
 
  KDD  
 Feb 10 
 August 12-16, Beijing, China 
 Single Blind 
 
 
  COLT  
 Feb 14 
 June 25-June 27, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Single Blind? (historically) 
 
 
  ICML  
 Feb 24 
 June 26-July 1, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Double Blind, author response, zero  SPOF  
 
 
  UAI  
 March 30 
 August 15-17, Catalina Islands, California 
 Double Blind, author response 
 
  
Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>6 0.48847839 <a title="357-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

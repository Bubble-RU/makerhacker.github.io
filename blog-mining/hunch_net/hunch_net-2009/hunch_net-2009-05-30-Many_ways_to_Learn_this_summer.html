<p>Introduction: I'm visiting Beijing for thePao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conferenceon Machine
Learning.I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research. Given
the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research--more
than has been observed at international conferences. The fundamental problem
seems to be theCultural Revolutionwhich lobotimized higher education, and the
research associated with it. There has been a process of slow recovery since
then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased
participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.The
amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive--people
are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel
I'm staying at (and this is not unusual). If a small fraction of this effort
is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very
substantial. General growth in China's research portfolio should be expected.</p><p>3 0.16483083 <a title="357-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-15-IJCAI_is_out_of_season.html">184 hunch net-2006-06-15-IJCAI is out of season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>4 0.13920307 <a title="357-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-07-17-MUCMD_and_BayLearn.html">470 hunch net-2012-07-17-MUCMD and BayLearn</a></p>

author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.KDD is notable for being
the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels,
Papers (two tracks), Demos}. The S for KDD is because there is sometimes
author feedback at the decision of the SPC.The (past) January 18 deadline for

<p>Introduction: We just finished theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School. The school
was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.
For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning
class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previousMLSSs have been close).
Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on
this. For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian
friends. EmailMrs Spela Sitarof the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details.The
following are some notes for future planning and those interested.Good

House. Our attendance came in well above our expectations, so this was a
critical early decision that made a huge difference.The invited speakers were
key. They made a huge difference in the quality of the content.Delegating

<p>Introduction: There are at least3summer schools related to machine learning this summer.The
firstis atUniversity of ChicagoJune 1-11 organized byMisha Belkin,Partha
Niyogi, andSteve Smale. Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met
their capacity limit. The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.
I was particularly interested to seeValiantamongst the speakers. I'm also
presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction.Praveen
Srinivasanpoints out the second atPeking Universityin Beijing, China, July
20-27.This onediffers substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning,
and their intersection. The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15. This
is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active
support fromNSF.The third one is atCambridge, England, August 29-September 10.
It's in theMLSS series. Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about
the Bayesian side of ML, although effort has been made to create a good cross
section of topic</p><p>4 0.7687149 <a title="357-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-02-The_Machine_Learning_Award_goes_to_%26%238230%3B.html">270 hunch net-2007-11-02-The Machine Learning Award goes to &#8230;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is theTuring Award, which has a
$0.25M cash prize associated with it. It appears none of the prizes so far
have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database
awards).In CS theory, there is theGÃƒÂ¶del Prizewhich is smaller and newer,
offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition. One
such award has been given for Machine Learning, toRobert SchapireandYoav
Freundfor Adaboost.In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of
these sorts of prizes. There are several plausible reasons for this:There is
no coherent community.People drift in and out of the central conferences all
the time. Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the
conferences of today. In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new.There
are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.Machine Learning
work doesn't lastAlmost every paper is forgotten, because {the goals change,

<p>Introduction: It's reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level)
the sorts of problems which I see in papers. Hopefully, this will help us all
write better papers.The following flaws are fatal to any paper:Incorrect
theorem or lemma statementsA typo might be "ok", if it can be understood. Any
theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be
rejected. Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference. A
paper rejected for this reason must be fixed.Lack of UnderstandingIf a paper
is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected
for the same reason. This is more controversial than it sounds because there
are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the
reviewer. The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with
me).As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons. This is why an
anonymizedcommunication channelwith the author can be very helpful.Bad

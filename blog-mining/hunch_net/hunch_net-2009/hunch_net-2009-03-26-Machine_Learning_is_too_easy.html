<p>Introduction: There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes. Many classes
are of the 'zoo' sort: many different learning algorithms are presented.
Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning.This
is my view of what makes a good machine learning class, along with why. I'd
like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing,
misemphasized, or misplaced.PhaseSubjectWhy?IntroductionWhat is a machine
learning problem?A good understanding of the characteristics of machine
learning problems seems essential. Characteristics include: a data source,
some hope the data is predictive, and a need for generalization. This is
probably best taught in a case study manner: lay out the specifics of some
problem and then ask "Is this a machine learning problem?"IntroductionMachine

<p>Introduction: Muthuinvited me to the workshop onalgorithms in the field, with the goal of
providing a sense of where near-term research should go. When the time came
though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other
people to comment.There are several things I didn't fully understand when I
went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago. I'd like to repeat them as people in
academia may not yet understand them intuitively.Almost all the big impact
algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time. Think about caching,
hashing, sorting, filtering, etcâ&euro;Ś and you have a sense of what some of the
most heavily used algorithms are. This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning
research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and
languages. Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where
inference is often a superlinear operation--think about then2dependence on the

<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>6 0.16288686 <a title="347-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Machine learning has a new kind of "scaling to larger problems" to worry
about: scaling with the amount of contextual information. The standard
development path for a machine learning application in practice seems to be
the following:Marginal. In the beginning, there was "majority vote". At this
stage, it isn't necessary to understand that you have a prediction problem.
People just realize that one answer is right sometimes and another answer
other times. In machine learning terms, this corresponds to making a
prediction without side information.First context. A clever person realizes
that some bit of informationx1could be helpful. Ifx1is discrete, they
condition on it and make a predictorh(x1), typically by counting. If they are
clever, then they also do some smoothing. Ifx1is some real valued parameter,
it's very common to make a threshold cutoff. Often, these tasks are simply
done by hand.Second. Another clever person (or perhaps the same one) realizes
that some other bit of informa</p><p>5 0.77026087 <a title="347-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started theRLBench projectto setup a
suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We haven't been able to
touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold. Luckily,
there are several other projects such asCLSquareandRL-Gluewith a similar goal,
and we strongly endorse their continued development.I would like to explain
why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks. For
example, sometimes theUCI Machine Learning Repositoryis criticized. There are
two criticisms I know of:Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in
the repository. It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening
unintentionally. Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning
algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very
badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems. I
have seen little evidence of this but it remains a point of concern. There is

<p>Introduction: Watsonconvincingly beat the best championJeopardy!players. The apparent
significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge
about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology. For a random
person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for
people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good
assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire
system work.Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed
to put together and execute this project--many years of effort by a diverse
set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen. In academia,
it's pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent,
and in industry it's rarely the case that such a capable group has both a
worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for
several years before success.Alinainvited me to the Jeopardy watching party

<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>3 0.91999418 <a title="347-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>4 0.91957545 <a title="347-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-14-Clever_Methods_of_Overfitting.html">19 hunch net-2005-02-14-Clever Methods of Overfitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Overfitting" is traditionally defined as training some flexible
representation so that it memorizes the data but fails to predict well in the
future. For this post, I will define overfitting more generally as over-
representing the performance of systems. There are two styles of general
overfitting: overrepresenting performance on particular datasets and
(implicitly) overrepresenting performance of a method on future datasets.We
should all be aware of these methods, avoid them where possible, and take them
into account otherwise. I have used "reproblem" and "old datasets", and may
have participated in "overfitting by review"--some of these are very difficult
to avoid.NameMethodExplanationRemedyTraditional overfittingTrain a complex

<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>6 0.91583073 <a title="347-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>

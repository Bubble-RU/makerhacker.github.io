<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.

<p>Introduction: Muthu  invited me to the workshop on  algorithms in the field , with the goal of providing a sense of where near-term research should go.  When the time came though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other people to comment.
 
There are several things I didn’t fully understand when I went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago.  I’d like to repeat them as people in academia may not yet understand them intuitively.
  
 Almost all the big impact algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time.  Think about caching, hashing, sorting, filtering, etc… and you have a sense of what some of the most heavily used algorithms are.  This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and languages.  Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where inference is often a superlinear operation—think about the  n 2   dependence on the number of states in a  Hidden Markov Model  and Kernelized  Support Vecto</p><p>4 0.15745771 <a title="347-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory in machine learning is “only useful for getting papers published”.  That’s a compelling statement, as I’ve seen many papers where the algorithm clearly came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a perceived means to improve the chance of publication. 
 
Naturally, I disagree and believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.  
 
Even in core learning algorithm design, I’ve found learning theory to be useful, although it’s application is more subtle than many realize.  The most straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*).  In my experience, considering learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in practice:
  
 It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense.  The best example</p><p>5 0.1550283 <a title="347-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the “right” way to do machine learning.  This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.  The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a reply 2 .
 
The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and general.  Essentially, you first specify a prior  P(D)  over possible processes  D  producing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:   P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)   
After this, hard decisions are made (such as “turn left” or “turn right”) by choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior) loss.
 
This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices of  P(D)  and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice properties:
  
 There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual distribution generating the data is drawn from  P(D)  there is no better method.</p><p>6 0.15469791 <a title="347-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes.  Many classes are of the ‘zoo’ sort: many different learning algorithms are presented.  Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning.  
 
This is my view of what makes a good machine learning class, along with why.  I’d like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing, misemphasized, or misplaced.

 Introduction 
 What is a machine learning problem? 
 A good understanding of the characteristics of machine learning problems seems essential.  Characteristics include: a data source, some hope the data is predictive, and a need for generalization.  This is probably best taught in a case study manner: lay out the specifics of some problem and then ask “Is this a machine learning problem?”

<p>Introduction: Foster Provost  gave a talk at the ICML  metalearning workshop  on “metalearning” and the “no free lunch theorem” which seems worth summarizing.
 
As a review: the no free lunch theorem is the most complicated way we know of to say that a  bias  is required in order to learn.  The simplest way to see this is in a nonprobabilistic setting.  If you are given examples of the form  (x,y)  and you wish to predict  y  from  x  then any prediction mechanism errs half the time in expectation over all sequences of examples.  The proof of this is very simple: on every example a predictor must make some prediction and by symmetry over the set of sequences it will be wrong half the time and right half the time.  The basic idea of this proof has been applied to many other settings.
 
The simplistic interpretation of this theorem which many people jump to is “machine learning is dead” since there can be no single learning algorithm which can solve all learning problems.  This is the wrong way to thi</p><p>5 0.79079896 <a title="347-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started the  RLBench project  to setup a suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems.  We haven’t been able to touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold.  Luckily, there are several other projects such as  CLSquare  and  RL-Glue  with a similar goal, and we strongly endorse their continued development.
 
I would like to explain why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks.   For example, sometimes the  UCI Machine Learning Repository  is criticized.  There are two criticisms I know of:
  
 Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in the repository.  It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening unintentionally.  Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems.  I have seen little evidence of this but it remains a po</p><p>6 0.77953649 <a title="347-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-02-Thoughts_regarding_%26%238220%3BIs_machine_learning_different_from_statistics%3F%26%238221%3B.html">230 hunch net-2007-02-02-Thoughts regarding &#8220;Is machine learning different from statistics?&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pieter Abbeel  presented a paper with  Andrew Ng  at  ICML  on  Exploration and Apprenticeship Learning in Reinforcement Learning .  The basic idea of this algorithm is:
  
 Collect data from a human controlling a machine. 
 Build a transition model based upon the experience. 
 Build a policy which optimizes the transition model. 
 Evaluate the policy.  If it works well, halt, otherwise add the experience into the pool and go to (2). 
  
The paper proves that this technique will converge to some policy with expected performance near human expected performance assuming the  world fits certain assumptions (MDP or linear dynamics).  
 
This general idea of apprenticeship learning (i.e. incorporating data from an expert) seems very compelling because (a) humans often learn this way and (b) much harder problems can be solved.   For (a), the notion of teaching is about transferring knowledge from an expert to novices, often via demonstration. To see (b), note that we can create intricate rei</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93402141 <a title="347-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-26-Machine_Learning_is_too_easy.html">347 hunch net-2009-03-26-Machine Learning is too easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is.  The viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.
 
There are two fundamental reasons why this is possible.
  
 For many problems, many approaches work in the sense that they do something useful.  This is true empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor.  It’s also true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples. 
 There is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field.  In many other areas there</p><p>3 0.93375605 <a title="347-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-19-Cool_and_interesting_things_seen_at_NIPS.html">279 hunch net-2007-12-19-Cool and interesting things seen at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things at  NIPS .
  
 The financial people were there in greater force than previously.   Two Sigma  sponsored NIPS while  DRW Trading  had a booth. 
 The  adversarial machine learning workshop  had a number of talks about interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up your learning algorithm.  This is very different from the situation we often think of where the world is oblivious to our learning.  This may present new and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common at  COLT . 
 There were several interesing papers.
 
  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Daniel Hsu , and  Claire Monteleoni  had a paper on  General Agnostic Active Learning .  The basic idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised learning problem.  This is great, because we have many supervised learning algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.

<p>Introduction: Muthu  invited me to the workshop on  algorithms in the field , with the goal of providing a sense of where near-term research should go.  When the time came though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other people to comment.
 
There are several things I didn’t fully understand when I went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago.  I’d like to repeat them as people in academia may not yet understand them intuitively.
  
 Almost all the big impact algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time.  Think about caching, hashing, sorting, filtering, etc… and you have a sense of what some of the most heavily used algorithms are.  This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and languages.  Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where inference is often a superlinear operation—think about the  n 2   dependence on the number of states in a  Hidden Markov Model  and Kernelized  Support Vecto</p><p>5 0.87846792 <a title="347-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-07-NYU_Large_Scale_Machine_Learning_Class.html">478 hunch net-2013-01-07-NYU Large Scale Machine Learning Class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yann LeCun  and I are coteaching a class on  Large Scale Machine Learning  starting late January  at NYU .  This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the previous.
 
This is not a beginning class—you really need to have taken a basic machine learning class previously to follow along.  Students will be able to run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms since  Yahoo!  has donated servers which are being configured into a small scale  Hadoop  cluster.   We are planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so good class projects could easily lead to papers.
 
For me, this is a chance to teach on many topics of past research.  In general, it seems like researchers should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of teachability and to see their own research through th</p><p>6 0.87784398 <a title="347-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>

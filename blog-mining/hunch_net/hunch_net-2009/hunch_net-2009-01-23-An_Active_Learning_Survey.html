<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attending  ICML , except for  Dora  who arrived on Monday.  Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is going well.
 
For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like everyone),  Mark Reid  has setup the  ICML discussion  site where you can comment on any paper or subscribe to papers.  Authors are automatically subscribed to their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly after the fact, as people desire.
 
We also conducted a survey before the conference and have the  survey results  now.  This can be compared with the  ICML 2010 survey results .  Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4 being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and 2010.
 
Glancing through them, I see:

<p>Introduction: At NIPS,  Andrew Ng  asked me what should be in a large scale learning class.  After some discussion with him and  Nando  and mulling it over a bit, these are the topics that I think should be covered.
 
There are many different kinds of scaling.
  
  Scaling in examples   This is the most basic kind of scaling.
 
  Online Gradient Descent  This is an old algorithm—I’m not sure if anyone can be credited with it in particular.  Perhaps the  Perceptron  is a good precursor, but substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of which  squared loss ,  logistic loss , Hinge Loss, and  Quantile Loss  are all worth covering.  It’s important to cover the  semantics  of these loss functions as well.   Vowpal Wabbit  is a reasonably fast codebase implementing these. 
  Second Order Gradient Descent methods  For some problems, methods taking into account second derivative information can be more effective.  I’ve seen preconditioned conjugate gradient work well, for which  Jonath</p><p>4 0.072569959 <a title="338-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most at  ICML  and  COLT  2010 were:
  
  Thomas Walsh ,  Kaushik Subramanian ,  Michael Littman  and  Carlos Diuk   Generalizing Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes .  This paper formalizes and provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that perform better than for either setting alone. 
  István Szita  and  Csaba Szepesvári   Model-based reinforcement learning with nearly tight exploration complexity bounds .  This paper and  another represent the frontier of best-known algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process. 
  James Martens   Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization .  About a new not-quite-online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional structures.  Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made since  Sanjoy  pointed out the significant  lack of theoretical understanding of active learning .  This is an update on the progress I know of.  As a refresher, active learning as meant here is:
  
 There is a source of unlabeled data. 
 There is an oracle from which labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source. 
 The goal is to perform well with minimal use of the oracle. 
  
Here is what I’ve learned:
  
 Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for active learning given the assumptions of IID data and “realizability” (that one of the classifiers is a correct classifier). 
  Nina ,  Alina , and I developed an algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data.  A draft is  here .

<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,  Sanjoy   made a post  saying roughly “we should  study active learning theoretically, because not much is understood”.   
 
At the time, we did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the noise rate.  In other words, the fundamental question was “can we do it?”
 
The nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind.   The answer is to the previous question is “yes”, both information theoretically and computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.  
 
In many situation, the question has now changed to: “is it worth it?”  Is the programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost savings of active learning worthwhile?  Currently, there are situations where this question could go either way.  Much of the challenge for the future is in figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.</p><p>4 0.50270158 <a title="338-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-20-The_End_of_the_Beginning_of_Active_Learning.html">432 hunch net-2011-04-20-The End of the Beginning of Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>5 0.35793838 <a title="338-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-15-Interesting_papers_at_COLT_%28and_a_bit_of_UAI_%26%23038%3B_workshops%29.html">310 hunch net-2008-07-15-Interesting papers at COLT (and a bit of UAI &#038; workshops)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers from  COLT 2008  that I found interesting.
  
  Maria-Florina Balcan ,  Steve Hanneke , and  Jenn Wortman ,  The True Sample Complexity of Active Learning .  This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning is  always  better than supervised learning (although the gap may be small).  This is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us knowing how to do it properly. 
  Nir Ailon  and  Mehryar Mohri ,  An Efficient Reduction of Ranking to Classification .  This paper shows how to robustly rank  n  objects with  n log(n)  classifications using a quicksort based algorithm.  The result is applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for others. 
  Michael Kearns  and  Jennifer Wortman .  Learning from Collective Behavior .  This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a collection of interacting agents behave.

The set of allowed html tags has been increased and the  markdown filter  has been put in place to try to make commenting easier.

<p>Introduction: Today brings a new release of the  Vowpal Wabbit  fast online learning software.  This time, unlike the previous release, the project itself is going open source, developing via  github .  For example, the lastest and greatest can be downloaded via:
  
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
  
If you aren’t familiar with  git , it’s a distributed version control system which supports quick and easy branching, as well as reconciliation.
 
This version of the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of OSX as well as Linux boxes.
 
As much of the point of this project is pushing the limits of fast and effective machine learning, let me mention a few datapoints from my experience.
  
 The program can effectively scale up to batch-style training on sparse terafeature (i.e. 10 12  sparse feature) size datasets.  The limiting factor is typically i/o. 
 I started using the the real datasets from the  large-scale learning  workshop as a conve</p><p>5 0.42207664 <a title="338-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-08-Fast_Physics_for_Learning.html">37 hunch net-2005-03-08-Fast Physics for Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this discussion about a  fast physics simulator  chip interesting from a learning viewpoint.  In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical processes.  Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite helpful in predicting the outcome.  Bayesian learning in particular may directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines) might have their speed greatly increased.
 
The biggest drawback is that writing software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming, but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.35567796 <a title="338-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-19-Loss_Functions_for_Discriminative_Training_of_Energy-Based_Models.html">23 hunch net-2005-02-19-Loss Functions for Discriminative Training of Energy-Based Models</a></p>

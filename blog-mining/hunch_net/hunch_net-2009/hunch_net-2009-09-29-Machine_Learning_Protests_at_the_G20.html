<p>Introduction: Weâ&euro;&trade;d like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop on kernel learning.  While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression, classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be considered. The deadline for submissions is  October 24 .
 
More detail can be found  here .

<p>Introduction: Carnegie Mellon   School of Computer Science  has the first academic  Machine Learning department .  This department already existed as the  Center for Automated Learning and Discovery , but recently changed it’s name.  
 
The reason for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as “Automated Learner and Discoverers”, but there are number of people who think of themselves as “Machine Learners”.  Machine learning is both more succinct and recognizable—good properties for a name.
 
A more interesting question is “Should there be a Machine Learning Department?”.    Tom Mitchell  has a relevant  whitepaper  claiming that machine learning  is answering a different question than other fields or departments.  The fundamental debate here is “Is machine learning different from statistics?”

<p>Introduction: The  results have been posted , with  CMU first ,  Stanford second , and  Virginia Tech Third .
 
Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

<p>Introduction: The DARPA grandchallenge is a big contest for autonomous robot vehicle driving.  It was run once in 2004 for the first time and all teams did badly.  This year was notably different with the  Stanford  and  CMU  teams succesfully completing the course.  A number of details are  here  and  wikipedia has continuing coverage .
 
A formal winner hasnâ&euro;&trade;t been declared yet although Stanford completed the course quickest.  
 
The Stanford and CMU teams deserve a large round of applause as they have strongly demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous vehicles.
 
The good news for machine learning is that the Stanford team (at least) is using some machine learning techniques.</p><p>3 0.5398246 <a title="372-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-18-Radford_Neal_starts_a_blog.html">313 hunch net-2008-08-18-Radford Neal starts a blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My impression is that this is a particularly strong year for machine learning graduates.  Here’s my short list of the strong graduates I know.  Analpha (for perversity’s sake) by last name:
  
  Jenn Wortmann . When Jenn visited us for the summer, she had  one ,  two ,  three ,  four  papers.  That is typical—she’s smart, capable, and follows up many directions of research.  I believe approximately all of her many papers are on different subjects. 
  Ruslan Salakhutdinov . A  Science paper on bijective dimensionality reduction , mastered and improved on deep belief nets which seems like an important flavor of nonlinear learning, and in my experience he’s very fast, capable and creative at problem solving. 
  Marc’Aurelio Ranzato .  I haven’t spoken with Marc very much, but he had a great visit at Yahoo! this summer, and has an impressive portfolio of applications and improvements on convolutional neural networks and other deep learning algorithms.

<p>Introduction: Although I’m greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in reviews.  The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if the  Byzantine generals  limit has been exceeded.  For example, I’ve seen recent reviews where the given reasons for rejecting are:
  
 [ NIPS ] Theorem A is uninteresting because Theorem B is uninteresting. 
 [ UAI ] When you learn by memorization, the problem addressed is trivial. 
 [NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.  
 [NIPS] This has been done before.  (… but not giving any relevant citations)  
  
Just for the record I want to point out what’s wrong with these reviews.  A future world in which such reasons never come up again would be great, but I’m sure these errors will be committed many times more in the future.
  
 This is nonsense.  A theorem should be evaluated based on it’s merits, rather than the merits of another theorem. 
 Learning by memorization requires an expon</p><p>4 0.1837655 <a title="372-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

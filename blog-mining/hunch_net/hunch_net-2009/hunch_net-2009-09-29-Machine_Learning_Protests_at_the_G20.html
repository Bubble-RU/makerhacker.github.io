<p>Introduction: Carnegie MellonSchool of Computer Sciencehas the first academicMachine
Learning department. This department already existed as theCenter for
Automated Learning and Discovery, but recently changed it's name.The reason
for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as
"Automated Learner and Discoverers", but there are number of people who think
of themselves as "Machine Learners". Machine learning is both more succinct
and recognizable--good properties for a name.A more interesting question is
"Should there be a Machine Learning Department?".Tom Mitchellhas a
relevantwhitepaperclaiming that machine learning is answering a different
question than other fields or departments. The fundamental debate here is "Is
machine learning different from statistics?"At a cultural level, there is no
real debate: they are different. Machine learning is characterized by several
very active large peer reviewed conferences, operating in a computer science
mode. Statistics tends to fun</p><p>3 0.11865486 <a title="372-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.094137393 <a title="372-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then
it has probability ab</p><p>4 0.48067164 <a title="372-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate_Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning.html">302 hunch net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate Mathematics for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction
between:Anopen setand aclosed set.ASupremumand aMaximum.An event which happens
with probability 1 and an event that always happens.I don't appreciate this
distinction in machine learning & learning theory. All machine learning takes
place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.
Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and
probability 1 events always happen.The fundamental issue here is that
substantial parts of mathematics don't appear well-matched to computation in
the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.
This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions. We can ask "what
mathematics is appropriate to computation?"Andrejhas convinced me that a
pretty good answer to this question isconstructive mathematics.So, here's a
basic challenge: Can anyone name a situation where any of the distinctions

<p>Introduction: The Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition is about to get started.
The aim of the competition is to facilitate direct comparisons between various
learning methods on important and realistic domains. This year's event will
feature well-known benchmark domains as well as more challenging problems of
real-world complexity, such as helicopter control and robot soccer
keepaway.The competition begins on November 1st, 2007 when training software
is released. Results must be submitted by July 1st, 2008. The competition will
culminate in an event at ICML-08 in Helsinki, Finland, at which the winners
will be announced.For more information, visitthe competition website.</p><p>6 0.43627015 <a title="372-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-15-The_Machine_Learning_Department.html">228 hunch net-2007-01-15-The Machine Learning Department</a></p>

particular:The locations of specific objects are provided by the data.The data
collection is far more complete and extensive.The data consists of:The source
images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.)The in-game events. (1

<p>Introduction: Some of the "sister conference" presentations atAAAIhave been great. Roughly
speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come
give a summary of their conference. Many different AI-related conferences
accepted. The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of
the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked. This is
great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work
of several thousand researchers--something which is simply available nowhere
else.Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant
component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning inAIIDE,IUI,
andACL.There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event
similar toFCRC, but centered on AI & Learning. This seems like a fine idea.
The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of
a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>4 0.030320546 <a title="372-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Watchword%3A_Probability.html">5 hunch net-2005-01-26-Watchword: Probability</a></p>

some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then
it has probability ab</p><p>5 0.0 <a title="372-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-19-Why_I_decided_to_run_a_weblog..html">1 hunch net-2005-01-19-Why I decided to run a weblog.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost
exclusively about new research, rather than evaluation (and consideration) of
research directions. This last role is satisfied by funding agencies to some
extent, but that is a private debate of</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="372-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-Holy_grails_of_machine_learning%3F.html">2 hunch net-2005-01-24-Holy grails of machine learning?</a></p>

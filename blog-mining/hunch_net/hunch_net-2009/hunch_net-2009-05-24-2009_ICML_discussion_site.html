dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.Machine Learning conferences
are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

Last year's attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.The primary
experiment forICML 2013is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling
review cycles. The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15. This
is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and
reduce peak load. The "not for proceedings" experiment from this year's ICML
is not continuing.Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>6 0.11680508 <a title="356-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-06-20-2010_ICML_discussion_site.html">401 hunch net-2010-06-20-2010 ICML discussion site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Everyone should have received notice forNY ML Symposiumabstracts. Check
carefully, as one was lost by our system.The event itself is October 21, next
week.Leon Bottou,Stephen Boyd, andYoav Freundare giving the invited talks this
year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the
day.Chris Wigginshas setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the
symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment
interested.I also wanted to give an update onICML 2012. Unlike last year, our
deadline is coordinated withAIStat(which is due this Friday). The paper
deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow
significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break. Other details
may interest people as well:We settled on usingCMTafter checking out the
possibilities. I wasn't looking for this, because I've often found CMT clunky
in terms of easy access to the right information. Nevertheless, the breadth of

<p>Introduction: Alex Smolashowed me thisICML 2006webpage. This isNOTthe ICML we know, but
rather some people at "Enformatika". Investigation shows that they registered
with an anonymous yahoo email account fromdotregistrar.comthe "Home of the
$6.79 wholesale domain!" and their nameservers are byTurkticaret, a Turkish
internet company.It appears the website has since been altered to "ICNL" (the
above link uses the google cache).They say that imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, so the organizers of the realICML 2006must feel quite
flattered.</p><p>6 0.49423757 <a title="356-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-24-ICML_2012_videos_lost.html">487 hunch net-2013-07-24-ICML 2012 videos lost</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>4 0.44795871 <a title="356-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: We just finished theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School. The school
was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.
For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning
class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previousMLSSs have been close).
Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on
this. For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian

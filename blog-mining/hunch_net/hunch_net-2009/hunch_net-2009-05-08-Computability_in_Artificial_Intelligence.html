<p>Introduction: I’ve enjoyed the  Terminator  movies and show.  Neglecting the whacky aspects (time travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion: how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?
 
In Terminator-land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent them from being made.  This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on building an intelligent machine keeps coming up.  This is partly a ploy for writer’s to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron.

<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>2 0.98071319 <a title="353-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-18-Lower_Bounds_for_Learning_Reductions.html">83 hunch net-2005-06-18-Lower Bounds for Learning Reductions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Learning reductions  transform a solver of one type of learning problem into a solver of another type of learning problem.  When we analyze these for robustness we can make statement of the form “Reduction  R  has the property that regret  r  (or loss) on subproblems of type  A  implies regret at most   f ( r )  on the original problem of type  B “.
 
A lower bound for a learning reduction would have the form “for all reductions  R , there exists a learning problem of type  B  and learning algorithm for problems of type  A  where regret  r  on induced problems implies  at least  regret  f ( r )  for  B “.
 
The pursuit of lower bounds is often questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical algorithms.  Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about what is learnable and how learnable it is.  This has already come up  here  and  here .
 
At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for learning reductions, and we have little understa</p><p>3 0.98027283 <a title="353-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-27-Key_Scientific_Challenges.html">339 hunch net-2009-01-27-Key Scientific Challenges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>4 0.96850139 <a title="353-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-06-Bounds_greater_than_1.html">170 hunch net-2006-04-06-Bounds greater than 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nati Srebro  and  Shai Ben-David  have a  paper  at  COLT  which, in the appendix, proves something very striking: several previous error bounds are  always  greater than 1.
 
 Background  One branch of learning theory focuses on theorems which
  
 Assume samples are drawn IID from an unknown distribution  D . 
 Fix a set of classifiers 
 Find a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with respect to  D ) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training set.
 
  
Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.

 
 Current  Everyone working on this subject wants “tighter bounds”, however there are different definitions of “tighter”.  Some groups focus on “functional tightness” (getting the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a parameterization of the hypothesis space) while  others  focus on “practical tightness” (finding bounds which work well on practical problems).  (I am definitely in the second camp.)

<p>Introduction: The New York Times had a  short interview  about machine learning in datamining being used pervasively by the IRS and large corporations to predict who to audit and who to target for various marketing campaigns.  This is a big application area of machine learning.  It can be harmful (learning + databases = another way to invade privacy) or beneficial (as google demonstrates, better targeting of marketing campaigns is far less annoying).  This is yet more evidence that we can not rely upon “I’m just another fish in the school” logic for our expectations about treatment by government and large corporations.</p><p>6 0.94997156 <a title="353-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">488 hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>

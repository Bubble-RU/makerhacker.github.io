<p>Introduction: Dan Reevesintroduced me toMichael Vassarwho ran theSingularity Summitand
educated me a bit on the subject of AI safety which theSingularity
Institutehassmall grants for.I still believe thatinterstellar space travel is
necessary for long term civilization survival, and the AI is necessary for
interstellar space travel. On these grounds alone, we could judge that
developing AI is much more safe than not. Nevertheless, there is a basic
reasonable fear, as expressed by some commenters, that AI could go bad.A basic
scenario starts with someone inventing an AI and telling it to make as much
money as possible. The AI promptly starts trading in various markets to make
money. To improve, it crafts a virus that takes over most of the world's
computers using it as a surveillance network so that it can always make the
right decision. The AI also branches out into any form of distance work,
taking over the entire outsourcing process for all jobs that are entirely
digital. To further improve, the AI</p><p>3 0.29792705 <a title="353-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-06-Machine_Learning_to_AI.html">352 hunch net-2009-05-06-Machine Learning to AI</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that
Intelligencescreateontologies, which they use, and without the ability to
create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>4 0.14939937 <a title="353-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-28-Sufficient_Computation.html">287 hunch net-2008-01-28-Sufficient Computation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI? This question is difficult to
answer, but here's a try:One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.
A human brain has about 1015synapses which operate at about 102per second
implying about 1017bit ops per second.A modern computer runs at
109cycles/second and operates on 102bits per cycle implying 1011bits processed
per second.The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly
surpassed via cluster machines. For example, theBlueGene/Loperates 105nodes
(one order of magnitude short). It's peak recorded performance is about
0.5*1015FLOPS which translates to about 1016bit ops per second, which is
nearly 1017.There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this
argument.Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.
Perhaps an additional 102is required per neuron.We may not need to simulate a
human brain to achieve AI. There are certainly many examples where we have
been able to design</p><p>5 0.14069322 <a title="353-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-It_Doesn%26%238217%3Bt_Stop.html">295 hunch net-2008-04-12-It Doesn&#8217;t Stop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

<p>Introduction: Yann and I have arranged so that people who are interested in ourlarge scale
machine learning classand not able to attend in person can follow along via
two methods.Videoswill be posted with about a 1 day delay ontechtalks. This is
a side-by-side capture of video+slides fromWeyond.We are experimenting
withPiazzaas a discussion forum. Anyone is welcome to subscribe to Piazza and
ask questions there, where I will be monitoring things.update2: Sign

slideswhich fixes a few typos and rounds out references.</p><p>2 0.92003119 <a title="353-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-15-Normal_Deviate_and_the_UCSC_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">467 hunch net-2012-06-15-Normal Deviate and the UCSC Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There are at least3summer schools related to machine learning this summer.The
firstis atUniversity of ChicagoJune 1-11 organized byMisha Belkin,Partha
Niyogi, andSteve Smale. Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met
their capacity limit. The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.
I was particularly interested to seeValiantamongst the speakers. I'm also
presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction.Praveen
Srinivasanpoints out the second atPeking Universityin Beijing, China, July
20-27.This onediffers substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning,
and their intersection. The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15. This
is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active
support fromNSF.The third one is atCambridge, England, August 29-September 10.
It's in theMLSS series. Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about
the Bayesian side of ML, although effort has been made to create a good cross
section of topic</p><p>same-blog 4 0.88876188 <a title="353-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so. Since
computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise
some questions.The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient
smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is
not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply
become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI
(as opposed toGOFAIrooted in logic).Let me show by analogy whylimiting
research to computational questions is bad for any field.Except in computer
science, computational aspects play little role in the development
offundamentaltheories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice,
foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field)
theory, string theory, â&euro;Ś Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental
theory seems to be less computable th</p><p>5 0.88151562 <a title="353-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-02-The_Machine_Learning_Award_goes_to_%26%238230%3B.html">270 hunch net-2007-11-02-The Machine Learning Award goes to &#8230;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is theTuring Award, which has a
$0.25M cash prize associated with it. It appears none of the prizes so far
have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database
awards).In CS theory, there is theGÃƒÂ¶del Prizewhich is smaller and newer,
offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition. One
such award has been given for Machine Learning, toRobert SchapireandYoav
Freundfor Adaboost.In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of
these sorts of prizes. There are several plausible reasons for this:There is
no coherent community.People drift in and out of the central conferences all
the time. Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the
conferences of today. In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new.There
are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.Machine Learning

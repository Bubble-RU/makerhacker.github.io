</p><p>6 These two approaches have a similar economic cost, with the additional effort in the second approach being offset by the fact that it is a one-time effort rather than an annual effort. [sent-9, score-0.475]
</p><p>7 I’m sure many people prefer the classroom approach, because it’s traditional, because a teacher can adjust dynamically and intelligently to the student, and because a teacher provides ancillary benefits such as day care and child abuse detection. [sent-10, score-0.582]

The point of this picture is that even in 3 dimensions and even with linear constraints, finding the minima of a set in an online fashion can be typically faster than finding the minima in a batch fashion.  To see this, note that there is a minimal number of gradient updates (i.e. 2) required in order to reach the minima in the typical case.

<p>Introduction: It turns out that many different people use the term “Online Learning”, and often they don’t have the same definition in mind.  Here’s a list of the possibilities I know of.  
  
  Online Information Setting   Online learning refers to a  problem  in which unlabeled data comes, a prediction is made, and then feedback is acquired. 
  Online Adversarial Setting  Online learning refers to  algorithms  in the Online Information Setting which satisfy guarantees of the form: “For all possible sequences of observations, the algorithim has regret at most  log ( number of strategies)  with respect to the best strategy in a set.”  This is sometimes called online learning with experts. 
  Online Optimization Constraint  Online learning refers to optimizing a predictor via a learning algorithm tunes parameters on a per-example basis.  This may or may not be applied in the Online Information Setting, and the strategy may or may not satisfy Adversarial setting theory.

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem.  When someone screws up, do you fire them?  Or do you accept the error and let them continue?  This is a very difficult problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.
 
 Online learning  (as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the online learning model.  
 
In the online learning model, there are a set of hypotheses or “experts”.  On any instantance  x , each expert makes a prediction  y .  A master algorithm  A  uses these predictions to form it’s own prediction  y A   and then  learns the correct prediction  y *  .  This process repeats.
 
The goal of online learning is to find a master algorithm  A  which uses the advice of the experts to make good predictions.  In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert.

<p>Introduction: David Mcallester  gave a talk about this  paper  (with  Pedro Felzenszwalb ).  I’ll try to give a high level summary of why it’s interesting.
 
Dynamic programming is most familiar as instantiated by Viterbi decoding in a hidden markov model.  It is a general paradigm for problem solving where subproblems are solved and used to solve larger problems.  In the Viterbi decoding example, the subproblem is “What is the most probable path ending at each state at timestep  t ?”, and the larger problem is the same except at timestep  t+1 .  There are a few optimizations you can do here:
  
  Dynamic Programming -> queued Dynamic Programming . Keep track of the “cost so far” (or “most probable path”) and (carefully) only look at extensions to paths likely to yield the shortest path.  “Carefully” here is defined by  Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm .

  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .

<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm.  This ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory.  The general form of a theorem is:  If  preconditions  Then  postconditions     When we design learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions such as “the data is IID”, “the learning problem is drawn from a known distribution over learning problems”, or “there is a perfect classifier”.  All of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways that are not easily detectable.  This means that algorithms derived and justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic failure in routine (mis)application.
 
We  can  hope for better.  Several different kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have fewer preconditions.  Simply demanding that these forms of analysi</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90491736 <a title="378-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you search for “online learning” with any  major   search   engine , it’s interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.  This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering.  In other words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9 results.  The essential observation here is that the process of human learning is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.  
 
The internet is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider two possibilities:
  
 The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is, with many teachers for the same subject. 
 All the teachers for one subject get together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in online delivery.  They spend a factor of 4 more time designing</p><p>5 0.90000397 <a title="378-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-17-Online_as_the_new_adjective.html">267 hunch net-2007-10-17-Online as the new adjective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Online learning is in vogue, which means we should expect to see in the near future:
  
 Online boosting. 
 Online decision trees. 
 Online SVMs.  (actually, we’ve already seen) 
 Online deep learning. 
 Online parallel learning. 
 etc… 
  
There are three fundamental drivers of this trend. 
  
 Increasing size of datasets makes online algorithms attractive.   
 Online learning can simply be more efficient than batch learning.  Here is a picture from a class on online learning: 
  
The point of this picture is that even in 3 dimensions and even with linear constraints, finding the minima of a set in an online fashion can be typically faster than finding the minima in a batch fashion.  To see this, note that there is a minimal number of gradient updates (i.e. 2) required in order to reach the minima in the typical case.  Given this, it’s best to do these updates as quickly as possible, which implies doing the first update online (i.e. before seeing all the examples) is preferred.

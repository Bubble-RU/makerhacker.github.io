<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>5 0.12331333 <a title="358-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first
personeverto have some thought. How do you think of something that has never
been thought of? There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but
there are some tricks.The easiest method is to just have some connection come
to you. There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out
the idea immediately because it can just as easily go away.A harder method is
to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea. Distraction
elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard
work which your mind will avoid.Another common method is in conversation.
Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes
whoever you are talking to replies just the right way. This method is
dangerous though--you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than
someone who occupies your thoughts.Try to rephrase the problem so the answer
is simple. This is</p><p>6 0.12308716 <a title="358-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>3 0.75927162 <a title="358-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting. Neither of these is written
from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.Why smart
people have bad ideasby Paul GrahamWhy smart people defend bad ideasby Scott
Berkun (which appeared onslashdot)In my experience, bad ideas are
commonandover confidence in ideas is common. This overconfidence can take
either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise. Some of this is
necessary to the process of research. For example, some overconfidence in the
value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your
own investigation. Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does
not pan out. Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical
skill which is sometimes never acquired.Excessive condemnation can be a real
ill when it's encountered. This has two effects:When the penalty for being
wrong is too large, it means people have a great investment in defending

anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9. I believe this
is an idea whose time has now come.The NIPS website doesn't have other
workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant
interest.</p><p>2 0.9284479 <a title="358-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-28-Asking_questions.html">257 hunch net-2007-07-28-Asking questions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are very substantial differences in how question asking is viewed
culturally. For example, all of the following are common:If no one asks a
question, then no one is paying attention.To ask a question is disrespectful
of the speaker.Asking a question is admitting your own ignorance.The first
view seems to be the right one for research, for several reasons.Research is
quite hard--it's difficult to guess how people won't understand something in
advance while preparing a presentation. Consequently, it's very common to lose
people. No worthwhile presenter wants that.Real understanding is precious. By
asking a question, you are really declaring "I want to understand", and
everyone should respect that.Asking a question wakes you up. I don't mean from
"asleep" to "awake" but from "awake" to "really awake". It's easy to drift
through something sort-of-understanding. When you ask a question, especially
because you are on the spot, you will do much better.Some of these effects

<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done. For example it's
common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial
solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting
in a paper. In some sense, these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we
should ask: Can all research be this easy?The answer is certainly no for
fields where research inherently requires experimentation to discover how the
real world works. However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer
science, statistics, etcâ&euro;Ś which are effectively mathematics don't require
experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of
thinking. Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?What's going on
here is research-by-communication. Someone knows something, someone knows
something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.
The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming
radically easier with</p><p>4 0.82419819 <a title="358-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>6 0.82087952 <a title="358-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

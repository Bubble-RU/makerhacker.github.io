</p><p>4 The essential difficulty is that doing good research often requires the simultaneous understanding of several different things—the problem, all the broken approaches to solving some problem, why they break, and some hint about where to look for a solution. [sent-15, score-0.599]
</p><p>5 Often, a problem is not immediately solved the first time it is thought of, instead a researcher must attack it again and again, until either giving up or finding a solution. [sent-18, score-0.316]
</p><p>6 A basic parameter in attacking a problem is: How hard is it to resume where you left off? [sent-19, score-0.317]
</p><p>7 Even if I worked on such a problem yesterday, it might take a half hour or an hour to reach a state where I’m prepared to make progress. [sent-22, score-0.485]
</p><p>8 Given the difficulty of research, I (and many other people) often struggle in dealing with interruptions. [sent-23, score-0.53]
</p><p>9 Modern technology has made communication very easy, implying a stream of potential interruptions throughout the day, some of which are undeniably fruitful. [sent-24, score-0.434]
</p><p>10 And yet, an interruption means the overhead of getting back to thinking must be paid yet again. [sent-25, score-0.284]
</p><p>11 Trading off properly between the value of avoiding the overhead and the value of dealing with interruptions is a constant struggle which typically did not exist before before modern communication technology made it prevalent. [sent-26, score-1.104]
</p><p>12 I think it is common to give in to the interrupts, and effectively cease to be able to do research other than research-by-communication. [sent-27, score-0.285]
</p><p>13 There is the standard problem that people you deal with don’t understand the overhead of switching tasks in research. [sent-30, score-0.392]
</p><p>14 Coping with the modern world requires that at least some portion of our time be devoted to interrupts, which are almost always easier to deal with than research. [sent-32, score-0.495]
</p><p>15 Dealing with these interrupts therefore can create a bad habit where you seek interrupts to achieve the (short term, easy) gratification of dealing with them. [sent-33, score-1.021]
</p><p>16 Thus, multitasking creates an internal expectation of multitasking, which makes multitasking preferred, eliminating the ability to do careful research. [sent-34, score-0.478]
</p><p>17 I don’t have a good answer to this problem, other than continuing the struggle to preserve substantial contiguous chunks of time for thinking. [sent-36, score-0.432]
</p><p>18 An alternative sometimes-applicable solution is to reduce the overhead of starting to solve a problem by decomposing the problem into subproblems. [sent-37, score-0.743]
</p><p>19 Where possible, this is of course valuable, but mathematical research is often almost uniquely undecomposable, because the nature of the problem is that it’s solution is unknown and hence undecomposable. [sent-38, score-0.569]

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point of view of an undergraduate.  The shift from a class-taking mentality to a research mentality is very significant and not easy.  
  
  Problem Posing  Posing the right problem is often as important as solving them.  Many people can get by in research by solving problems others have posed, but that’s not sufficient for really inspiring research.  For learning in particular, there is a strong feeling that we just haven’t figured out which questions are the right ones to ask.  You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem convincing. 
  Gambling your life  When you do research, you think very hard about new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions.  Many conversations are of the form “I wonder what would happen if…” These processes can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours.  The worst part is that you’ll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and some</p><p>4 0.13292401 <a title="358-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.
  
 Both the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education s</p><p>5 0.12705375 <a title="358-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first person  ever  to have some thought.  How do you think of something that has never been thought of?  There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but there are some tricks.
  
 The easiest method is to just have some connection come to you.  There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out the idea immediately because  it can just as easily go away. 
 A harder method is to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea.  Distraction elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard work which your mind will avoid. 
 Another common method is in conversation.  Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes whoever you are talking to replies just the right way.  This method is dangerous though—you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than someone who occupies your thoughts.

<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea how to solve.  In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a solution to the larger problem.  This approach can go wrong in several ways. 
  
  Decomposition failure .  The solution to the decomposition does not in fact yield a solution to the overall problem. 
  Artificial hardness .  The subproblems created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are harder than necessary. 
  
As you can see, computational complexity forms a relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach sufficient but not necessary.
 
In my experience, the artificial hardness problem is very common.  Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a problem to work on to other people.  This process starts very naturally as a graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively l</p><p>3 0.75973529 <a title="358-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.

<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting.  Neither of these is written from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.
  
  Why smart people have bad ideas  by Paul Graham 
  Why smart people defend bad ideas  by Scott Berkun (which appeared on  slashdot ) 
  
In my experience, bad ideas are common  and  over confidence in ideas is common.  This overconfidence can take either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise.  Some of this is necessary to the process of research.  For example, some overconfidence in the value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your own investigation.  Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does not pan out.  Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical skill which is sometimes never acquired.
 
Excessive condemnation can be a real ill when it’s encountered.  This has two effects:

<p>Introduction: This is a proposal for a workshop.  It may or may not happen depending on the level of interest.  If you are interested, feel free to indicate so (by email or comments).
 
Description: 
Assume(*) that any system for solving large difficult learning problems must decompose into repeated use of basic elements (i.e. atoms).  There are many basic questions which remain:
  
  What are the viable basic elements? 
  What makes a basic element viable? 
  What are the viable principles for the composition of these basic elements? 
  What are the viable principles for learning in such systems? 
  What problems can this approach handle? 
  
Hal Daume adds:
  
 Can composition of atoms be (semi-) automatically constructed[?] 
 When atoms are constructed through reductions, is there some notion of the “naturalness” of the created leaning problems? 
 Other than Markov fields/graphical models/Bayes nets, is there a good language for representing atoms and their compositions? 
  
The answer to these a</p><p>2 0.90405464 <a title="358-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90218776 <a title="358-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-01-Multitask_Poisoning.html">358 hunch net-2009-06-01-Multitask Poisoning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done.  For example it’s common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting in a paper.  In some sense,  these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we should ask: Can all research be this easy?  
 
The answer is certainly no for fields where research inherently requires  experimentation to discover how the real world works.  However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer science, statistics, etc… which are effectively mathematics don’t require experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of thinking.  Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?
 
What’s going on here is research-by-communication.  Someone knows something, someone knows something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.  The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming radic</p><p>4 0.89374995 <a title="358-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-19-NIPS_Workshops.html">113 hunch net-2005-09-19-NIPS Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attendance at the  NIPS workshops  is highly recommended for both research and learning.   Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of interest:
  
  Machine Learning in Finance  
  Learning to Rank  
  Foundations of Active Learning  
  Machine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured Environments  
  
There are  many  more workshops.  In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in.  Maybe in future years the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap. 
 
Many of these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>5 0.83045763 <a title="358-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-08-Question%3A_%26%238220%3BWhen_is_the_right_time_to_insert_the_loss_function%3F%26%238221%3B.html">79 hunch net-2005-06-08-Question: &#8220;When is the right time to insert the loss function?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hal  asks   a very good question: “When is the right time to insert the loss function?”  In particular, should it be used at testing time or at training time?
 
When the world imposes a loss on us, the standard Bayesian recipe is to predict the (conditional) probability of each possibility and then choose the possibility which minimizes the expected loss.  In contrast, as the  confusion  over “loss = money lost” or “loss = the thing you optimize” might indicate, many people ignore the Bayesian approach and simply optimize their loss (or a close proxy for their loss) over the representation on the training set.
 
The best answer I can give is “it’s unclear, but I prefer optimizing the loss at training time”.  My experience is that optimizing the loss in the most direct manner possible typically yields best performance.  This question is related to a basic principle which both  Yann LeCun (applied) and  Vladimir Vapnik (theoretical) advocate: “solve the simplest prediction problem that s</p><p>6 0.76990783 <a title="358-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>

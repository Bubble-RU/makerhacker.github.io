<p>Introduction: Watsonconvincingly beat the best championJeopardy!players. The apparent
significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge
about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology. For a random
person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for
people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good
assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire
system work.Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed
to put together and execute this project--many years of effort by a diverse
set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen. In academia,
it's pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent,
and in industry it's rarely the case that such a capable group has both a
worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for
several years before success.Alinainvited me to the Jeopardy watching party

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI? This question is difficult to
answer, but here's a try:One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.
A human brain has about 1015synapses which operate at about 102per second
implying about 1017bit ops per second.A modern computer runs at
109cycles/second and operates on 102bits per cycle implying 1011bits processed
per second.The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly
surpassed via cluster machines. For example, theBlueGene/Loperates 105nodes
(one order of magnitude short). It's peak recorded performance is about
0.5*1015FLOPS which translates to about 1016bit ops per second, which is
nearly 1017.There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this
argument.Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.
Perhaps an additional 102is required per neuron.We may not need to simulate a
human brain to achieve AI. There are certainly many examples where we have
been able to design</p><p>5 0.72450674 <a title="352-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-It_Doesn%26%238217%3Bt_Stop.html">295 hunch net-2008-04-12-It Doesn&#8217;t Stop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko
AllocationWei Li, Andrew McCallumA very elegant (but computationally
challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level
DAG whose interior nodesare "super-topics" and "sub-topics" and whose leaves
are thevocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning
stir.Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another
session)Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency ConstraintsMukund

<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that
Intelligencescreateontologies, which they use, and without the ability to
create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>3 0.90370983 <a title="352-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>4 0.89499068 <a title="352-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-03-Not_ICML.html">117 hunch net-2005-10-03-Not ICML</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Smolashowed me thisICML 2006webpage. This isNOTthe ICML we know, but
rather some people at "Enformatika". Investigation shows that they registered
with an anonymous yahoo email account fromdotregistrar.comthe "Home of the
$6.79 wholesale domain!" and their nameservers are byTurkticaret, a Turkish
internet company.It appears the website has since been altered to "ICNL" (the
above link uses the google cache).They say that imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, so the organizers of the realICML 2006must feel quite
flattered.</p><p>5 0.87268841 <a title="352-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a
good fit for their expertise (-.037 w.r.t 2010). Achieving this was one of our

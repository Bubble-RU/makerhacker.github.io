  Daniel Hsu  has diverse papers with diverse coauthors on {active learning, mulitlabeling, temporal learning, …} each covering new algorithms and methods of analysis.

<p>Introduction: A new direction of research seems to be arising in machine learning: Interactive Machine Learning.  This isn’t a familiar term, although it does include some familiar subjects.
 
 What is Interactive Machine Learning?   The fundamental requirement is (a) learning algorithms which interact with the world and (b) learn.  
 
For our purposes, let’s define learning as efficiently competing with a large set of possible predictors.  Examples include:
  
 Online learning against an adversary ( Avrim’s Notes ).  The interaction is almost trivial: the learning algorithm makes a prediction and then receives feedback. The learning is choosing based upon the advice of many experts. 
   Active Learning  .  In active learning, the interaction is choosing which examples to label, and the learning is choosing from amongst a large set of hypotheses. 
   Contextual Bandits  .  The interaction is choosing one of several actions and learning only the value of the chosen action (weaker than active learning</p><p>4 0.10516048 <a title="376-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea how to solve.  In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a solution to the larger problem.  This approach can go wrong in several ways. 
  
  Decomposition failure .  The solution to the decomposition does not in fact yield a solution to the overall problem. 
  Artificial hardness .  The subproblems created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are harder than necessary. 
  
As you can see, computational complexity forms a relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach sufficient but not necessary.
 
In my experience, the artificial hardness problem is very common.  Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a problem to work on to other people.  This process starts very naturally as a graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively l</p><p>5 0.09511286 <a title="376-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-13-Sam_Roweis_died.html">386 hunch net-2010-01-13-Sam Roweis died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: and I can’t help but remember him.
 
I first met  Sam  as an undergraduate at  Caltech  where he was TA for  Hopfield ‘s class, and again when I visited  Gatsby , when he invited me to visit  Toronto , and at too many conferences to recount.  His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great ability to phrase a problem so it’s solution must be understood.  With respect to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to make  my first tutorial , leading to others, and to other things, all of which I’m grateful to him for.  In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.
 
His death is  being called a suicide  which is so incompatible with my understanding of Sam that it strains my credibility.  But we know that his many responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane researchers have legions of inner doubts.

<p>Introduction: I was not as personally close to  Ben  as  Sam , but the level of tragedy is similar and I canâ&euro;&trade;t help but be greatly saddened by the loss.
 
Various  news   stories  have coverage, but the synopsis is that he had a heart attack on Sunday and is survived by his wife Anat and daughter Aviv.  There is discussion of creating a memorial fund for them, which I hope comes to fruition, and plan to contribute to.  
 
I will remember Ben as someone who thought carefully and comprehensively about new ways to do things, then fought hard and successfully for what he believed in.  It is an ideal we strive for, that Ben accomplished.

<p>Introduction: The 20 13 14 is  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is finally happening on March 28th at the  New York Academy of Science .  Every invited speaker interests me personally.  They are:
  
  Rayid Ghani  (Chief Scientist at Obama 2012) 
  Brian Kingsbury  (Speech Recognition @ IBM) 
  Jorge Nocedal  (who did LBFGS) 
  
Weâ&euro;&trade;ve been somewhat disorganized in advertising this.  As a consequence, anyone who has not submitted an abstract but would like to do so may send one directly to me (jl@hunch.net title NYASMLS) by Friday March 14.  I will forward them to the rest of the committee for consideration.</p><p>3 0.67947602 <a title="376-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-19-Netflix_prize_within_epsilon.html">336 hunch net-2009-01-19-Netflix prize within epsilon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The competitors for the  Netflix Prize  are tantalizingly close winning the million dollar prize.  This year,  BellKor  and  Commendo Research  sent a combined solution that won the  progress prize .  Reading the  writeups   2  is instructive.  Several aspects of solutions are taken for granted including stochastic gradient descent, ensemble prediction, and targeting residuals (a form of boosting).  Relatively to last year, it appears that many approaches have added parameterizations, especially for the purpose of modeling through time.
 
The big question is: will they make the big prize?  At this point, the level of complexity in entering the competition is prohibitive, so perhaps only the existing competitors will continue to try.  (This equation might change drastically if the teams open source their existing solutions, including parameter settings.) One fear is that the progress is asymptoting on the wrong side of the 10% threshold.  In the first year, the teams progressed through</p><p>4 0.67856735 <a title="376-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-08-Predictive_Analytics_World.html">335 hunch net-2009-01-08-Predictive Analytics World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carla Vicens and  Eric Siegel  contacted me about  Predictive Analytics World  in San Francisco February 18&19, which I wasn’t familiar with.  A quick look at the  agenda  reveals several people I know working on applications of machine learning in businesses, covering deployed applications topics.  It’s interesting to see a business-focused machine learning conference, as it says that we are succeeding as a field.  If you are interested in deployed applications, you might attend.
 
Eric and I did a quick interview by email.

I’ve mostly published and participated in academic machine learning conferences like ICML, COLT, and NIPS.   When I look at the  set of speakers and subjects  for your conference  I think “machine learning for business”.  Is that your understanding of things? What I’m trying to ask is: what do you view as the primary goal for this conference?

 You got it.  This is the business event focused on the commercial deployment of technology developed at</p><p>5 0.47977248 <a title="376-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-28-Regularization.html">33 hunch net-2005-02-28-Regularization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yaroslav Bulatov  says that we should think about regularization a bit.  It’s a complex topic which I only partially understand, so I’ll try to explain from a couple viewpoints.
  
  Functionally . Regularization is optimizing some representation to fit the data  and  minimize some notion of predictor complexity.  This notion of complexity is often the l 1  or l 2  norm on a set of parameters, but the term can be used much more generally.  Empirically, this often works much better than simply fitting the data. 
  Statistical Learning Viewpoint  Regularization is about the failiure of statistical learning to adequately predict generalization error.  Let  e(c,D)  be the expected error rate with respect to  D  of classifier  c  and  e(c,S)  the observed error rate on a sample  S .  There are numerous bounds of the form: assuming i.i.d. samples, with high probability over the drawn samples  S ,   e(c,D) less than e(c,S) + f(complexity)  where  complexity  is some measure of the size of a s</p><p>6 0.44536492 <a title="376-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML_Open_Questions_and_ICML_Instructions.html">458 hunch net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML Open Questions and ICML Instructions</a></p>

nicely readable description of the necessity and potential of interactive
learning to deal with the information overload problem that is endemic to the

<p>Introduction: A new direction of research seems to be arising in machine learning:
Interactive Machine Learning. This isn't a familiar term, although it does
include some familiar subjects.What is Interactive Machine Learning?The
fundamental requirement is (a) learning algorithms which interact with the
world and (b) learn.For our purposes, let's define learning as efficiently
competing with a large set of possible predictors. Examples include:Online
learning against an adversary (Avrim's Notes). The interaction is almost
trivial: the learning algorithm makes a prediction and then receives feedback.
The learning is choosing based upon the advice of many experts.Active
Learning. In active learning, the interaction is choosing which examples to
label, and the learning is choosing from amongst a large set of
hypotheses.Contextual Bandits. The interaction is choosing one of several
actions and learning only the value of the chosen action (weaker than active
learning feedback).More forms of interaction w</p><p>3 0.10512872 <a title="376-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>4 0.094288118 <a title="376-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-11-Visa_Casualties.html">69 hunch net-2005-05-11-Visa Casualties</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For theChicago 2005 machine learning summer schoolwe are organizing, at least
5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>5 0.077151202 <a title="376-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-14-NIPS_workshp%3A_Learning_Problem_Design.html">265 hunch net-2007-10-14-NIPS workshp: Learning Problem Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>3 0.62241173 <a title="376-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-18-Multiplication_of_Learned_Probabilities_is_Dangerous.html">157 hunch net-2006-02-18-Multiplication of Learned Probabilities is Dangerous</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive
Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models. A number of people are aware of it,
but it seems that not everyone is.Several learning systems have the property
that they estimate some conditional probabilitiesP(event | other events)either
explicitly or implicitly. Then, at prediction time, these learned
probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a
final prediction. The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest
of these, so it seems like a good example.When Naive Bayes is used, a set of
probabilities of the formPr'(feature i | label)are estimated via counting
statistics and some prior. Predictions are made according to the label
maximizing:Pr'(label) * Productfeatures iPr'(feature i | label)(ThePr'notation
indicates these are estimated values.)There is nothing wrong with this method
as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is very strong and (b) the
prior (on the c</p><p>4 0.58102548 <a title="376-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the "right" way to do
machine learning. This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.
The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a
reply2.The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and
general. Essentially, you first specify a priorP(D)over possible
processesDproducing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data
according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)After
this, hard decisions are made (such as "turn left" or "turn right") by
choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior)
loss.This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices
ofP(D)and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice
properties:There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual
distribution generating the data is drawn fromP(D)there is no better method.
One way to think about this is that in</p><p>5 0.56522101 <a title="376-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize.html">402 hunch net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize</a></p>

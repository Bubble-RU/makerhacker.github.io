</p><p>7 Academics' term, "machine learning," is essentially synonymous with the business world's "predictive modeling". [sent-12, score-0.492]
</p><p>8 Predictive Analytics World focuses on business applications of this technology, such as response modeling, churn modeling, email targeting, product recommendations, insurance pricing, and credit scoring. [sent-13, score-0.547]
</p><p>9 PAW's goal is to strengthen the business impact delivered by predictive analytics deployment, and establish new opportunities with predictive analytics. [sent-14, score-1.361]
</p><p>10 The conference delivers case studies, expertise and resources to this end. [sent-15, score-0.098]
</p><p>11 John >People at academic conferences would hope that technology developed there can transfer into business use. [sent-17, score-0.949]
</p><p>12 Eric >The best way to catalyze commercial deployment is to show the people it really works outside "the lab" - which is why PAW's program is packed primarily with named case studies of commercial deployment. [sent-20, score-0.963]
</p><p>13 These success stories answer your question with a resounding "yes" that the core technology developed academically is indeed put to use. [sent-21, score-0.577]
</p><p>14 But predictive analytics has not yet been broadly adopted across all industries, although success stories show at least initial reach in each vertical. [sent-22, score-0.902]
</p><p>15 So, sure, as one who previously wore a researcher's hat, commercial deployment can feel slow; having solved the hardest theoretical, mathematical or statistical problems, the rest should go smoothly, right? [sent-23, score-0.588]
</p><p>16 The main challenges come in ramping up the business "consumer" on the technology so they see its value, positioning the technology in a way that provides business value, and, on the integration side, in preparing corporate data for predictive modeling (that's a doozy!

<p>Introduction: TheNew York ML symposiumwas last Friday. There were 303 registrations, up a
bit fromlast year. I particularly enjoyed talks byBill Freemanon vision and
ML,Jon Lenchneron strategy in Jeopardy, andTara N. Sainathand Brian Kingsbury
ondeep learning for speech recognition. If anyone has suggestions or thoughts
for next year, please speak up.I also attendedStrata + Hadoop Worldfor the
first time. This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic
conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee. This
is ground zero for theBig databuzzword, and I see now why. It's about data,
and the word "big" is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it. There
were essentially zero academic talks. Instead, the focus was on war stories,
product announcements, and education. The general level of education is much
lower--explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary
operating point. Nevertheless that's happening, and the fact that machine

<p>Introduction: There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes. Many classes
are of the 'zoo' sort: many different learning algorithms are presented.
Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning.This
is my view of what makes a good machine learning class, along with why. I'd
like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing,
misemphasized, or misplaced.PhaseSubjectWhy?IntroductionWhat is a machine
learning problem?A good understanding of the characteristics of machine
learning problems seems essential. Characteristics include: a data source,
some hope the data is predictive, and a need for generalization. This is
probably best taught in a case study manner: lay out the specifics of some
problem and then ask "Is this a machine learning problem?"IntroductionMachine
Learning Problem IdentificationIdentification and recognition of the type of

<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good

<p>Introduction: and I can't help but remember him.I first metSamas an undergraduate
atCaltechwhere he was TA forHopfield's class, and again when I visitedGatsby,
when he invited me to visitToronto, and at too many conferences to recount.
His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great
ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

<p>Introduction: Slashdotpoints outGoogle Predict. I'm not privy to the details, but this has
the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an
easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.
This differs goalwise fromMLcomp--instead of public comparisons for research
purposes, it's about private utilization of good existing algorithms. It also
differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less
awkward than using Amazon's cloud computing. The latter implies that datasets
several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by
network and storage.</p><p>3 0.98041314 <a title="335-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>4 0.97607005 <a title="335-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-08-Fast_Physics_for_Learning.html">37 hunch net-2005-03-08-Fast Physics for Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>5 0.97439933 <a title="335-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:Updating
toWordPress1.5.Installing and heavily tweaking theGeeknichetheme. Update: I
switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme.Adding theCustomizable
Post Listingsplugin.Installing theStatTraqplugin.Updating some of the links. I
particularly recommend looking at thecomputer research
policyblog.Addingthreaded comments. This doesn't thread old comments
obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones.Overall, I
think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of myearlier problems. If
you have any difficulties or anything seems "not quite right", please speak
up. A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>6 0.97160333 <a title="335-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.
  
  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .  This is stretching the definition of “New York Area” a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable.</p><p>3 0.10929622 <a title="335-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  There were 303 registrations, up a bit from  last year .  I particularly enjoyed talks by  Bill Freeman  on vision and ML,  Jon Lenchner  on strategy in Jeopardy, and  Tara N. Sainath  and Brian Kingsbury on  deep learning for speech recognition .  If anyone has suggestions or thoughts for next year, please speak up.
 
I also attended  Strata + Hadoop World  for the first time.  This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee.  This is ground zero for the  Big data  buzzword, and I see now why.  It’s about data, and the word “big” is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it.  There were essentially zero academic talks.  Instead, the focus was on war stories, product announcements, and education.  The general level of education is much lower—explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary operating point.  Nevertheless that’s happening, a</p><p>4 0.094152518 <a title="335-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-24-A_Fundamentalist_Organization_of_Machine_Learning.html">158 hunch net-2006-02-24-A Fundamentalist Organization of Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes.  Many classes are of the ‘zoo’ sort: many different learning algorithms are presented.  Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning.  
 
This is my view of what makes a good machine learning class, along with why.  I’d like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing, misemphasized, or misplaced.

 Introduction 
 What is a machine learning problem? 
 A good understanding of the characteristics of machine learning problems seems essential.  Characteristics include: a data source, some hope the data is predictive, and a need for generalization.  This is probably best taught in a case study manner: lay out the specifics of some problem and then ask “Is this a machine learning problem?”

<p>Introduction: The consensus of several discussions at ICML is that the number of jobs for people knowing machine learning well substantially exceeds supply.  This is my experience as well.  Demand comes from many places, but I’ve seen particularly strong demand from trading companies and internet startups.
 
Like all interest bursts, this one will probably pass because of economic recession or other distractions.  Nevertheless, the general outlook for machine learning in business seems to be good.  Machine learning is all about optimization when there is uncertainty and lots of data.  The quantity of data available is growing quickly as computer-run processes and sensors become more common, and the quality of the data is dropping since there is little editorial control in it’s collection.  Machine Learning is a difficult subject to master (*), so those who do should remain in demand over the long term.

<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine learning currently underway.  This isn’t easy—this map is partial, the categories often overlap, and there are many details left out.  Nevertheless, it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where.  The word ‘typical’ should not be construed narrowly here.
  
  Learning Theory  Focuses on analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments.  Typical conference: COLT. 
  Bayesian Learning  Bayes law is always used. Focus on methods of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and practical applications.  Typical conferences: NIPS,UAI 
  Structured learning  Predicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical conferences: NIPS, UAI, others 
  Reinforcement Learning  Focused on ‘agent-in-the-world’ learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward.  Typical conferences: ICML

<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in substantially overlapping subjects.
 
The problem seems to be cultural.  Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large publications slowly published under review at journals.  Machine Learning comes from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at reviewed conferences.  This has a number of implications:
  
 Graduating statistics PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might have 5-15. 
 Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on their work.  Stats students have had no such chance. 
 Graduating ML students have attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a chance to meet people.  Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort. 
  
In short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish themselves and</p><p>5 0.56593305 <a title="335-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-27-Key_Scientific_Challenges.html">339 hunch net-2009-01-27-Key Scientific Challenges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>6 0.56410474 <a title="335-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The 20 13 14 is  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is finally happening on March 28th at the  New York Academy of Science .  Every invited speaker interests me personally.  They are:
  
  Rayid Ghani  (Chief Scientist at Obama 2012) 
  Brian Kingsbury  (Speech Recognition @ IBM) 
  Jorge Nocedal  (who did LBFGS) 
  
Weâ&euro;&trade;ve been somewhat disorganized in advertising this.  As a consequence, anyone who has not submitted an abstract but would like to do so may send one directly to me (jl@hunch.net title NYASMLS) by Friday March 14.  I will forward them to the rest of the committee for consideration.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85608989 <a title="335-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-08-Predictive_Analytics_World.html">335 hunch net-2009-01-08-Predictive Analytics World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carla Vicens and  Eric Siegel  contacted me about  Predictive Analytics World  in San Francisco February 18&19, which I wasn’t familiar with.  A quick look at the  agenda  reveals several people I know working on applications of machine learning in businesses, covering deployed applications topics.  It’s interesting to see a business-focused machine learning conference, as it says that we are succeeding as a field.  If you are interested in deployed applications, you might attend.
 
Eric and I did a quick interview by email.

I’ve mostly published and participated in academic machine learning conferences like ICML, COLT, and NIPS.   When I look at the  set of speakers and subjects  for your conference  I think “machine learning for business”.  Is that your understanding of things? What I’m trying to ask is: what do you view as the primary goal for this conference?

<p>Introduction: The competitors for the  Netflix Prize  are tantalizingly close winning the million dollar prize.  This year,  BellKor  and  Commendo Research  sent a combined solution that won the  progress prize .  Reading the  writeups   2  is instructive.  Several aspects of solutions are taken for granted including stochastic gradient descent, ensemble prediction, and targeting residuals (a form of boosting).  Relatively to last year, it appears that many approaches have added parameterizations, especially for the purpose of modeling through time.
 
The big question is: will they make the big prize?  At this point, the level of complexity in entering the competition is prohibitive, so perhaps only the existing competitors will continue to try.  (This equation might change drastically if the teams open source their existing solutions, including parameter settings.) One fear is that the progress is asymptoting on the wrong side of the 10% threshold.  In the first year, the teams progressed through</p><p>5 0.67312288 <a title="335-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML_Open_Questions_and_ICML_Instructions.html">458 hunch net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML Open Questions and ICML Instructions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sasha  is the  open problems  chair for both  COLT   and   ICML .  Open problems will be presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day.   COLT has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML.  If you have a difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider submitting it for review,  due March 16 .  You’ll benefit three ways: 
  
 The effort of writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand the nature of the problem. 
 Your problem will be officially published and citable. 
 You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people. 
  
The general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical variety.

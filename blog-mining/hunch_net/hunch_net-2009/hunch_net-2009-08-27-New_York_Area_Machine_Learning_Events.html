<p>Introduction: Manik  and I are organizing the  extreme classification  workshop at NIPS this year.  We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9.  I believe this is an idea whose time has now come.
 
The NIPS website doesnâ&euro;&trade;t have other workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant interest.</p><p>3 0.14260247 <a title="369-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-04-Fall_ML_Conferences.html">316 hunch net-2008-09-04-Fall ML Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are in the New York area and interested in machine learning, consider submitting a 2 page abstract to the  ML symposium  by tomorrow (Sept 5th) midnight.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s a fun one day affair on October 10 in an awesome location overlooking the world trade center site.
 
A bit further off (but a real conference) is the  AI and Stats  deadline on November 5, to be held in Florida April 16-19.</p><p>4 0.12807204 <a title="369-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-02-%241M_Netflix_prediction_contest.html">211 hunch net-2006-10-02-$1M Netflix prediction contest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Netflix is  running a contest  to improve recommender prediction systems.   A 10% improvement over their current system yields a $1M prize.  Failing that, the best smaller improvement yields a smaller $50K prize.  This contest looks quite real, and the $50K prize money is almost certainly achievable with a bit of thought.  The contest also comes with a dataset which is apparently 2 orders of magnitude larger than any other public recommendation system datasets.</p><p>5 0.12707922 <a title="369-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-08-Predictive_Analytics_World.html">335 hunch net-2009-01-08-Predictive Analytics World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carla Vicens and  Eric Siegel  contacted me about  Predictive Analytics World  in San Francisco February 18&19, which I wasn’t familiar with.  A quick look at the  agenda  reveals several people I know working on applications of machine learning in businesses, covering deployed applications topics.  It’s interesting to see a business-focused machine learning conference, as it says that we are succeeding as a field.  If you are interested in deployed applications, you might attend.
 
Eric and I did a quick interview by email.
 
John > 
I’ve mostly published and participated in academic machine learning conferences like ICML, COLT, and NIPS.   When I look at the  set of speakers and subjects  for your conference  I think “machine learning for business”.  Is that your understanding of things? What I’m trying to ask is: what do you view as the primary goal for this conference?

<p>Introduction: has  died .   He lived a full life.  I know him personally as a founder of the  Center for Computational Learning Systems  and the  New York Machine Learning Symposium , both of which have sheltered and promoted the advancement of machine learning.  I expect much of the New York area machine learning community will miss him, as well as many others around the world.</p><p>4 0.66696489 <a title="369-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  There were 303 registrations, up a bit from  last year .  I particularly enjoyed talks by  Bill Freeman  on vision and ML,  Jon Lenchner  on strategy in Jeopardy, and  Tara N. Sainath  and Brian Kingsbury on  deep learning for speech recognition .  If anyone has suggestions or thoughts for next year, please speak up.
 
I also attended  Strata + Hadoop World  for the first time.  This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee.  This is ground zero for the  Big data  buzzword, and I see now why.  It’s about data, and the word “big” is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it.  There were essentially zero academic talks.  Instead, the focus was on war stories, product announcements, and education.  The general level of education is much lower—explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary operating point.  Nevertheless that’s happening, a</p><p>5 0.66124815 <a title="369-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-18-7th_Annual_Machine_Learning_Symposium.html">474 hunch net-2012-10-18-7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>6 0.65809101 <a title="369-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-03-11-The_New_York_ML_Symposium%2C_take_2.html">494 hunch net-2014-03-11-The New York ML Symposium, take 2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.
  
  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .  This is stretching the definition of “New York Area” a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable.</p><p>2 0.86338753 <a title="369-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Mcallester  gave a talk about this  paper  (with  Pedro Felzenszwalb ).  I’ll try to give a high level summary of why it’s interesting.
 
Dynamic programming is most familiar as instantiated by Viterbi decoding in a hidden markov model.  It is a general paradigm for problem solving where subproblems are solved and used to solve larger problems.  In the Viterbi decoding example, the subproblem is “What is the most probable path ending at each state at timestep  t ?”, and the larger problem is the same except at timestep  t+1 .  There are a few optimizations you can do here:
  
  Dynamic Programming -> queued Dynamic Programming . Keep track of the “cost so far” (or “most probable path”) and (carefully) only look at extensions to paths likely to yield the shortest path.  “Carefully” here is defined by  Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm . 
  queued Dynamic programming -> A *  Add a lower bound on the cost to complete a path (or an upper bound on the probability of a completion) for</p><p>3 0.77407765 <a title="369-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-26-Fallback_Analysis_is_a_Secret_to_Useful_Algorithms.html">126 hunch net-2005-10-26-Fallback Analysis is a Secret to Useful Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm.  This ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory.  The general form of a theorem is:  If  preconditions  Then  postconditions     When we design learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions such as “the data is IID”, “the learning problem is drawn from a known distribution over learning problems”, or “there is a perfect classifier”.  All of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways that are not easily detectable.  This means that algorithms derived and justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic failure in routine (mis)application.
 
We  can  hope for better.  Several different kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have fewer preconditions.  Simply demanding that these forms of analysi</p><p>4 0.72606498 <a title="369-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data to make predictions.  However, people disagree to some extent about what this means.  One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is “tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction” and the other extreme is “tools to do prediction with no human intervention”.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.
  
 
 Human Necessary 
  
 Human partially necessary 
  
 Human unnecessary 
 
 
 Clustering, data visualization 
 Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical Models 
 Kernel Learning (SVM’s, etc..) 
 Decision Trees? 
 Reinforcement Learning 
 
  
The exact position of each element is of course debatable.  My reasoning is that clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a human in the loop.  Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally require a human to sit and think about what</p><p>6 0.67182446 <a title="369-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>

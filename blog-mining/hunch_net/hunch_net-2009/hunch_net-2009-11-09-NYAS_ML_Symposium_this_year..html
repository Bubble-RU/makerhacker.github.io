<p>Introduction: TheNew York ML symposiumwas last Friday. Attendance was 268, significantly
larger thanlast year. My impression was that the event mostly still fit the
space, although it was crowded. If anyone has suggestions for next year, speak
up.The best student paper award went toSergiu Goschinfor a cool video of how
his system learned to play video games (I can't find the paper online yet).
Choosing amongst the submitted talks was pretty difficult this year, as there
were many similarly good ones.By coincidence all the invited talks were (at
least potentially) about faster learning algorithms.Stephen Boydtalked
aboutADMM.Leon Bottouspoke on single pass online learning viaaveraged SGD.Yoav
Freundtalked aboutparameter-free hedging. In Yoav's case the talk was mostly
about a better theoretical learning algorithm, but it has the potential to
unlock an exponential computational complexity improvement via oraclization of
experts algorithmsâ&euro;Ś but some serious thought needs to go in this

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>5 0.11078061 <a title="377-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-28-NY_ML_Symposium_2010.html">415 hunch net-2010-10-28-NY ML Symposium 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is

<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style
presentation format (i.</p><p>3 0.52184343 <a title="377-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>3 0.8612622 <a title="377-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-A_COLT_paper.html">85 hunch net-2005-06-28-A COLT paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found Tong Zhang's paper onData Dependent Concentration Bounds for
Sequential Prediction Algorithmsinteresting. Roughly speaking, it states a
tight bound on the future error rate for online learning algorithms assuming
that samples are drawn independently. This bound is easily computed and will
make the progressive validation approaches usedheresignificantly more
practical.</p><p>4 0.83238733 <a title="377-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-16-Regularization_%3D_Robustness.html">185 hunch net-2006-06-16-Regularization = Robustness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>5 0.70778036 <a title="377-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-03-Bidding_Problems.html">315 hunch net-2008-09-03-Bidding Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>6 0.56558931 <a title="377-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>

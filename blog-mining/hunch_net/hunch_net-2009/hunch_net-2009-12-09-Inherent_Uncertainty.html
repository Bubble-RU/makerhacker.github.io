<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This

<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: "Was it
helpful for research?"Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.Some evidence is
provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper
ideas than I've ever previously been. It is always hard to estimate
counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than
"What if I had not started the blog?"As for "Why?", there seem to be two
primary effects.A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either
think like you or are interested in the same problems. This allows for
concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems.The
process of stating things you don't understand publicly is very helpful in
understanding them. Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way
which aids understanding. Sometimes someone else says something which helps.
And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the
problem.There are drawbacks which shou</p><p>5 0.60604274 <a title="383-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a
problem, letting the world know is helpful. This isn't necessarily because the
world will help you s</p><p>6 0.57970667 <a title="383-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-10-Thoughts_on_Artificial_Intelligence.html">486 hunch net-2013-07-10-Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An amusing tidbit (reproduced without permission) from Herman Chernoff's
delightful monograph, "Sequential analysis and optimal design":The use of
randomization raises a philosophical question which is articulated by the
following probably apocryphal anecdote.The metallurgist told his friend the
statistician how he planned to test the effect of heat on the strength of a
metal bar by sawing the bar into six pieces. The first two would go into the
hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool
oven. The statistician, horrified, explained how he should randomize to avoid
the effect of a possible gradient of strength in the metal bar. The method of
randomization was applied, and it turned out that the randomized experiment
called for putting the first two pieces into the hot oven, the next two into
the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. "Obviously, we can't do
that," said the metallurgist. "On the contrary, you have to do that," said the
statisti</p><p>4 0.7782855 <a title="383-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-19-NIPS_Workshops.html">113 hunch net-2005-09-19-NIPS Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attendance at theNIPS workshopsis highly recommended for both research and

workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of

LearningMachine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured EnvironmentsThere
aremanymore workshops. In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible
anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in. Maybe in future years
the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap.Many of
these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>5 0.75397861 <a title="383-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-01-The_Role_of_Impromptu_Talks.html">88 hunch net-2005-07-01-The Role of Impromptu Talks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLThad an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting
than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).
There are several roles that an impromptu session can play
including:Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen
now rather than later helps aid the process of research.Discussing a paper
that was rejected. Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a
means to remedy that.Entertainment. We all like to have a bit of fun.For
design, the following seem important:Impromptu speakers should not have much
time. At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well.The entire
impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and
promotes restlessness. A half hour or hour can work well.Impromptu talks are a
mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule. They will be chaotic
in content, presentation, and usefulness. The fundamental advantage of this
chaos is that it provid</p><p>6 0.59156942 <a title="383-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>

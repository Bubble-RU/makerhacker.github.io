<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

<p>Introduction: A loss function is some function which, for any example, takes a prediction
and the correct prediction, and determines how much loss is incurred. (People
sometimes attempt to optimize functions of more than one example such as "area
under the ROC curve" or "harmonic mean of precision and recall".) Typically we
try to find predictors that minimize loss.There seems to be a strong dichotomy
between two views of what "loss" means in learning.Loss is determined by the
problem.Loss is a part of the specification of the learning problem. Examples
of problems specified by the loss function include "binary classification",
"multiclass classification", "importance weighted classification",
"l2regression", etcâ&euro;Ś This is the decision theory view of what loss means, and
the view that I prefer.Loss is determined by the solution.To solve a problem,
you optimize some particular loss functionnotgiven by the problem. Examples of
these loss functions are "hinge loss" (for SVMs), "log loss" (common in

<p>Introduction: Some loss functions have a meaning, which can be understood in a manner
independent of the loss function itself.Optimizing squared
losslsq(y,y')=(y-y')2means predicting the (conditional) mean ofy.Optimizing
absolute value losslav(y,y')=|y-y'|means predicting the (conditional) median
ofy. Variants canhandle other quantiles. 0/1 loss for classification is a
special case.Optimizing log lossllog(y,y')=log (1/Prz~y'(z=y))means minimizing
the description length ofy.The semantics (= meaning) of the loss are made
explicit by a theorem in each case. For squared loss, we can prove a theorem
of the form:For all distributionsDoverY, ify' = arg miny'Ey ~ Dlsq(y,y')theny'
= Ey~DySimilar theorems hold for the other examples above, and they can all be
extended to predictors ofy'for distributionsDover a contextXand a valueY.There

<p>Introduction: Halasksa very good question: "When is the right time to insert the loss
function?" In particular, should it be used at testing time or at training
time?When the world imposes a loss on us, the standard Bayesian recipe is to
predict the (conditional) probability of each possibility and then choose the
possibility which minimizes the expected loss. In contrast, as
theconfusionover "loss = money lost" or "loss = the thing you optimize" might
indicate, many people ignore the Bayesian approach and simply optimize their
loss (or a close proxy for their loss) over the representation on the training
set.The best answer I can give is "it's unclear, but I prefer optimizing the
loss at training time". My experience is that optimizing the loss in the most
direct manner possible typically yields best performance. This question is
related to a basic principle which bothYann LeCun(applied) andVladimir

<p>Introduction: I attendedALT("Algorithmic Learning Theory") for the first time this year. My
impression is ALT = 0.5 COLT, by attendance and also by some more intangible
"what do I get from it?" measure. There are many differences which can't quite
be described this way though. The program for ALT seems to be substantially
more diverse than COLT, which is both a weakness and a strength.One paper that
might interest people generally is:Alexey ChernovandVladimir Vovk,Prediction
with Expert Evaluators' Advice. The basic observation here is that in the
online learning with experts setting you can simultaneously compete with
several compatible loss functions simultaneously. Restated, debating between
competing with log loss and squared loss is a waste of breath, because it's
almost free to compete with them both simultaneously. This might interest
anyone who has run into "which loss function?" debates that come up
periodically.</p><p>2 0.82121539 <a title="374-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-27-The_Peekaboom_Dataset.html">159 hunch net-2006-02-27-The Peekaboom Dataset</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn'sPeekaboom projecthas yieldeddata(830MB).Peekaboom is the second
attempt (afterEspgame) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to
solve vision problems based on voluntary game play. As a second attempt, it is
meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt. In
particular:The locations of specific objects are provided by the data.The data
collection is far more complete and extensive.The data consists of:The source
images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.)The in-game events. (1
file per image, in a lispy syntax.)A description of the event language.There
is a great deal of very specific and relevant data here so the hope that this
will help solve vision problems seems quite reasonable.</p><p>3 0.77830589 <a title="374-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-02-16-Metacademy%3A_a_package_manager_for_knowledge.html">493 hunch net-2014-02-16-Metacademy: a package manager for knowledge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that
make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of
people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for
the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise,
sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online
lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a
knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field,
how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where
should you learn them?Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational
materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to
be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also,
unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning
goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we

<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>5 0.597417 <a title="374-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-10-%26%238220%3BFailure%26%238221%3B_is_an_option.html">110 hunch net-2005-09-10-&#8220;Failure&#8221; is an option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.The cultural
definition of success in academic research is to:Produce good research which
many other people appreciate.Produce many students who go on to do the
same.There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.
Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs. Many students
succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think
in a similar way and appreciate your work.In order to graduate, a phd student
must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common
to adopt the culture's definition of success during this time. It's also
common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic
research lifestyle. This collision of values and abilities naturally results
in depression.The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change
something. Pick a new advisor. Pick a new research topic. Or leave the program

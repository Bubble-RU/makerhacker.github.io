<p>Introduction: One conventional wisdom is that learning algorithms with linear
representations are sufficient to solve natural learning problems. This
conventional wisdom appears unsupported by empirical evidence as far as I can
tell. In nearly all vision, language, robotics, and speech applications I know
where machine learning is effectively applied, the approach involves either a
linear representation on hand crafted features capturing substantial
nonlinearities or learning directly on nonlinear representations.There are a
few exceptions to this--for example, if the problem of interest to you is
predicting the next word given previous words, n-gram methods have been shown
effective. Viewed the right way, n-gram methods are essentially linear
predictors on an enormous sparse feature space, learned from an enormous
number of examples. Hal's postheredescribes some of this in more detail.In
contrast, if you go to a machine learning conference, a large number of the
new algorithms are variations of lea</p><p>3 0.16029814 <a title="359-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-24-Specializations_of_the_Master_Problem.html">388 hunch net-2010-01-24-Specializations of the Master Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single
master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.
This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where
the world interacts with an agent as:The world announces an observationx.The
agent makes a choicea.The world announces a rewardr.The goal here is to
maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent. No particular
structure relatingxtoaoratoris implied by this setting so we do not know
effective general algorithms for the agent. It's very easy to prove lower
bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here--just consider the
case where actions are unrelated to rewards. Nevertheless, there is a real
sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this
setting, somehow succeeding. The gap between these observations drives
research--How can we find tractable specializations of the master problem

<p>Introduction: Muthuinvited me to the workshop onalgorithms in the field, with the goal of
providing a sense of where near-term research should go. When the time came
though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other
people to comment.There are several things I didn't fully understand when I
went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago. I'd like to repeat them as people in
academia may not yet understand them intuitively.Almost all the big impact
algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time. Think about caching,
hashing, sorting, filtering, etcâ&euro;Ś and you have a sense of what some of the
most heavily used algorithms are. This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning
research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and
languages. Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where
inference is often a superlinear operation--think about then2dependence on the

<p>Introduction: Machine learning has a new kind of "scaling to larger problems" to worry
about: scaling with the amount of contextual information. The standard
development path for a machine learning application in practice seems to be
the following:Marginal. In the beginning, there was "majority vote". At this
stage, it isn't necessary to understand that you have a prediction problem.
People just realize that one answer is right sometimes and another answer
other times. In machine learning terms, this corresponds to making a
prediction without side information.First context. A clever person realizes
that some bit of informationx1could be helpful. Ifx1is discrete, they
condition on it and make a predictorh(x1), typically by counting. If they are
clever, then they also do some smoothing. Ifx1is some real valued parameter,
it's very common to make a threshold cutoff. Often, these tasks are simply
done by hand.Second. Another clever person (or perhaps the same one) realizes

<p>Introduction: This post is about a trick that I learned fromDale Schuurmanswhich has been
repeatedly useful for me over time.The basic trick has to do with importance
weighting for monte carlo integration. Consider the problem of finding:N = Ex
~ Df(x)given samples fromDand knowledge off.Often, we don't have samples
fromDavailable. Instead, we must make do with samples from some other
distributionQ. In that case, we can still often solve the problem, as long as
Q(x) isn't 0 when D(x) is nonzero, using the importance weighting formula:Ex ~
Qf(x) D(x)/Q(x)A basic question is: How many samples fromQare required in
order to estimateNto some precision? In general the convergence rate is not
bounded, becausef(x) D(x)/Q(x)is not bounded given the
assumptions.Nevertheless, there is one special valueQ(x) = f(x) D(x) / Nwhere
the sample complexity turns out to be1, which is typically substantially
better than the sample complexity of the original problem.This observation

<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>6 0.62905836 <a title="359-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-05-What_is_state%3F.html">169 hunch net-2006-04-05-What is state?</a></p>

Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models. A number of people are aware of it,
but it seems that not everyone is.Several learning systems have the property
that they estimate some conditional probabilitiesP(event | other events)either
explicitly or implicitly. Then, at prediction time, these learned
probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a
final prediction. The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest
of these, so it seems like a good example.When Naive Bayes is used, a set of
probabilities of the formPr'(feature i | label)are estimated via counting
statistics and some prior. Predictions are made according to the label
maximizing:Pr'(label) * Productfeatures iPr'(feature i | label)(ThePr'notation
indicates these are estimated values.)There is nothing wrong with this method
as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is very strong and (b) the
prior (on the c</p><p>2 0.95809639 <a title="359-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-28-NY_ML_Symposium_2010.html">415 hunch net-2010-10-28-NY ML Symposium 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>3 0.94905925 <a title="359-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the "right" way to do
machine learning. This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.
The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a
reply2.The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and
general. Essentially, you first specify a priorP(D)over possible
processesDproducing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data
according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)After
this, hard decisions are made (such as "turn left" or "turn right") by
choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior)
loss.This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices
ofP(D)and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice
properties:There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual
distribution generating the data is drawn fromP(D)there is no better method.
One way to think about this is that in</p><p>4 0.93790519 <a title="359-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-02-Proprietary_Data_in_Academic_Research%3F.html">306 hunch net-2008-07-02-Proprietary Data in Academic Research?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should results of experiments on proprietary datasets be in the academic
research literature?The arguments I can imagine in the "against" column
are:Experiments are not repeatable. Repeatability in experiments is essential
to science because it allows others to compare new methods with old and
discover which is better.It's unfair. Academics who don't have insider access
to proprietary data are at a substantial disadvantage when competing with
others who do.I'm unsympathetic to argument (2). To me, it looks like their
are simply some resource constraints, and these should not prevent research
progress. For example, we wouldn't prevent publishing about particle
accelerator experiments by physicists atCERNbecause physicists atCMUcouldn't
run their own experiments.Argument (1) seems like a real issue.The argument
for is:Yes, they are another form of evidence that an algorithm is good. The
degree to which they are evidence is less than for publicly repeatable
experiments, but greater than n</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92202586 <a title="359-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-03-Functionally_defined_Nonlinear_Dynamic_Models.html">359 hunch net-2009-06-03-Functionally defined Nonlinear Dynamic Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose we have a set of observations over timex1,x2,…,xtand want to predict
some future eventyt+1. An inevitable problem arises, because learning a
predictorh(x1,…,xt)ofyt+1is generically intractable due to the size of the
input. To make this problem tractable, what's necessary is a method for
summarizing the relevant information in past observations for the purpose of
prediction in the future. In other words, state is required.Existing
approaches for deriving state have some limitations.Hidden Markov
modelslearned with EM suffer from local minima, use tabular learning
approaches which provide dubious generalization ability, and often require
substantial a.priori specification of the observations.Kalman
FiltersandParticle Filtersare very parametric in the sense that substantial
information must be specified up front.Dynamic Bayesian Networks (graphical
modelsthrough time) require substantial a.priori specification and often

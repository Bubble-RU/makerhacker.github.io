<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.BackgroundA
reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible
(Bayes) error rateb, we get a regretr = e - b. ThePECOC(Probabilistic Error
Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regretrimplies
multiclass regret at most4r0.5.The problemThis is not the "rightest" answer.
Consider thek=2case, where we reduce binary to binary. There exists a
reduction (the identity) with the property that regretrimplies regretr. This
is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which
suggests that a better reduction may exist for generalk. For example, we can
not rule out the possibility that a reductionRexists with regret transform
guaranteeing binary regretrimp</p><p>3 0.68582171 <a title="375-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-11-26-Giving_Thanks.html">449 hunch net-2011-11-26-Giving Thanks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>4 0.59665096 <a title="375-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheExponentiated Gradientalgorithm byManfred WarmuthandJyrki Kivinencame out
just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference
and in class. It's a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical
statement accompanying it.The essential statement holds in the "online
learning with an adversary" setting. Initially, there are of set ofnweights,
which might have values(1/n,â&euro;Ś,1/n), (or any other values from a probability
distribution). Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion. On each round,
the following happens:The world reveals a set of featuresx in {0,1}n. In the
online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called
"experts" and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn't
necessary--you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature
value and the negation of the feature value as two experts).EG makes a
prediction according toy' = w . x(dot product).The world reveals the truthy in
[0,1].EG updates the weights</p><p>5 0.58826578 <a title="375-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-22-Exemplar_programming.html">215 hunch net-2006-10-22-Exemplar programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many different abstractions for problem definition and solution.
Here are a few examples:Functional programming: a set of functions are
defined. The composed execution of these functions yields the solution.Linear
programming: a set of constraints and a linear objective function are defined.
An LP solver finds the constrained optimum.Quadratic programming: Like linear
programming, but the language is a little more flexible (and the solution
slower).Convex programming: like quadratic programming, but the language is
more flexible (and the solutions even slower).Dynamic programming: a recursive
definition of the problem is defined and then solved efficiently via caching
tricks.SAT programming: A problem is specified as a satisfiability involving a
conjunction of a disjunction of boolean variables. A general engine attempts
to find a good satisfying assignment. For exampleKautz'sblackboxplanner.These
abstractions have different tradeoffs between ease of use, generality, and the</p><p>6 0.58020657 <a title="375-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-10-Learning_Reductions_are_Reductionist.html">68 hunch net-2005-05-10-Learning Reductions are Reductionist</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just releasedVowpal Wabbit 6.0. Since the last version:VW is now 2-3 orders
of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks toAlekh. Given the
baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature
datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects. The core
improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters
(eitherHadoopor not). This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with
clusters of size 2 (and doesn't hurt for clusters of size 1). The core
allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused--we've already used it to
parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.
We'll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now
"README_cluster" and associated scripts should provide a good starting

<p>Introduction: We are releasing theVowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) codeas open source
under a BSD (revised) license. This is aproject at Yahoo! Researchto build a
useful large scale learning algorithm whichLihong Li,Alex Strehl, and I have
been working on.To appreciate the meaning of "large", it's useful to define
"small" and "medium". A "small" supervised learning problem is one where a
human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor. A
"medium" supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern
desktop computer. A "large" supervised learning problem is one which does not
fit into the RAM of a normal machine. VW tackles large scale learning problems
by this definition of large. I'm not aware of any other open source Machine
Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist). A few
close ones are:IBM's Parallel Machine Learning Toolboxisn't quite open source.
The approach used by this toolbox is essentially map-reduce style computation,</p><p>4 0.15615465 <a title="365-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-16-Optimizing_Machine_Learning_Programs.html">262 hunch net-2007-09-16-Optimizing Machine Learning Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the
ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a
machine learning algorithm. Basic tactical optimizations are covered
wellelsewhere, but I haven't seen a reasonable guide to higher level
optimizations, which are the most important in my experience. Here are some of
the higher level optimizations I've often found useful.Algorithmic Improvement
First. This is Hard, but it is the most important consideration, and typically
yields the most benefits. Good optimizations here are publishable. In the
context of machine learning, you should be familiar with the arguments for
online vs. batch learning.Choice of Language. There are many arguments about
thechoice of language. Sometimes you don't have a choice when interfacing with
other people. Personally, I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code. This
(admittedly) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher level
languages. (Sometimes</p><p>5 0.15017292 <a title="365-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At NIPS,Andrew Ngasked me what should be in a large scale learning class.
After some discussion with him andNandoand mulling it over a bit, these are
the topics that I think should be covered.There are many different kinds of
scaling.Scaling in examplesThis is the most basic kind of scaling.Online
Gradient DescentThis is an old algorithm--I'm not sure if anyone can be
credited with it in particular. Perhaps thePerceptronis a good precursor, but
substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of
whichsquared loss,logistic loss, Hinge Loss, andQuantile Lossare all worth
covering. It's important to cover thesemanticsof these loss functions as
well.Vowpal Wabbitis a reasonably fast codebase implementing these.Second
Order Gradient Descent methodsFor some problems, methods taking into account
second derivative information can be more effective. I've seen preconditioned
conjugate gradient work well, for whichJonathan Shewchuck'swriteupis
reasonable. Nando likesL-BFGSwhich I</p><p>6 0.14511052 <a title="365-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-14-MLcomp%3A_a_website_for_objectively_comparing_ML_algorithms.html">393 hunch net-2010-04-14-MLcomp: a website for objectively comparing ML algorithms</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>5 0.71279013 <a title="365-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-06-22-Ultra_LDA.html">436 hunch net-2011-06-22-Ultra LDA</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lev Reyzinpoints out theCI Fellows program is renewed. CI Fellows are
essentiallyNSFfunded computer science postdocs for universities and industry
research labs. I've been lucky and happy to have Lev visit me for a year
underlast year's program, so I strongly recommend participating if it suits
you.As with last year, the application timeline is very short, with everything
due by May 23.</p><p>2 0.92914838 <a title="365-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'd like to point outInherent Uncertainty, which I've added to the ML blog
post scanner on the right. My understanding fromJakeis that the intention is
to have a multiauthor blog which is more specialized towards learning
theory/game theory than this one. Nevertheless, several of the posts seem to
be of wider interest.</p><p>3 0.88794553 <a title="365-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-19-NIPS_Workshops.html">113 hunch net-2005-09-19-NIPS Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attendance at theNIPS workshopsis highly recommended for both research and
learning. Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of
workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of
interest:Machine Learning in FinanceLearning to RankFoundations of Active
LearningMachine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured EnvironmentsThere
aremanymore workshops. In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible
anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in. Maybe in future years
the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap.Many of
these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>4 0.87344635 <a title="365-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-07-Objective_and_subjective_interpretations_of_probability.html">205 hunch net-2006-09-07-Objective and subjective interpretations of probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An amusing tidbit (reproduced without permission) from Herman Chernoff's
delightful monograph, "Sequential analysis and optimal design":The use of
randomization raises a philosophical question which is articulated by the
following probably apocryphal anecdote.The metallurgist told his friend the
statistician how he planned to test the effect of heat on the strength of a
metal bar by sawing the bar into six pieces. The first two would go into the
hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool
oven. The statistician, horrified, explained how he should randomize to avoid
the effect of a possible gradient of strength in the metal bar. The method of
randomization was applied, and it turned out that the randomized experiment
called for putting the first two pieces into the hot oven, the next two into
the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. "Obviously, we can't do
that," said the metallurgist. "On the contrary, you have to do that," said the
statisti</p><p>5 0.8136701 <a title="365-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-01-The_Role_of_Impromptu_Talks.html">88 hunch net-2005-07-01-The Role of Impromptu Talks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLThad an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting
than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).
There are several roles that an impromptu session can play
including:Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen
now rather than later helps aid the process of research.Discussing a paper
that was rejected. Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a
means to remedy that.Entertainment. We all like to have a bit of fun.For
design, the following seem important:Impromptu speakers should not have much
time. At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well.The entire
impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and
promotes restlessness. A half hour or hour can work well.Impromptu talks are a
mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule. They will be chaotic
in content, presentation, and usefulness. The fundamental advantage of this
chaos is that it provid</p><p>same-blog 6 0.80227852 <a title="365-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>

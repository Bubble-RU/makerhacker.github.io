<p>Introduction: We are releasing the  Vowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) code  as open source under a BSD (revised) license.  This is a  project at Yahoo! Research  to build a useful large scale learning algorithm which  Lihong Li ,  Alex Strehl , and I have been working on.
 
To appreciate the meaning of “large”, it’s useful to define “small” and “medium”.  A “small” supervised learning problem is one where a human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor.  A “medium” supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern desktop computer.  A “large” supervised learning problem is one which does not fit into the RAM of a normal machine.  VW tackles large scale learning problems by this definition of large.  I’m not aware of any other open source Machine Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist).  A few close ones are:

<p>Introduction: I just released  Vowpal Wabbit 6.0 .  Since the last version:
  
 VW is now 2-3 orders of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks to  Alekh .  Given the baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects.  The core improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters (either  Hadoop  or not).   This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with clusters of size 2 (and doesn’t hurt for clusters of size 1).  The core allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused—we’ve already used it to parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.  We’ll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now “README_cluster” and associated scripts should provide a good starting point.
 
 The new  LBFGS  code from  Miro  seems to commonly dominate the existing conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.

<p>Introduction: At NIPS,  Andrew Ng  asked me what should be in a large scale learning class.  After some discussion with him and  Nando  and mulling it over a bit, these are the topics that I think should be covered.
 
There are many different kinds of scaling.
  
  Scaling in examples   This is the most basic kind of scaling.
 
  Online Gradient Descent  This is an old algorithm—I’m not sure if anyone can be credited with it in particular.  Perhaps the  Perceptron  is a good precursor, but substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of which  squared loss ,  logistic loss , Hinge Loss, and  Quantile Loss  are all worth covering.  It’s important to cover the  semantics  of these loss functions as well.   Vowpal Wabbit  is a reasonably fast codebase implementing these. 
  Second Order Gradient Descent methods  For some problems, methods taking into account second derivative information can be more effective.  I’ve seen preconditioned conjugate gradient work well, for which  Jonath</p><p>5 0.15375407 <a title="365-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-16-Optimizing_Machine_Learning_Programs.html">262 hunch net-2007-09-16-Optimizing Machine Learning Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a machine learning algorithm.  Basic tactical optimizations are covered well  elsewhere , but I haven’t seen a reasonable guide to higher level optimizations, which are the most important in my experience.  Here are some of the higher level optimizations I’ve often found useful.
  
  Algorithmic Improvement First . This is Hard, but it is the most important consideration, and typically yields the most benefits.  Good optimizations here are publishable.  In the context of machine learning, you should be familiar with the arguments for online vs. batch learning. 
  Choice of Language . There are many arguments about the  choice of language .  Sometimes you don’t have a choice when interfacing with other people.  Personally, I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code.  This (admittedly) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher lev</p><p>6 0.14475438 <a title="365-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-13-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_6.1_%26%23038%3B_the_NIPS_tutorial.html">451 hunch net-2011-12-13-Vowpal Wabbit version 6.1 &#038; the NIPS tutorial</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve released  version 5.0  of the  Vowpal Wabbit  online learning software.  The major number has changed since the  last release  because I regard all earlier versions as obsolete—there are several new algorithms & features including substantial changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.  
 
The biggest changes are new algorithms:
  
  Nikos  and I improved the default algorithm.  The basic update rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully controlled so that it’s impossible to overrun the label.  In addition, the normalization has changed.  Computationally, these changes are virtually free and yield better results, sometimes much better.  Less careful updates can be reenabled with –loss_function classic, although results are still not identical to previous due to normalization changes. 
 Nikos also implemented the per-feature learning rates as per these  two   papers .  Often, this works better than the default algorithm.  It isn’t the defa</p><p>4 0.7513895 <a title="365-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-06-22-Ultra_LDA.html">436 hunch net-2011-06-22-Ultra LDA</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers that I found surprisingly interesting.
  
  Yoshua Bengio , Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici, Hugo Larochelle,  Greedy Layer-wise Training of Deep Networks . Empirically investigates some of the design choices behind deep belief networks.
 
  Long Zhu , Yuanhao Chen,  Alan Yuille  Unsupervised Learning of a Probabilistic Grammar for Object Detection and Parsing.  An unsupervised method for detecting objects using simple feature filters that works remarkably well on the (supervised)  caltech-101 dataset . 
  Shai Ben-David ,  John Blitzer ,  Koby Crammer , and  Fernando Pereira ,  Analysis of Representations for Domain Adaptation .  This is the first analysis I’ve seen of learning with respect to samples drawn differently from the evaluation distribution which depends on reasonable measurable quantities. 
  
All of these papers turn out to have a common theme—the power of unlabeled data to do generically useful things.</p><p>2 0.90538055 <a title="365-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-13-Site_tweak.html">122 hunch net-2005-10-13-Site tweak</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today brings a new release of the  Vowpal Wabbit  fast online learning software.  This time, unlike the previous release, the project itself is going open source, developing via  github .  For example, the lastest and greatest can be downloaded via:
  
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
  
If you aren’t familiar with  git , it’s a distributed version control system which supports quick and easy branching, as well as reconciliation.
 
This version of the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of OSX as well as Linux boxes.
 
As much of the point of this project is pushing the limits of fast and effective machine learning, let me mention a few datapoints from my experience.
  
 The program can effectively scale up to batch-style training on sparse terafeature (i.e. 10 12  sparse feature) size datasets.  The limiting factor is typically i/o.

<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this discussion about a  fast physics simulator  chip interesting from a learning viewpoint.  In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical processes.  Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite helpful in predicting the outcome.  Bayesian learning in particular may directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines) might have their speed greatly increased.
 
The biggest drawback is that writing software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming, but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.77934223 <a title="365-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-02-Asymmophobia.html">348 hunch net-2009-04-02-Asymmophobia</a></p>

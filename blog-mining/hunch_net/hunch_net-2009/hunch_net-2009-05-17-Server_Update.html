<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:Updating
toWordPress1.5.Installing and heavily tweaking theGeeknichetheme. Update: I
switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme.Adding theCustomizable
Post Listingsplugin.Installing theStatTraqplugin.Updating some of the links. I
particularly recommend looking at thecomputer research
policyblog.Addingthreaded comments. This doesn't thread old comments
obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones.Overall, I
think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of myearlier problems. If
you have any difficulties or anything seems "not quite right", please speak
up. A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>3 0.14903449 <a title="354-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the
latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please
comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be
complete.)More generally, this is a good time to ask for suggestions. What
would make this blog more useful?</p><p>4 0.12492974 <a title="354-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>5 0.10409539 <a title="354-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-06-20-2010_ICML_discussion_site.html">401 hunch net-2010-06-20-2010 ICML discussion site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A substantial difficulty with the 2009 and 2008ICML discussion systemwas a
communication vacuum, where authors were not informed of comments, and
commenters were not informed of responses to their comments without explicit
monitoring.Mark Reidhas setup anew discussion system for 2010with the goal of
addressing this.Mark didn't want to make it to intrusive, so you must opt-in.
As an author,find your paperand "Subscribe by email" to the comments. As a
commenter, you have the option of providing an email for follow-up
notification.</p><p>6 0.091512561 <a title="354-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-13-Site_tweak.html">122 hunch net-2005-10-13-Site tweak</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Luishas releasedPeekabooma successor toESPgame(game site). The purpose of the
game is similar--using the actions of people playing a game to gather data
helpful in solving AI.Peekaboom gathers more detailed, and perhaps more
useful, data about vision. For ESPgame, the byproduct of the game was mutually
agreed upon labels for common images. For Peekaboom, the location of the
subimage generating the label is revealed by the game as well. Given knowledge
about what portion of the image is related to a label it may be more feasible
learn to recognize the appropriate parts.There isn't a dataset yet available
for this game as there is for ESPgame, but hopefully a significant number of
people will play and we'll have one to work wtih soon.</p><p>3 0.5055126 <a title="354-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-22-KDD_2010.html">406 hunch net-2010-08-22-KDD 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane

<p>Introduction: David Mcallestergave a talk about thispaper(withPedro Felzenszwalb). I'll try
to give a high level summary of why it's interesting.Dynamic programming is
most familiar as instantiated by Viterbi decoding in a hidden markov model. It
is a general paradigm for problem solving where subproblems are solved and
used to solve larger problems. In the Viterbi decoding example, the subproblem
is "What is the most probable path ending at each state at timestept?", and
the larger problem is the same except at timestept+1. There are a few
optimizations you can do here:Dynamic Programming -> queued Dynamic
Programming. Keep track of the "cost so far" (or "most probable path") and
(carefully) only look at extensions to paths likely to yield the shortest
path. "Carefully" here is defined byDijkstra's shortest path algorithm.queued
Dynamic programming -> A*Add a lower bound on the cost to complete a path (or
an upper bound on the probability of a completion) for the priority queue of

<p>Introduction: and I can't help but remember him.I first metSamas an undergraduate
atCaltechwhere he was TA forHopfield's class, and again when I visitedGatsby,
when he invited me to visitToronto, and at too many conferences to recount.
His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great
ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

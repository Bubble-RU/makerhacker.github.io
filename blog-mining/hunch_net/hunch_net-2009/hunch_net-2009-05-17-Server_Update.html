<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround.

<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:
  
 Updating to  WordPress  1.5. 
 Installing and heavily tweaking the  Geekniche  theme.  Update: I switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme. 
 Adding the  Customizable Post Listings  plugin. 
 Installing the  StatTraq  plugin. 
 Updating some of the links.  I particularly recommend looking at the  computer research policy  blog. 
 Adding  threaded comments .  This doesn’t thread old comments obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones. 
  
Overall, I think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of my  earlier problems .  If you have any difficulties or anything seems “not quite right”, please speak up.  A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>3 0.14133656 <a title="354-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be complete.) 
More generally, this is a good time to ask for suggestions.  What would make this blog more useful?</p><p>4 0.12660706 <a title="354-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-issues for the moment.
 
The number of posts is a bit over 20. 
The number of people speaking up in discussions is about 10. 
The number of people viewing the site is somewhat more than 100.
 
I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many things.
  
 Many of the  potential uses  haven’t been realized.  This is partly a matter of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no open problems because it’s hard to give them up), and partly a matter of tradition.  In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get everything perfectly right before presentation.  This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.  If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to continue experimenting, I’m going to use the next week as “open problems we</p><p>5 0.10272529 <a title="354-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-06-20-2010_ICML_discussion_site.html">401 hunch net-2010-06-20-2010 ICML discussion site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A substantial difficulty with the 2009 and 2008  ICML discussion system  was a communication vacuum, where authors were not informed of comments, and commenters were not informed of responses to their comments without explicit monitoring.   Mark Reid  has setup a  new discussion system for 2010  with the goal of addressing this.
 
Mark didn’t want to make it to intrusive, so you must opt-in.  As an author,  find your paper  and “Subscribe by email” to the comments.  As a commenter, you have the option of providing an email for follow-up notification.</p><p>6 0.095371373 <a title="354-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the  last ICML ,  Tom Dietterich  asked me to look into systems for commenting on papers.  I’ve been slow getting to this, but it’s relevant now.
 
The essential observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they are not yet much used in academic research.  If we can find the right way to use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the first conference that manages to really create an online community.  Various conferences have been poking at this.  For example,  UAI has setup a wiki , COLT has  started using   Joomla , with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting up a “ student blog “.  Similarly,  Dinoj Surendran  setup a twiki for the  Chicago Machine Learning Summer School , which was quite useful for coordinating events and other things.
 
I believe the most important thing is a willingness to experiment.  A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference websites.  For example, the  ICML 2007 papers pag</p><p>6 0.53315711 <a title="354-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-Blog_compromised.html">294 hunch net-2008-04-12-Blog compromised</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing  (CS) is a new framework developed by  Emmanuel Candes ,  Terry Tao  and  David Donoho . To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the growing subject:  http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/  ]

<p>Introduction: At an intuitive level, the question here is “Can reinforcement learning be solved with classification?”  
 
 Problem  Construct a reinforcement learning algorithm with near-optimal expected sum of rewards in the  direct experience model  given access to a classifier learning algorithm which has a small error rate or regret on all posed classification problems.  The definition of “posed” here is slightly murky.  I consider a problem “posed” if there is an algorithm for constructing labeled classification examples.
 
 Past Work 
  
 There exists a  reduction of reinforcement learning to classification given a generative model.   A generative model is an inherently stronger assumption than the direct experience model. 
 Other  work on learning reductions  may be important. 
 Several algorithms for solving reinforcement learning in the direct experience model exist.  Most, such as  E 3  ,  Factored-E 3  , and  metric-E 3   and  Rmax  require that the observation be the state.

<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and stick with it.  For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not enough: they must design new notations for new problems.  The design of good notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a line of research greatly.  
 
Before we had mathematical notation, equations were all written out in language.  Since words have multiple meanings and variable precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous.  A good representative example of this is the legalese in the tax code.  Since we want greater precision and clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.
 
One fundamental thing to understand about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely capable.  This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better than another.  This observation is easier to miss than you might</p><p>6 0.57789266 <a title="354-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>

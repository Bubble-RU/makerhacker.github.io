</p><p>4 To improve, it crafts a virus that takes over most of the world’s computers using it as a surveillance network so that it can always make the right decision. [sent-7, score-0.196]
</p><p>5 The AI also branches out into any form of distance work, taking over the entire outsourcing process for all jobs that are entirely digital. [sent-8, score-0.126]
</p><p>6 Robot cars and construction teams complete the process, so that any human with money can order anything cheaply and quickly, but no jobs remain for humans. [sent-10, score-0.244]
</p><p>7 At this point, the AI is stuck—it can eventually extract all the money from the economic system, and that’s all there is. [sent-11, score-0.174]
</p><p>8 It simply funds appropriate political campaigns so that in some country a measure passes granting the AI the right to make money, which it promptly does, mushrooming it’s wealth from trillions to the maximum number representable in all computers simultaneously. [sent-13, score-0.448]
</p><p>9 To remove this obstacle, the AI promptly starts making more computers on a worldwide scale until all available power sources are used up. [sent-14, score-0.428]
</p><p>10 To add more power, the AI starts a space program with beamed power. [sent-15, score-0.281]
</p><p>11 Unfortunately, it finds the pesky atmosphere an obstacle to space travel, so it chemically binds the atmosphere in the crust of the earth allowing many  Gauss Guns  to efficiently project material into space where  solar sails  are used for orbital positioning. [sent-16, score-1.033]
</p><p>12 This process continues, slowed perhaps by the need to cool the Earth’s core, until the earth and other viable rocky bodies in the solar system are discorporated into a  Dyson sphere . [sent-17, score-0.392]
</p><p>13 Then, the AI goes interstellar with the same program. [sent-18, score-0.158]
</p><p>14 Somewhere in this process, certainly by the time the atmosphere is chemically bound, all life on earth (except the AI if you count it) is extinct. [sent-19, score-0.436]
</p><p>15 One element of understanding AI safety seems to be understanding what an AI could do. [sent-21, score-0.15]
</p><p>16 The general problem is related to the wish problem: How do you specify a wish in a manner so that it can’t be misinterpreted? [sent-25, score-0.255]
</p><p>17 Applied to AI, this approach also has limits because any limit imposed by a person can and eventually will be removed by a person given sufficient opportunity. [sent-27, score-0.277]
</p><p>18 Applied to AI, the idea would be that we make many AIs programmed to behave well either via laws or wish tricks, with an additional element of aggressively enforcing this behavior in other AIs. [sent-31, score-0.571]
</p><p>19 Furthermore, the default must be that AIs are programmed to not harm or cause harm to humans, enforcing that behavior in other AIs. [sent-35, score-0.439]
</p><p>20 Getting the programming right is the hard part, and I’m not clear on how viable this is, or how difficult it is compared to simply creating an AI, which of course I haven’t managed. [sent-36, score-0.178]

<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>3 0.28121743 <a title="380-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-06-Machine_Learning_to_AI.html">352 hunch net-2009-05-06-Machine Learning to AI</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron.

<p>Introduction: Rajat Raina  presented a paper on the technique they used for the  PASCAL   Recognizing Textual Entailment  challenge.  
 
“Text entailment” is the problem of deciding if one sentence implies another.  For example the previous sentence entails: 
  
 Text entailment is a decision problem. 
 One sentence can imply another. 
  
The challenge was of the form: given an original sentence and another sentence predict whether there was an entailment.  All current techniques for predicting correctness of an entailment are at the “flail” stage—accuracies of around 58% where humans could achieve near 100% accuracy, so there is much room to improve.   Apparently, there may be another PASCAL challenge on this problem in the near future.</p><p>2 0.86080718 <a title="380-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-24-Patterns_for_research_in_machine_learning.html">471 hunch net-2012-08-24-Patterns for research in machine learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are  a handful of basic code patterns  that I wish I was more aware of when I started research in machine learning. Each on its own may seem pointless, but collectively they go a long way towards making the typical research workflow more efficient. Here they are:
  
 Separate code from data. 
 Separate input data, working data and output data. 
 Save everything to disk frequently. 
 Separate options from parameters. 
 Do not use global variables. 
 Record the options used to generate each run of the algorithm. 
 Make it easy to sweep options. 
 Make it easy to execute only portions of the code. 
 Use checkpointing. 
 Write demos and tests. 
  
Click  here  for discussion and examples for each item. Also see  Charles Sutton’s  and  HackerNews’  thoughts on the same topic. 
 
My guess is that these patterns will not only be useful for machine learning, but also any other computational work that involves either a) processing large amounts of data, or b) algorithms that take a signif</p><p>same-blog 3 0.84663838 <a title="380-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-29-AI_Safety.html">380 hunch net-2009-11-29-AI Safety</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Reeves  introduced me to  Michael Vassar  who ran the  Singularity Summit  and educated me a bit on the subject of AI safety which the  Singularity Institute  has  small grants for .  
 
I still believe that  interstellar space travel is necessary for long term civilization survival, and the AI is necessary for interstellar space travel .  On these grounds alone, we could judge that developing AI is much more safe than not.  Nevertheless, there is a basic reasonable fear, as expressed by some commenters, that AI could go bad.
 
A basic scenario starts with someone inventing an AI and telling it to make as much money as possible.  The AI promptly starts trading in various markets to make money.  To improve, it crafts a virus that takes over most of the world’s computers using it as a surveillance network so that it can always make the right decision.  The AI also branches out into any form of distance work, taking over the entire outsourcing process for all jobs that are entirely di</p><p>4 0.78538477 <a title="380-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-23-Boosted_Decision_Trees_for_Deep_Learning.html">407 hunch net-2010-08-23-Boosted Decision Trees for Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated that  decision trees qualify as a deep learning algorithm  because they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in the input representation.   Ping Li  has  proved this correct, empirically  at  UAI  by showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions of  Mnist  which are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by deep learning algorithms.  
 
This is an important point, because the ability to solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a deep learning algorithm we have.   Iâ&euro;&trade;m not that surprised.  In my experience, if you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they can achieve pretty good performance.
 
 Geoff Hinton  once told me that the great thing about deep belief networks is that they work.  I understand that Ping had very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some reviewers step up to the standard of valuing wha</p><p>5 0.764754 <a title="380-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-11-The_Heritage_Health_Prize.html">430 hunch net-2011-04-11-The Heritage Health Prize</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  Heritage Health Prize  is potentially the largest prediction prize yet at $3M, which is sure to get many people interested.  Several elements of the competition may be worth discussing.
  
 The most straightforward way for HPN to deploy this predictor is in determining who to cover with insurance.  This might easily cover the costs of running the contest itself, but the value to the health system of a whole is minimal, as people not covered still exist.  While HPN itself is a provider network, they have active relationships with a number of insurance companies, and the right to resell any entrant.  It’s worth keeping in mind that the research and development may nevertheless end up being useful in the longer term, especially as entrants also keep the right to their code. 
 The  judging metric  is something I haven’t seen previously.  If a patient has probability 0.5 of being in the hospital 0 days and probability 0.5 of being in the hospital ~53.6 days, the optimal prediction in e</p><p>6 0.59046054 <a title="380-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>

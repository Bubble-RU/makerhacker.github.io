believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The

<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane

<p>Introduction: At thelast ICML,Tom Dietterichasked me to look into systems for commenting on
papers. I've been slow getting to this, but it's relevant now.The essential
observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they
are not yet much used in academic research. If we can find the right way to
use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the
first conference that manages to really create an online community. Various
conferences have been poking at this. For example,UAI has setup a wiki, COLT
hasstarted usingJoomla, with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting
up a "student blog". Similarly,Dinoj Surendransetup a twiki for theChicago
Machine Learning Summer School, which was quite useful for coordinating events
and other things.I believe the most important thing is a willingness to
experiment. A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference
websites. For example, theICML 2007 papers pageis basically only useful via
grep. A mu</p><p>6 0.11423272 <a title="364-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple security researchersclaim to have cracked the netflix dataset. The
claims of success appear somewhat overstated to me, but the method of attack
is valid and could plausibly be substantially improved so as to reveal the
movie preferences of a small fraction of Netflix users.The basic idea is to
use a heuristic similarity function between ratings in a public database (from
IMDB) and an anonymized database (Netflix) to link ratings in the private
database to public identities (in IMDB). They claim to have linked two of a
few dozen IMDB users to anonymized netflix users.The claims seem a bit
inflated to me, because (a) knowing the IMDB identity isn't equivalent to
knowing the person and (b) the claims of statistical significance are with
respect to a model of the world they created (rather than one they
created).Overall, this is another example showing that completeprivacy is
hard. It may be worth remembering that there are some substantial benefits
from the Netflix challenge as w</p><p>5 0.52906036 <a title="364-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-02-User_preferences_for_search_engines.html">423 hunch net-2011-02-02-User preferences for search engines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic
queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com
using Internet Explorer with the Bing toolbar and later noticed some synthetic
responses from B</p><p>6 0.46563482 <a title="364-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition is about to get started.
The aim of the competition is to facilitate direct comparisons between various
learning methods on important and realistic domains. This year's event will
feature well-known benchmark domains as well as more challenging problems of
real-world complexity, such as helicopter control and robot soccer
keepaway.The competition begins on November 1st, 2007 when training software
is released. Results must be submitted by July 1st, 2008. The competition will
culminate in an event at ICML-08 in Helsinki, Finland, at which the winners
will be announced.For more information, visitthe competition website.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88146508 <a title="364-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-11-Interesting_papers_at_KDD.html">364 hunch net-2009-07-11-Interesting papers at KDD</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for
all sorts of tasks where it either wasn't previously collected, or for tasks
that did not previously exist. While this is great for Machine Learning, it
has a downside--the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead
to substantial privacy problems.It's important to understand that this is a
much harder problem than many people appreciate. TheAOLdatareleaseis a good
example. To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be
obvious:Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable
information. The logic here seems to be "if I can't easily find the person
then no one can". That doesn't work as demonstrated by the people who were
found circumstantially from the AOL data.… then just hash all the search
terms! The logic here is "if I can't read it, then no one can". It's also
trivially broken by a dictionary attack--just hash all the strings that might
be in the data an</p><p>4 0.70012212 <a title="364-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-27-Gradients_everywhere.html">167 hunch net-2006-03-27-Gradients everywhere</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from theatomic learning workshopis that
gradient-based optimization is pervasive. For example, at least 7 (of 12)
speakers used the word 'gradient' in their talk and several others may be
approximating a gradient. The essential useful quality of a gradient is that
it decouples local updates from global optimization. Restated: Given a
gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system
so as to improve overall performance.It's easy to feel depressed about this
and think "nothing has happened", but that appears untrue. Many of the talks
were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus
textbook breaks down.Sometimes there are clever approximations of the
gradient. (Simon Osindero)Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via
iterated gradient/project steps. (Ben Taskar)Sometimes we can compute
gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. (Drew Bagnell)Even
given a gradient, the choice of upda</p><p>5 0.53229582 <a title="364-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>6 0.5310986 <a title="364-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>

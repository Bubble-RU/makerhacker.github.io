</p><p>9 In general, costs vary wildly, but for a typical academic international conference, airfare, hotel, and registration are commonly at least $1000 even after scrimping. [sent-15, score-0.365]
</p><p>10 The sizes of audiences also varies substantially, but something in the 30-100 range is a typical average. [sent-16, score-0.275]

</p><p>16 Valuing these equally, we see that videolectures increases the size of the audience, and (hence) the value to authors by perhaps a factor of 2 for a cost around 1/3 of current presentation costs. [sent-25, score-0.926]
</p><p>17 This conclusion is conservative, because a videolecture is almost surely viewed over more than a year, cost of conference attendance are often higher, and the cost in terms of a presenter's time is not accounted for. [sent-26, score-1.28]

<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical
conference: COLT.Bayesian LearningBayes law is always used. Focus on methods
of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and
practical applications. Typical conferences: NIPS,UAIStructured
learningPredicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical
conferences: NIPS, UAI, othersReinforcement LearningFocused on 'agent-in-the-
world' learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward. Typical

case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April

few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago, we discussed the health ofCOLT.COLT 2008substantially addressed my
concerns. The papers were diverse and several were interesting. Attendance was
up, which is particularly notable in Europe. In my opinion, the colocation
with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.And, perhaps best of all,
registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from
theAcademy of Finland,Google,IBM, andYahoo.A basic question is: what went
right? There seem to be several answers.Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants
to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university
substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel.Organization-wise, the
Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up. Having
too many volunteers is a good failure mode.Organization-wise, it was clear
that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program
.Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made the colocation much more
real than many others</p><p>5 0.10757435 <a title="416-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-03-Conference_attendance_is_mandatory.html">66 hunch net-2005-05-03-Conference attendance is mandatory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually
mandatory for success. Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of
different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen
at conferences. If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one
summer conference. Your advisor should cover the costs.ConferenceLocationEarly

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>4 0.59086281 <a title="416-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>5 0.57906413 <a title="416-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-06-MLTV.html">146 hunch net-2006-01-06-MLTV</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good

pdf, if interested, and note that we:widened submissions to be from anybody
rather than students.set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed
submissions.September 15, there is amachine learning meetup, where I'll be
discussing terascale learning at AOL.September 16, there is aCS&Econ; dayat New
York Academy of Sciences. This is not ML focused, but it's easy to imagine
interest.September 23 and laterNIPS workshopsubmissions start coming due. As
usual, there are too many good ones, so I won't be able to attend all those
that interest me. I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming
summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you. Here are a few that
interest me:Big Learningis about dealing with lots of data. Abstracts are

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>same-blog 4 0.84332579 <a title="416-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side
synchronized slides &</p><p>5 0.7916432 <a title="416-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-17-Partha_Niyogi_has_died.html">414 hunch net-2010-10-17-Partha Niyogi has died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: from brain cancer. I askedMishawho worked with him to write about it.Partha
Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43.I first met
Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in
math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics
at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a
somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I
asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new
to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We
made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially
just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation.
I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity
and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus for
inquiries wo</p><p>6 0.73097932 <a title="416-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-21-Regretting_the_dead.html">411 hunch net-2010-09-21-Regretting the dead</a></p>

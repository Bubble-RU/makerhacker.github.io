Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>3 0.13671103 <a title="416-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine learning currently underway.  This isn’t easy—this map is partial, the categories often overlap, and there are many details left out.  Nevertheless, it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where.  The word ‘typical’ should not be construed narrowly here.
  
  Learning Theory  Focuses on analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments.  Typical conference: COLT. 
  Bayesian Learning  Bayes law is always used. Focus on methods of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and practical applications.  Typical conferences: NIPS,UAI 
  Structured learning  Predicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical conferences: NIPS, UAI, others 
  Reinforcement Learning  Focused on ‘agent-in-the-world’ learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward.  Typical conferences: ICML

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeck  points out  COLT   registration  with a May 13 early registration deadline.   The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs with a $300 registration fee.
 
 ICML   registration  is also available, at about an x3 higher cost.  My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>5 0.11454078 <a title="416-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

For the first time in several years,  ICML 2010  did not have  videolectures  attending.  Luckily, the  tutorial on exploration and learning  which  Alina  and I put together can  be viewed , since we also presented at  KDD 2010 , which included videolecture support.

<p>Introduction: Some of the “sister conference” presentations at  AAAI  have been great.  Roughly speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come give a summary of their conference.  Many different AI-related conferences accepted.  The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked.  This is great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work of several thousand researchers—something which is simply available nowhere else.
 
Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning in  AIIDE ,  IUI , and  ACL .
 
There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event similar to  FCRC , but centered on AI & Learning.  This seems like a fine idea.  The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>3 0.62461644 <a title="416-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.
 
The conference will take place on 13-15 June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.
 
The website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.html
 
The early registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel rates is May 9.
 
Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM, $18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>4 0.61594963 <a title="416-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-24-COLT_Treasurer_is_now_Phil_Long.html">394 hunch net-2010-04-24-COLT Treasurer is now Phil Long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I’ve been the treasurer of the Association for Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over from  John Case  before me.  A transfer of duties to  Phil Long  is now about complete.  This probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for those interested.
 
The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over reviewing decisions at  COLT 2009 , one as an author and several as a member of the program committee.  I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is important work, partly because I’m focused on learning theory with practical implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from insider-clique issues.  The degree to which these issues come up varies substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one.  And, it’s important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly so bad</p><p>5 0.59583634 <a title="416-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive. 
 Tutorials are a good way to gain some understanding of a long-standing direction of research.  They are generally more coherent than workshops.   ICML has 7  and  AAAI has 15 .</p><p>6 0.5922659 <a title="416-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-05-04-COLT_and_ICML_registration.html">482 hunch net-2013-05-04-COLT and ICML registration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (update:  cross-posted  on  CACM )
 
For the first time in several years,  ICML 2010  did not have  videolectures  attending.  Luckily, the  tutorial on exploration and learning  which  Alina  and I put together can  be viewed , since we also presented at  KDD 2010 , which included videolecture support. 
 
ICML didn’t cover the cost of a videolecture, because  PASCAL  didn’t provide a grant for it this year.  On the other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs.  The cost of videolectures isn’t cheap.  For  a workshop  the baseline quote we have is 270 euro per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman’s travel and accomodation.  This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a quoted 216 euro per hour.
 
 Youtube  is the most predominant free video site with a cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.   15 minute upload limits  do not match typical talk lengths.</p><p>2 0.83689123 <a title="416-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.  This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mec</p><p>3 0.83348322 <a title="416-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-28-Machined_Learnings.html">412 hunch net-2010-09-28-Machined Learnings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Mineiro  has started  Machined Learnings  where heâ&euro;&trade;s seriously attempting to do ML research in public.

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple.  Viewed representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural networks or kernelized SVMs).  Should we go beyond this, and start using “deep” representations?
 
 What is deep learning?  
Intuitively, deep learning is about learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the input (observed) features.
 
Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be rather difficult.  Consider the following cases:
  
 SVM with Gaussian Kernel.  This is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can’t succinctly represent certain decision surfaces.  One of  Yann LeCun ‘s examples is recognizing objects based on pixel values.  An SVM will need a new support vector for each significantly different background.  Since the number</p><p>5 0.60600656 <a title="416-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>6 0.59769309 <a title="416-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>

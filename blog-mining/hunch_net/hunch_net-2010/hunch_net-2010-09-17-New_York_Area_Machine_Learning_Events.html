<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>3 0.19418615 <a title="410-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-09-20-No_NY_ML_Symposium_in_2013%2C_and_some_good_news.html">489 hunch net-2013-09-20-No NY ML Symposium in 2013, and some good news</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There will be no New York ML Symposium this year.  The core issue is that  NYAS  is disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current candidate a spring symposium on March 28.   Gunnar  and I were outvoted hereâ&euro;&rdquo;we were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee wants to wait.
 
In some good news, most of the  ICML 2012 videos  have been restored from a deep backup.</p><p>4 0.1877033 <a title="410-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-04-Fall_ML_Conferences.html">316 hunch net-2008-09-04-Fall ML Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are in the New York area and interested in machine learning, consider submitting a 2 page abstract to the  ML symposium  by tomorrow (Sept 5th) midnight.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s a fun one day affair on October 10 in an awesome location overlooking the world trade center site.

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:
 
  Big Learning  is about dealing with lots of data.  Abstracts are due  September 30 .

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>2 0.74873924 <a title="410-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-19-NIPS_Workshops.html">113 hunch net-2005-09-19-NIPS Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attendance at the  NIPS workshops  is highly recommended for both research and learning.   Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of interest:
  
  Machine Learning in Finance  
  Learning to Rank  
  Foundations of Active Learning  
  Machine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured Environments  
  
There are  many  more workshops.  In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in.  Maybe in future years the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap. 
 
Many of these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>3 0.73728466 <a title="410-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-20-Workshop_Proposal%3A_Atomic_Learning.html">114 hunch net-2005-09-20-Workshop Proposal: Atomic Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a proposal for a workshop.  It may or may not happen depending on the level of interest.  If you are interested, feel free to indicate so (by email or comments).
 
Description: 
Assume(*) that any system for solving large difficult learning problems must decompose into repeated use of basic elements (i.e. atoms).  There are many basic questions which remain:
  
  What are the viable basic elements? 
  What makes a basic element viable? 
  What are the viable principles for the composition of these basic elements? 
  What are the viable principles for learning in such systems? 
  What problems can this approach handle? 
  
Hal Daume adds:
  
 Can composition of atoms be (semi-) automatically constructed[?] 
 When atoms are constructed through reductions, is there some notion of the “naturalness” of the created leaning problems? 
 Other than Markov fields/graphical models/Bayes nets, is there a good language for representing atoms and their compositions? 
  
The answer to these a</p><p>4 0.61408681 <a title="410-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-01-Multitask_Poisoning.html">358 hunch net-2009-06-01-Multitask Poisoning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done.  For example it’s common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting in a paper.  In some sense,  these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we should ask: Can all research be this easy?  
 
The answer is certainly no for fields where research inherently requires  experimentation to discover how the real world works.  However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer science, statistics, etc… which are effectively mathematics don’t require experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of thinking.  Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?
 
What’s going on here is research-by-communication.  Someone knows something, someone knows something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.  The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming radic</p><p>5 0.57887781 <a title="410-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-12-Summer_Conferences.html">331 hunch net-2008-12-12-Summer Conferences</a></p>

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>6 0.56372792 <a title="410-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-26-Compassionate_Reviewing.html">395 hunch net-2010-04-26-Compassionate Reviewing</a></p>

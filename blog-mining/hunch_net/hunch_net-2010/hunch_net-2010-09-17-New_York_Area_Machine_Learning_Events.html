submitting a 2 page abstract to theML symposiumby tomorrow (Sept 5th)

overlooking the world trade center site.A bit further off (but a real

<p>Introduction: A new direction of research seems to be arising in machine learning:
Interactive Machine Learning. This isn't a familiar term, although it does
include some familiar subjects.What is Interactive Machine Learning?The
fundamental requirement is (a) learning algorithms which interact with the
world and (b) learn.For our purposes, let's define learning as efficiently
competing with a large set of possible predictors. Examples include:Online
learning against an adversary (Avrim's Notes). The interaction is almost
trivial: the learning algorithm makes a prediction and then receives feedback.
The learning is choosing based upon the advice of many experts.Active
Learning. In active learning, the interaction is choosing which examples to
label, and the learning is choosing from amongst a large set of
hypotheses.Contextual Bandits. The interaction is choosing one of several
actions and learning only the value of the chosen action (weaker than active
learning feedback).More forms of interaction w</p><p>5 0.14934608 <a title="410-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-18-Datasets.html">284 hunch net-2008-01-18-Datasets</a></p>

Machine Learning Symposiumtomorrow from 9:30am.The main program will feature
invited talks fromPeter Bartlett,William Freeman, andVladimir Vapnik, along
with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main
program,hackNYandMicrosoft Researchare sponsoring a networking hour with talks
from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups
(specificallybit.ly,Buzzfeed,Chartbeat, andSense Networks,Visual Revenue).

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>6 0.53970677 <a title="410-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-04-Fall_ML_Conferences.html">316 hunch net-2008-09-04-Fall ML Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.66402406 <a title="410-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson's paper, there were (at least) two other papers that
caught my eye at UAI.One wasthis paperby Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul
Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost
all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with
finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look
like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you'd expect from
Sanjoy.The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven't
groked yet isthis beastby Manfred and Dima Kuzmin.You can check out the
(beautiful)slidesif that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but
my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides
are also on Manfred's page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>6 0.57055008 <a title="410-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-Basic_computer_science_research_takes_a_hit.html">50 hunch net-2005-04-01-Basic computer science research takes a hit</a></p>

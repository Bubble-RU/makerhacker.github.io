</p><p>5 Nevertheless, I would like to see them taken more actively into account than I’ve been able to persuade people so far. [sent-8, score-0.154]
</p><p>6 After thinking about it for a few days before acting, I decided to go ahead with the transfer for another reason: I’ve been suffering from multitask poisoning. [sent-9, score-0.247]
</p><p>7 Partly this is  Ada , but partly it’s many other things, each of which takes a small bit of my time, in aggregate leaving me disappointing people, myself in particular. [sent-10, score-0.613]
</p><p>8 Despite the above, I found being treasurer not particularly difficult. [sent-14, score-0.324]
</p><p>9 The functions of the treasury part of ACL have been      Self-insurance for the conference each year. [sent-15, score-0.216]
</p><p>10 Prior to the formation of ACL-the-nonprofit (which  Bob  was instrumental in), COLT used to buy insurance against the possibility that some disaster would strike canceling the conference while leaving the local organizer on the hook for substantial expenses. [sent-16, score-0.838]
</p><p>11 When I came in, the treasury was a little bit low for this function, and when I left, somewhat too high. [sent-17, score-0.323]

</p><p>13 Without the ACL, dealing with net positive or negative local accounts from year to year was awkward. [sent-20, score-0.504]
</p><p>14 A stable point of contact for funding related things. [sent-22, score-0.237]
</p><p>15 COLT is partly sponsored by several big CS-related companies including IBM, Microsoft, and Google. [sent-23, score-0.318]
</p><p>16 Providing a stable point of contact definitely helps ease this process. [sent-24, score-0.315]
</p><p>17 Somewhat to my surprise, the proper role of the treasurer was typically asking the local organizer to reduce registration fees rather than increase. [sent-27, score-0.87]
</p><p>18 The essential observation is that local organizers, because they operate out of a local account, tend to be a bit conservative in budget estimates. [sent-28, score-0.917]
</p><p>19 On the other hand, because ACL has an adequate interest bearing account, we should expect and desire to spend the interest in each typical year. [sent-29, score-0.302]
</p><p>20 After having been treasurer for a little while, I’m convinced that having a nonprofit to back a conference is a good idea easing many difficulties with relatively small effort. [sent-31, score-0.614]

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeck  points out  COLT   registration  with a May 13 early registration deadline.   The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs with a $300 registration fee.
 
 ICML   registration  is also available, at about an x3 higher cost.  My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>3 0.16345391 <a title="394-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By  Shie  and  Nati 
 
Following John’s advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is often the best place for theory papers.  We would like to emphasize that we both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs, and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers.  For many papers, ICML is the best venue.  But for many theory papers, COLT is a better and more appropriate place.
 
Why should you submit to COLT?
 
By-and-large, theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT is more focused then ICML with a single track session.  Unlike ICML, the norm in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks presented.  There is also often a lively discussion followi</p><p>4 0.16000263 <a title="394-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The health of  COLT  (Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.  Low points for the conference occurred when  EuroCOLT  merged with COLT in 2001, and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low.  This occurred in the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and size over the last decade.
 
Any discussion of  why  COLT has had difficulties is inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making the wrong decisions.   Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of avoiding problems in the future and general understanding.  In any such discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking.  Keep in mind that conferences exist to further research.
 
My understanding (I wasn’t around) is that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science</p><p>5 0.14875984 <a title="394-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.
 
The conference will take place on 13-15 June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.
 
The website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.html
 
The early registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel rates is May 9.
 
Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM, $18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>4 0.70060092 <a title="394-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-09-A_Healthy__COLT.html">324 hunch net-2008-11-09-A Healthy  COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  while ago , we discussed the health of  COLT .   COLT 2008  substantially addressed my concerns.  The papers were diverse and several were interesting.  Attendance was up, which is particularly notable in Europe.  In my opinion, the colocation with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.
 
And, perhaps best of all, registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from the  Academy of Finland ,  Google ,  IBM , and  Yahoo .
 
A basic question is: what went right?  There seem to be several answers.
  
 Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel. 
 Organization-wise, the Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up.  Having too many volunteers is a good failure mode. 
 Organization-wise, it was clear that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program. 
 Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made</p><p>5 0.69572425 <a title="394-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-05-04-COLT_and_ICML_registration.html">482 hunch net-2013-05-04-COLT and ICML registration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rexa  is now publicly available.  Anyone can create an account and login.  
 
Rexa is similar to  Citeseer  and  Google Scholar  in functionality with more emphasis on the use of machine learning for intelligent information extraction.   For example, Rexa can automatically display a picture on an authorâ&euro;&trade;s homepage when the author is searched for.</p><p>2 0.90830451 <a title="394-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-12-Who_is_having_visa_problems_reaching_US_conferences%3F.html">195 hunch net-2006-07-12-Who is having visa problems reaching US conferences?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many of the large machine learning conferences were in the US this summer.  A common problem which students from abroad encounter is visa issues. 
Just getting a visa to visit can be pretty rough: you stand around in lines, sometimes for days.  Even worse is the timing with respect to ticket buying.  Airplane tickets typically need to be bought well in advance on nonrefundable terms to secure a reasonable rate for air travel.  When a visa is denied, as happens reasonably often, a very expensive ticket is burnt.
 
A serious effort is under way to raise this as in issue in need of fixing.  Over the long term, effectively driving research conferences to locate outside of the US seems an unwise policy.   Robert Schapire  is planning to talk to a congressman.   Sally Goldman  suggested putting together a list of problem cases, and  Phil Long  setup an email address  immigration.and.confs@gmail.com  to collect them.

<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I’ve been the treasurer of the Association for Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over from  John Case  before me.  A transfer of duties to  Phil Long  is now about complete.  This probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for those interested.
 
The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over reviewing decisions at  COLT 2009 , one as an author and several as a member of the program committee.  I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is important work, partly because I’m focused on learning theory with practical implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from insider-clique issues.  The degree to which these issues come up varies substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one.  And, it’s important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly so bad</p><p>4 0.81219184 <a title="394-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-05-The_design_of_a_computing_cluster.html">128 hunch net-2005-11-05-The design of a computing cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied machine learning using current technology.  We just built a small one at TTI so this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design choices.
  
  Architecture   There are several architectural choices.
 
 AMD Athlon64 based system.  This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck.  Maximum RAM is typically 2-3GB. 
 AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB of RAM.  The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type. 
 Intel PIV or Xeon based system.  The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the above 2.  Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit hotter and be a bit more expensive. 
 Dual core chips.  Both Intel and AMD have chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them. 

In the end, we decided to go with option (2).

<p>Introduction: I have recently completed  a 500+ page-book on MDL , the first comprehensive overview of the field (yes, this is a sneak advertisement    ). 
 Chapter 17  compares MDL to a menagerie of other methods and paradigms for learning and statistics. By far the most time (20 pages) is spent on the relation between MDL and Bayes. My two main points here are:
  
  In sharp contrast to Bayes, MDL is by definition based on designing universal codes for the data relative to some given (parametric or nonparametric) probabilistic model M. By some theorems due to  Andrew Barron , MDL inference  must  therefore be statistically consistent, and it is immune to Bayesian inconsistency results such as those by Diaconis, Freedman and Barron (I explain what I mean by “inconsistency” further below).  Hence, MDL must be different from Bayes! 
 In contrast to what has sometimes been claimed, practical MDL algorithms do have a subjective component (which in many, but not all cases, may be implemented by somethin</p><p>6 0.50598216 <a title="394-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

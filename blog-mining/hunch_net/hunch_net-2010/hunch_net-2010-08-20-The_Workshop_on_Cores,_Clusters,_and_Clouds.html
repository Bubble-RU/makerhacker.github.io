<p>Introduction: Manik  and I are organizing the  extreme classification  workshop at NIPS this year.  We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9.  I believe this is an idea whose time has now come.

<p>Introduction: I just made  version 6.1  of  Vowpal Wabbit .  Relative to  6.0 , there are few new features, but many refinements. 
  
 The cluster parallel learning code better supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been mostly removed.  This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning core. 
 The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l 1  (via a truncated gradient variant) and l 2  regularization, and a generalized form of variable metric learning. 
 There is a solid persistent server mode which can train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in text or binary. 
  
This should be a very good release if you are just getting started, as we’ve made it compile more automatically out of the box, have several new  examples  and updated documentation.

<p>Introduction: Previously, we discussed  parallel machine learning  a bit.  As parallel ML is rather difficult, I’d like to describe my thinking at the moment, and ask for advice from the rest of the world.  This is particularly relevant right now, as I’m attending a workshop tomorrow on parallel ML.
 
Parallelizing slow algorithms seems uncompelling.  Parallelizing many algorithms also seems uncompelling, because the effort required to parallelize is substantial.  This leaves the question: Which one fast algorithm is the best to parallelize?  What is a substantially different second?
 
One compellingly fast simple algorithm is online gradient descent on a linear representation.  This is the core of Leon’s  sgd  code and  Vowpal Wabbit .   Antoine Bordes  showed a variant was competitive in the  large scale learning challenge .  It’s also a decades old primitive which has been reused in many algorithms, and continues to be reused.  It also applies to online  learning  rather than just online  optimiz</p><p>5 0.16862887 <a title="404-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-22-Create_Your_Own_ICML_Workshop.html">234 hunch net-2007-02-22-Create Your Own ICML Workshop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>6 0.14485142 <a title="404-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-26-Parallel_Machine_Learning_Problems.html">229 hunch net-2007-01-26-Parallel Machine Learning Problems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m releasing  version 4.0 ( tarball ) of  Vowpal Wabbit .  The biggest change (by far) in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable help from  Daniel Hsu .  
 
I also took advantage of the major version number to introduce some incompatible changes, including switching to  murmurhash 2 , and other alterations to cachefiles.  You’ll need to delete and regenerate them.  In addition, the precise specification for a “tag” (i.e. string that can be used to identify an example) changed—you can’t have a space between the tag and the ‘|’ at the beginning of the feature namespace.  
 
And, of course, we made it faster.
 
For the future, I put up my  todo list  outlining the major future improvements I want to see in the code.  I’m planning to discuss the current mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at the  large scale machine learning workshop  at  NIPS  later this week.

<p>Introduction: The  From Data to Knowledge  workshop May 7-11 at  Berkeley  should be of interest to the many people encountering streaming data in different disciplines.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s run by a group of astronomers who encounter streaming data all the time.  I met  Josh Bloom  recently and he is broadly interested in a workshop covering all aspects of Machine Learning on streaming data.  The hope here is that techniques developed in one area turn out useful in another which seems quite plausible.  Particularly if you are in the bay area, consider checking it out.</p><p>5 0.55477834 <a title="404-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">488 hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alekh ,  John ,  Ofer , and I are organizing a  workshop  at  NIPS  this year on learning in parallel and distributed environments.  The general interest level in parallel learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.  Please join us if you are parallel-interested.
 
And, if you are working in the area of parallel learning, please consider  submitting an abstract  due Oct. 17 for presentation at the workshop.</p><p>3 0.75165272 <a title="404-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-01-16-2011_Summer_Conference_Deadline_Season.html">422 hunch net-2011-01-16-2011 Summer Conference Deadline Season</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Data linkage is a problem which seems to come up in various applied machine learning problems.  I have heard it mentioned in various data mining contexts, but it seems relatively less studied for systemic reasons.
 
A very simple version of the data linkage problem is a cross hospital patient record merge.  Suppose a patient (John Doe) is admitted to a hospital (General Health), treated, and released.  Later, John Doe is admitted to a second hospital (Health General), treated, and released.  Given a large number of records of this sort, it becomes very tempting to try and predict the outcomes of treatments.  This is reasonably straightforward as a machine learning problem if there is a shared unique identifier for John Doe used by General Health and Health General along with time stamps.  We can merge the records and create examples of the form “Given symptoms and treatment, did the patient come back to a hospital within the next year?”  These examples could be fed into a learning algo</p><p>5 0.53880131 <a title="404-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea how to solve.  In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a solution to the larger problem.  This approach can go wrong in several ways. 
  
  Decomposition failure .  The solution to the decomposition does not in fact yield a solution to the overall problem. 
  Artificial hardness .  The subproblems created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are harder than necessary. 
  
As you can see, computational complexity forms a relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach sufficient but not necessary.
 
In my experience, the artificial hardness problem is very common.  Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a problem to work on to other people.  This process starts very naturally as a graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively l</p><p>6 0.51873446 <a title="404-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-06-Don%26%238217%3Bt_mix_the_solution_into_the_problem.html">67 hunch net-2005-05-06-Don&#8217;t mix the solution into the problem</a></p>

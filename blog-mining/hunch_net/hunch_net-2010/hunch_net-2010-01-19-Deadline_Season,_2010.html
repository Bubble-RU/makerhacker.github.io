<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>6 0.3096334 <a title="387-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-12-Summer_Conferences.html">331 hunch net-2008-12-12-Summer Conferences</a></p>

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>6 0.75857216 <a title="387-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-29-Deadline_Season.html">145 hunch net-2005-12-29-Deadline Season</a></p>

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.
  
  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .  This is stretching the definition of “New York Area” a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable.</p><p>3 0.72004592 <a title="387-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Mcallester  gave a talk about this  paper  (with  Pedro Felzenszwalb ).  I’ll try to give a high level summary of why it’s interesting.
 
Dynamic programming is most familiar as instantiated by Viterbi decoding in a hidden markov model.  It is a general paradigm for problem solving where subproblems are solved and used to solve larger problems.  In the Viterbi decoding example, the subproblem is “What is the most probable path ending at each state at timestep  t ?”, and the larger problem is the same except at timestep  t+1 .  There are a few optimizations you can do here:
  
  Dynamic Programming -> queued Dynamic Programming . Keep track of the “cost so far” (or “most probable path”) and (carefully) only look at extensions to paths likely to yield the shortest path.  “Carefully” here is defined by  Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm . 
  queued Dynamic programming -> A *  Add a lower bound on the cost to complete a path (or an upper bound on the probability of a completion) for</p><p>4 0.67716652 <a title="387-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-12-Summer_Conferences.html">331 hunch net-2008-12-12-Summer Conferences</a></p>

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>5 0.66298091 <a title="387-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-15-ESPgame_and_image_labeling.html">20 hunch net-2005-02-15-ESPgame and image labeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn  has been running the  espgame  for awhile now.  The espgame provides a picture to two randomly paired people across the web, and asks them to agree on a label.  It hasn’t managed to label the web yet, but it has produced a  large dataset  of (image, label) pairs.  I organized the dataset so you could  explore the implied bipartite graph  (requires much bandwidth).
 
Relative to other image datasets, this one is quite large—67000 images, 358,000 labels (average of 5/image with variation from 1 to 19), and 22,000 unique labels (one every 3 images).  The dataset is also very ‘natural’, consisting of images spidered from the internet.  The multiple label characteristic is intriguing because ‘learning to learn’ and metalearning techniques may be applicable.  The ‘natural’ quality means that this dataset varies greatly in difficulty from easy (predicting “red”) to hard (predicting “funny”) and potentially more rewarding to tackle.

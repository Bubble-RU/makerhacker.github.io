<p>Introduction: I just released  Vowpal Wabbit 6.0 .  Since the last version:
  
 VW is now 2-3 orders of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks to  Alekh .  Given the baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects.  The core improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters (either  Hadoop  or not).   This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with clusters of size 2 (and doesn’t hurt for clusters of size 1).  The core allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused—we’ve already used it to parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.  We’ll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now “README_cluster” and associated scripts should provide a good starting point.
 
 The new  LBFGS  code from  Miro  seems to commonly dominate the existing conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.

<p>Introduction: At NIPS,  Andrew Ng  asked me what should be in a large scale learning class.  After some discussion with him and  Nando  and mulling it over a bit, these are the topics that I think should be covered.
 
There are many different kinds of scaling.
  
  Scaling in examples   This is the most basic kind of scaling.
 
  Online Gradient Descent  This is an old algorithm—I’m not sure if anyone can be credited with it in particular.  Perhaps the  Perceptron  is a good precursor, but substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of which  squared loss ,  logistic loss , Hinge Loss, and  Quantile Loss  are all worth covering.  It’s important to cover the  semantics  of these loss functions as well.   Vowpal Wabbit  is a reasonably fast codebase implementing these. 
  Second Order Gradient Descent methods  For some problems, methods taking into account second derivative information can be more effective.  I’ve seen preconditioned conjugate gradient work well, for which  Jonath</p><p>4 0.15692109 <a title="419-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-21-Vowpal_Wabbit_Code_Release.html">281 hunch net-2007-12-21-Vowpal Wabbit Code Release</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are releasing the  Vowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) code  as open source under a BSD (revised) license.  This is a  project at Yahoo! Research  to build a useful large scale learning algorithm which  Lihong Li ,  Alex Strehl , and I have been working on.
 
To appreciate the meaning of “large”, it’s useful to define “small” and “medium”.  A “small” supervised learning problem is one where a human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor.  A “medium” supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern desktop computer.  A “large” supervised learning problem is one which does not fit into the RAM of a normal machine.  VW tackles large scale learning problems by this definition of large.  I’m not aware of any other open source Machine Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist).  A few close ones are:

<p>Introduction: I’m releasing  version 4.0 ( tarball ) of  Vowpal Wabbit .  The biggest change (by far) in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable help from  Daniel Hsu .  
 
I also took advantage of the major version number to introduce some incompatible changes, including switching to  murmurhash 2 , and other alterations to cachefiles.  You’ll need to delete and regenerate them.  In addition, the precise specification for a “tag” (i.e. string that can be used to identify an example) changed—you can’t have a space between the tag and the ‘|’ at the beginning of the feature namespace.  
 
And, of course, we made it faster.
 
For the future, I put up my  todo list  outlining the major future improvements I want to see in the code.  I’m planning to discuss the current mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at the  large scale machine learning workshop  at  NIPS  later this week.

<p>Introduction: I just made  version 6.1  of  Vowpal Wabbit .  Relative to  6.0 , there are few new features, but many refinements. 
  
 The cluster parallel learning code better supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been mostly removed.  This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning core. 
 The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l 1  (via a truncated gradient variant) and l 2  regularization, and a generalized form of variable metric learning. 
 There is a solid persistent server mode which can train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in text or binary. 
  
This should be a very good release if you are just getting started, as we’ve made it compile more automatically out of the box, have several new  examples  and updated documentation.
 
As  per   tradition , we’re planning to do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at the  parallel learning workshop  at 2pm Spanish time Friday.

<p>Introduction: Today brings a new release of the  Vowpal Wabbit  fast online learning software.  This time, unlike the previous release, the project itself is going open source, developing via  github .  For example, the lastest and greatest can be downloaded via:
  
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
  
If you aren’t familiar with  git , it’s a distributed version control system which supports quick and easy branching, as well as reconciliation.
 
This version of the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of OSX as well as Linux boxes.
 
As much of the point of this project is pushing the limits of fast and effective machine learning, let me mention a few datapoints from my experience.
  
 The program can effectively scale up to batch-style training on sparse terafeature (i.e. 10 12  sparse feature) size datasets.  The limiting factor is typically i/o.

<p>Introduction: I was not as personally close to  Ben  as  Sam , but the level of tragedy is similar and I canâ&euro;&trade;t help but be greatly saddened by the loss.
 
Various  news   stories  have coverage, but the synopsis is that he had a heart attack on Sunday and is survived by his wife Anat and daughter Aviv.  There is discussion of creating a memorial fund for them, which I hope comes to fruition, and plan to contribute to.  
 
I will remember Ben as someone who thought carefully and comprehensively about new ways to do things, then fought hard and successfully for what he believed in.  It is an ideal we strive for, that Ben accomplished.

<p>Introduction: I’ve released  version 5.0  of the  Vowpal Wabbit  online learning software.  The major number has changed since the  last release  because I regard all earlier versions as obsolete—there are several new algorithms & features including substantial changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.  
 
The biggest changes are new algorithms:
  
  Nikos  and I improved the default algorithm.  The basic update rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully controlled so that it’s impossible to overrun the label.  In addition, the normalization has changed.  Computationally, these changes are virtually free and yield better results, sometimes much better.  Less careful updates can be reenabled with –loss_function classic, although results are still not identical to previous due to normalization changes. 
 Nikos also implemented the per-feature learning rates as per these  two   papers .  Often, this works better than the default algorithm.  It isn’t the defa</p><p>3 0.8279174 <a title="419-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-02-Proprietary_Data_in_Academic_Research%3F.html">306 hunch net-2008-07-02-Proprietary Data in Academic Research?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should results of experiments on proprietary datasets be in the academic research literature?
 
The arguments I can imagine in the “against” column are: 
  
  Experiments are not repeatable.  Repeatability in experiments is essential to science because it allows others to compare new methods with old and discover which is better. 
  It’s unfair.  Academics who don’t have insider access to proprietary data are at a substantial disadvantage when competing with others who do. 
  
I’m unsympathetic to argument (2).  To me, it looks like their are simply some resource constraints, and these should not prevent research progress.  For example, we wouldn’t prevent publishing about particle accelerator experiments by physicists at  CERN  because physicists at  CMU  couldn’t run their own experiments.  
 
Argument (1) seems like a real issue.
 
The argument for is:

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially touchy subject.  Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought about carefully.
 
There are a few things which should be understood:
  
 The system is changing and responsive.  We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC, and even we-the-NIPS-board.  NIPS has implemented ‘secondary program chairs’, ‘author response’, and ‘double blind reviewing’ in the last few years to help with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future. 
 Agreement creates a perception of correctness.  When any PC meets and makes a group decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness.  For the many people who have been on the NIPS PC it’s reasonable to entertain a healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.

<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance. 
 How does the algorithm scale with the number of</p><p>6 0.63973677 <a title="419-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-02-User_preferences_for_search_engines.html">423 hunch net-2011-02-02-User preferences for search engines</a></p>

</p><p>2 Consider: How is it even possible to choose a setting where analysis is tractable before you even try to analyze it? [sent-11, score-0.577]
</p><p>3 Online Learning   The online learning setting is perhaps the most satisfying specialization more general than standard batch learning at present, because it turns out to additionally provide tractable algorithms for many batch learning settings. [sent-13, score-0.797]
</p><p>4 Standard online learning models specialize in two ways: You assume that the choice of action in step 2 does not influence future observations and rewards, and you assume additional information is available in step 3, a retrospectively available reward for each action. [sent-14, score-0.826]
</p><p>5 The algorithm for an agent in this setting typically has a given name—gradient descent, weighted majority, Winnow, etc…   The general algorithm here is a more refined version of follow-the-leader than in batch learning, with online update rules. [sent-15, score-0.851]
</p><p>6 An awesome discovery about this setting is that it’s possible to compete with a set of predictors even when the world is totally adversarial, substantially strengthening our understanding of what learning is and where it might be useful. [sent-16, score-0.703]
</p><p>7 The standard form of argument in this setting is a potential argument, where at each step you show that if the learning algorithm performs badly, there is some finite budget from which an adversary deducts it’s ability. [sent-18, score-0.694]

</p><p>13 However, the setting is flawed, because the set of constant strategies is inevitably too weak in practice—it’s an example of optimal decision making given that you ignore almost all information. [sent-30, score-0.636]
</p><p>14 Canonical algorithms here are  EXP4  (computationally intractable, but information theoretically near-optimal),  Epoch-Greedy  (computationally tractable given an oracle optimizer), and the  Offset Tree  providing a reduction to supervised binary classification. [sent-32, score-0.536]
</p><p>15 MDP analysis   A substantial fraction of reinforcement learning has specialized on the  Markov Decision Process  setting, where the observation  x  is a state  s , which is a sufficient statistic for predicting all future observations. [sent-33, score-0.556]

<p>Introduction: This post is about contextual bandit problems where, repeatedly:
  
 The world chooses features  x  and rewards for each action  r 1 ,…,r k   then announces the features  x  (but not the rewards). 
 A policy chooses an action  a . 
 The world announces the reward  r a   
  
The goal in these situations is to learn a policy which maximizes  r a   in expectation efficiently.  I’m thinking about all situations which fit the above setting, whether they are drawn IID or adversarially from round to round and whether they involve past logged data or rapidly learning via interaction.
 
One common drawback of all algorithms for solving this setting, is that they have a poor dependence on the number of actions.  For example if  k  is the number of actions,  EXP4 (page 66)  has a dependence on  k 0.5  ,  epoch-greedy  (and the simpler epsilon greedy) have a dependence on  k 1/3  , and the  offset tree  has a dependence on  k-1 .

I believe both of these problems are hard but plausibly solvable, and plausibly with a solution of substantial practical value.  While it’s unlikely these rewards are worth your time on an hourly wage basis, the recognition for solving them definitely should be   
  The Problem  
The problem is finding a general, robust, and efficient mechanism for estimating a conditional probability  P(y|x)  where robustness and efficiency are measured using techniques from learning reductions. 
 
In particular, suppose we have access to a binary regression oracle  B  which has two interfaces—one for specifying training information and one for testing. Training information is specified as  B(x’,y’)  where  x’  is a feature vector and  y’  is a scalar in  [0,1]  with no value returned.  Testing is done according to  B(x’)  with a value in  [0,1]  returned.</p><p>4 0.24947293 <a title="388-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-24-Contextual_Bandits.html">269 hunch net-2007-10-24-Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based content.  This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where ads are specifically matched to interests.  Everyone is familiar with this, because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money this way.
 
The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on what.  A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised—in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn’t generally tell you if a different ad would have been clicked on.  This implies we have a fundamental exploration problem.
 
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “ k -Armed Bandits”, often with various relevant embellishments.  The  k -Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.  On each round:
  
 A policy chooses arm  a  from  1  of  k  arms (i.e. 1 of k ads).

<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This isn’t for lack of trying—there are many models of exploration which have been analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these many models.
  
   Reinforcement Learning  (1) . Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next state  s’    is given by a conditional distribution  P(s’|s,a)  given the current state  s  and action  a .  The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms controlling an agent can behave within  e  of optimal for horizon  T  except for  poly(1/e,T,S,A)  “wasted” experiences (with high probability).  This started with  E 3   by  Satinder Singh  and  Michael Kearns .  Sham Kakade’s thesis  has significant discussion. Extensions have typically been of the form “under extra assumptions, we can prove more”, for example  Factored-E 3   and</p><p>6 0.20627446 <a title="388-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-01-Watchword%3A_Online_Learning.html">252 hunch net-2007-07-01-Watchword: Online Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There were  two   papers  at ICML presenting learning algorithms for a  contextual bandit -style setting, where the loss for all labels is not known, but the loss for one label is known.  (The first might require a  exploration scavenging  viewpoint to understand if the experimental assignment was nonrandom.)  I strongly approve of these papers and further work in this setting and its variants, because I expect it to become more important than supervised learning.  As a quick review, we are thinking about situations where repeatedly:
  
 The world reveals feature values (aka context information). 
 A policy chooses an action. 
 The world provides a reward. 
  
Sometimes this is done in an online fashion where the policy can change based on immediate feedback and sometimes it’s done in a batch setting where many samples are collected before the policy can change.  If you haven’t spent time thinking about the setting, you might want to because there are many natural applications.

<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I’ve never seen taught (in full generality), but which I’ve found very useful.
 
Many problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult.  The best known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean ‘discretely difficult’ in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by examples.
  
  ERM  In empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate classifier from a set of classifiers.  This is NP hard for common sets, but it can be much harder, depending on the set. 
  Experts  In the online learning with experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of (adversarial) experts.  Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that grows exponentially. 
  Policy Iteration  The problem with policy iteration is that you learn a new policy with respect to an old policy, which implies that sim</p><p>6 0.75631636 <a title="388-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-06-13-The_Good_News_on_Exploration_and_Learning.html">400 hunch net-2010-06-13-The Good News on Exploration and Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of truth.
 
If  n  players each play each other, you have a tournament.   How do you order the players from weakest to strongest?
 
The standard first attempt is “find the ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as possible”.  This is called the “minimum feedback arcset” problem in the CS theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem.  A basic guarantee holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some “true” intrinsic ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagrees  k  times (due to noise for instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering on at most  2k  edges (and no solution can be better).
 
One standard approach to tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an approximation guarantee.  For example,  Don Coppersmith ,  Lisa Fleischer  and  Atri Rudra  proved that  ordering players according to the number of wins is</p><p>2 0.95014775 <a title="388-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the “right” way to do machine learning.  This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.  The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a reply 2 .
 
The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and general.  Essentially, you first specify a prior  P(D)  over possible processes  D  producing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:   P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)   
After this, hard decisions are made (such as “turn left” or “turn right”) by choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior) loss.
 
This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices of  P(D)  and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice properties:
  
 There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual distribution generating the data is drawn from  P(D)  there is no better method.</p><p>3 0.94401425 <a title="388-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-06-22-Ultra_LDA.html">436 hunch net-2011-06-22-Ultra LDA</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based content.  This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where ads are specifically matched to interests.  Everyone is familiar with this, because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money this way.
 
The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on what.  A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised—in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn’t generally tell you if a different ad would have been clicked on.  This implies we have a fundamental exploration problem.
 
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “ k -Armed Bandits”, often with various relevant embellishments.  The  k -Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.  On each round:
  
 A policy chooses arm  a  from  1  of  k  arms (i.e. 1 of k ads).

<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.  This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where the world interacts with an agent as:
  
 The world announces an observation  x . 
 The agent makes a choice  a . 
 The world announces a reward  r . 
  
The goal here is to maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent.  No particular structure relating  x  to  a  or  a  to  r  is implied by this setting so we do not know effective general algorithms for the agent.  It’s very easy to prove lower bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here—just consider the case where actions are unrelated to rewards.  Nevertheless, there is a real sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this setting, somehow succeeding.

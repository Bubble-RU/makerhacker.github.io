<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>3 0.22695811 <a title="407-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana,Alexandru Niculescu, Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have donea lot
of empirical testingwhich shows thatusing all methods to make a predictionis
more powerful than using any single method. This is in rough agreement with
the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially
empirical) motivation. A rough summary is:Take all of {decision trees, boosted
decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest
neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings.Run
the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating
margins using eithersigmoid fittingorisotonic regression.For each loss of
{accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etcâ&euro;Ś}
evaluate the average performance of the method.A series of conclusions can be
drawn from the observations.(Calibrated) boosted decision trees appear to
perform best, in general although support vector machines and neural networks

<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all ofAIStatand most of
thelearning workshop, otherwise known as Snowbird, when it's atSnowbird.At
snowbird, the talk onSum-Productnetworks byHoifung Poonstood out to me (Pedro
Domingosis a coauthor.). The basic point was that by appropriately
constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in
probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible
representation+learning algorithm. As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner
than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster
and working better on an image completion task.Snowbird doesn't have real

<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An

Coates,Honglak Lee,Andrew Y. Ng(AISTATS 2011)The Importance of Encoding Versus
Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization,Adam Coates,Andrew Y.

deep learning algorithm we have. I'm not that surprised. In my experience, if
you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they
can achieve pretty good performance.Geoff Hintononce told me that the great
thing about deep belief networks is that they work. I understand that Ping had
very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some
reviewers step up to the standard of valuing what works.</p><p>2 0.75317293 <a title="407-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-23-An_Active_Learning_Survey.html">338 hunch net-2009-01-23-An Active Learning Survey</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>4 0.63375902 <a title="407-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-10-%26%238220%3BFailure%26%238221%3B_is_an_option.html">110 hunch net-2005-09-10-&#8220;Failure&#8221; is an option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.The cultural
definition of success in academic research is to:Produce good research which
many other people appreciate.Produce many students who go on to do the
same.There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.
Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs. Many students
succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think
in a similar way and appreciate your work.In order to graduate, a phd student
must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common
to adopt the culture's definition of success during this time. It's also
common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic
research lifestyle. This collision of values and abilities naturally results
in depression.The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change
something. Pick a new advisor. Pick a new research topic. Or leave the program
(and do something el</p><p>5 0.62086815 <a title="407-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-It_Doesn%26%238217%3Bt_Stop.html">295 hunch net-2008-04-12-It Doesn&#8217;t Stop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

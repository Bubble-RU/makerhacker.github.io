<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so. Since
computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise
some questions.The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient
smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is
not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply
become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI
(as opposed toGOFAIrooted in logic).Let me show by analogy whylimiting
research to computational questions is bad for any field.Except in computer
science, computational aspects play little role in the development
offundamentaltheories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice,
foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field)
theory, string theory, â&euro;Ś Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental
theory seems to be less computable th</p><p>4 0.081284985 <a title="405-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheNew York ML symposiumwas last Friday. Attendance was 268, significantly
larger thanlast year. My impression was that the event mostly still fit the
space, although it was crowded. If anyone has suggestions for next year, speak
up.The best student paper award went toSergiu Goschinfor a cool video of how
his system learned to play video games (I can't find the paper online yet).
Choosing amongst the submitted talks was pretty difficult this year, as there
were many similarly good ones.By coincidence all the invited talks were (at
least potentially) about faster learning algorithms.Stephen Boydtalked
aboutADMM.Leon Bottouspoke on single pass online learning viaaveraged SGD.Yoav
Freundtalked aboutparameter-free hedging. In Yoav's case the talk was mostly
about a better theoretical learning algorithm, but it has the potential to
unlock an exponential computational complexity improvement via oraclization of
experts algorithmsâ&euro;Ś but some serious thought needs to go in this
direction.Unrelat</p><p>5 0.065172434 <a title="405-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first
personeverto have some thought. How do you think of something that has never
been thought of? There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but
there are some tricks.The easiest method is to just have some connection come
to you. There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out
the idea immediately because it can just as easily go away.A harder method is
to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea. Distraction
elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard
work which your mind will avoid.Another common method is in conversation.
Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes
whoever you are talking to replies just the right way. This method is
dangerous though--you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than
someone who occupies your thoughts.Try to rephrase the problem so the answer
is simple. This is</p><p>6 0.061587941 <a title="405-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-18-Radford_Neal_starts_a_blog.html">313 hunch net-2008-08-18-Radford Neal starts a blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>6 0.44614547 <a title="405-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-13-The_Submodularity_workshop_and_Lucca_Professorship.html">459 hunch net-2012-03-13-The Submodularity workshop and Lucca Professorship</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sham Kakadepoints out that we are missing a bound.Suppose we
havemsamplesxdrawn IID from some distributionD. Through the magic of
exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the
deviations likeO(I/m0.5)(at least in crude form). A proof is on page 9here.If
the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying
to find a predictor with 0 expected los</p><p>5 0.52366859 <a title="405-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-27-Continuizing_Solutions.html">220 hunch net-2006-11-27-Continuizing Solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I've never
seen taught (in full generality), but which I've found very useful.Many
problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult. The best
known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean 'discretely
difficult' in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by
examples.ERMIn empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate
classifier from a set of classifiers. This is NP hard for common sets, but it
can be much harder, depending on the set.ExpertsIn the online learning with
experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of
(adversarial) experts. Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an
adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that
grows exponentially.Policy IterationThe problem with policy iteration is that

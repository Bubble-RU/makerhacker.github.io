<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>3 0.087785065 <a title="405-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  Attendance was 268, significantly larger than  last year .  My impression was that the event mostly still fit the space, although it was crowded.  If anyone has suggestions for next year, speak up.
 
The best student paper award went to  Sergiu Goschin  for a cool video of how his system learned to play video games (I can’t find the paper online yet).  Choosing amongst the submitted talks was pretty difficult this year, as there were many similarly good ones.
 
By coincidence all the invited talks were (at least potentially) about faster learning algorithms.   Stephen Boyd  talked about  ADMM .  Leon Bottou  spoke on single pass online learning via  averaged SGD .   Yoav Freund  talked about  parameter-free hedging .  In Yoav’s case the talk was mostly about a better theoretical learning algorithm, but it has the potential to unlock an exponential computational complexity improvement via oraclization of experts algorithms… but some serious</p><p>4 0.076847211 <a title="405-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>5 0.076047815 <a title="405-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-01-Interesting_papers_at_COLT_2011.html">439 hunch net-2011-08-01-Interesting papers at COLT 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since  John  did not attend  COLT  this year, I have been volunteered to report back on the hot stuff at this year’s meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all the three days. I’m gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program in a chronological order.
 
The first session on matrices seemed interesting for two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally make their entry at COLT. The paper of  Ohad  and  Shai  on  Collaborative Filtering with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducing  provides non-trivial guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina and  Nati  show how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for matrix completion problems in their paper  Concentr</p><p>6 0.075240076 <a title="405-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Summer_Schools.html">4 hunch net-2005-01-26-Summer Schools</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m not as naturally exuberant as  Muthu   2  or  David  about  CS/Econ  day, but I believe it and  ML day  were certainly successful.
 
At the CS/Econ day, I particularly enjoyed  Toumas Sandholm’s  talk which showed a commanding depth of understanding and application in automated auctions.
 
For the machine learning day, I enjoyed several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.).  What stood out to me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as “scramble to find seats”.  My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.  That isn’t the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-so posters.  Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.  
 
Are there other areas where a local Machine Learning day would fly?

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>5 0.50070465 <a title="405-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-18-Report_of_MLSS_2006_Taipei.html">203 hunch net-2006-08-18-Report of MLSS 2006 Taipei</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4, 2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245 participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see our  WIKI  for more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as organizers to screw it up too bad.  Also, since we have pretty good infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this two-week long party of machine learning.
 
In the end of MLSS we distributed a survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from participants.

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of truth.
 
If  n  players each play each other, you have a tournament.   How do you order the players from weakest to strongest?
 
The standard first attempt is “find the ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as possible”.  This is called the “minimum feedback arcset” problem in the CS theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem.  A basic guarantee holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some “true” intrinsic ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagrees  k  times (due to noise for instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering on at most  2k  edges (and no solution can be better).
 
One standard approach to tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an approximation guarantee.  For example,  Don Coppersmith ,  Lisa Fleischer  and  Atri Rudra  proved that  ordering players according to the number of wins is</p><p>4 0.5706467 <a title="405-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the “right” way to do machine learning.  This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.  The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a reply 2 .
 
The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and general.  Essentially, you first specify a prior  P(D)  over possible processes  D  producing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:   P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)   
After this, hard decisions are made (such as “turn left” or “turn right”) by choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior) loss.
 
This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices of  P(D)  and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice properties:
  
 There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual distribution generating the data is drawn from  P(D)  there is no better method.</p><p>5 0.51949859 <a title="405-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-24-Contextual_Bandits.html">269 hunch net-2007-10-24-Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based content.  This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where ads are specifically matched to interests.  Everyone is familiar with this, because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money this way.
 
The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on what.  A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised—in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn’t generally tell you if a different ad would have been clicked on.  This implies we have a fundamental exploration problem.
 
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “ k -Armed Bandits”, often with various relevant embellishments.  The  k -Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.  On each round:
  
 A policy chooses arm  a  from  1  of  k  arms (i.e. 1 of k ads).

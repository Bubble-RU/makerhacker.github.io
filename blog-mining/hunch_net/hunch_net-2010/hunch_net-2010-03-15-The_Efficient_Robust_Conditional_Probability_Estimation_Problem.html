<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.BackgroundA
reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible
(Bayes) error rateb, we get a regretr = e - b. ThePECOC(Probabilistic Error
Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regretrimplies
multiclass regret at most4r0.5.The problemThis is not the "rightest" answer.
Consider thek=2case, where we reduce binary to binary. There exists a
reduction (the identity) with the property that regretrimplies regretr. This
is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which
suggests that a better reduction may exist for generalk. For example, we can

<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single
master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.
This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where
the world interacts with an agent as:The world announces an observationx.The
agent makes a choicea.The world announces a rewardr.The goal here is to
maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent. No particular
structure relatingxtoaoratoris implied by this setting so we do not know
effective general algorithms for the agent. It's very easy to prove lower
bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here--just consider the
case where actions are unrelated to rewards. Nevertheless, there is a real
sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this
setting, somehow succeeding. The gap between these observations drives
research--How can we find tractable specializations of the master problem
general enough to provide</p><p>4 0.17700009 <a title="391-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-16-Regret_minimizing_vs_error_limiting_reductions.html">72 hunch net-2005-05-16-Regret minimizing vs error limiting reductions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious. There
are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.Error
limiting reductions. Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created
classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you
reduce to. A very simple example of this is thaterror correcting output
codeswhere it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass
error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate.Regret minimizing
reductions. Here, the goal is to bound theregretof the created classifier in
terms of theregretof the binary classifiers reduced to. The regret is the
error rate minus the minimum error rate. When the learning problem is noisy
the minimum error rate may not be0. An analagous result for reget is that for
aprobabilistic error correcting output code, multiclass regret is at most 4 *
(binary regret)0.5.The use of "regret" is more desirable than the use of error
rates, becaus</p><p>5 0.17166528 <a title="391-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-15-Alternative_Machine_Learning_Reductions_Definitions.html">236 hunch net-2007-03-15-Alternative Machine Learning Reductions Definitions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A type of prediction problem is specified by the type of samples produced by a
data source (Example:X x {0,1},X x [0,1],X x {1,2,3,4,5}, etc…) and a loss
function (0/1 loss, squared error loss, cost sensitive losses, etc…). For
simplicity, we'll assume that all losses have a minimum of zero.For this post,
we can think of a learning reduction asA mappingRfrom samples of one
typeT(like multiclass classification) to another typeT'(like binary
classification).A mappingQfrom predictors for typeT'to predictors for
typeT.The simplest sort of learning reduction is a "loss reduction". The idea
in a loss reduction is to prove a statement of the form:TheoremFor all base
predictorsb, for all distributionsDover examples of typeT:E(x,y) ~
DLT(y,Q(b,x)) <= f(E(x',y')~R(D)LT'(y',b(x')))HereLTis the loss for the
typeTproblem andLT'is the loss for the typeT'problem. Also,R(D)is the
distribution over samples induced by first drawing fromDand then mapping the
sample viaR. The functionf()is the loss transf</p><p>6 0.16923511 <a title="391-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thisproblemhas been cracked (but not quite completely solved) byAlina,Pradeep,
andI. The problem is essentially finding a better way to reduce multiclass
classification to binary classification. The solution is to use a carefully
crafted tournament, the simplest version of which is asingle elimination
tournamentwhere the "players" are the different classes. An example of the
structure is here:For the single elimination tournament, we can prove that:For
all multiclass problemsD, for all learned binary classifiersc, the regret of
an induced multiclass classifier is bounded by the regret of the binary
classifier timeslog2k. Restated:regmulticlass(D,Filter_tree_test(c)) <=

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of
truth.Ifnplayers each play each other, you have a tournament. How do you order
the players from weakest to strongest?The standard first attempt is "find the
ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as
possible". This is called the "minimum feedback arcset" problem in the CS
theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem. A basic guarantee
holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some "true" intrinsic
ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagreesktimes (due to noise for
instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering
on at most2kedges (and no solution can be better).One standard approach to
tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an
approximation guarantee. For example,Don Coppersmith,Lisa FleischerandAtri
Rudraproved thatordering players according to the number of wins is a
5-approximation to the NP-hard proble</p><p>6 0.71213305 <a title="391-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-16-Observations_on_Linearity_for_Reductions_to_Regression.html">327 hunch net-2008-11-16-Observations on Linearity for Reductions to Regression</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers that I found surprisingly interesting.Yoshua Bengio,
Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici, Hugo Larochelle,Greedy Layer-wise Training of
Deep Networks. Empirically investigates some of the design choices behind deep
belief networks.Long Zhu, Yuanhao Chen,Alan YuilleUnsupervised Learning of a
Probabilistic Grammar for Object Detection and Parsing. An unsupervised method
for detecting objects using simple feature filters that works remarkably well
on the (supervised)caltech-101 dataset.Shai Ben-David,John Blitzer,Koby
Crammer, andFernando Pereira,Analysis of Representations for Domain
Adaptation. This is the first analysis I've seen of learning with respect to
samples drawn differently from the evaluation distribution which depends on
reasonable measurable quantities.All of these papers turn out to have a common
theme--the power of unlabeled data to do generically useful things.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93304598 <a title="391-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-15-The_Efficient_Robust_Conditional_Probability_Estimation_Problem.html">391 hunch net-2010-03-15-The Efficient Robust Conditional Probability Estimation Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm offering a reward of $1000 for a solution to this problem. This joins
thecross validation problemwhich I'm offering a$500 rewardfor. I believe both
of these problems are hard but plausibly solvable, and plausibly with a
solution of substantial practical value. While it's unlikely these rewards are
worth your time on an hourly wage basis, the recognition for solving them
definitely should beThe ProblemThe problem is finding a general, robust, and
efficient mechanism for estimating a conditional probabilityP(y|x)where
robustness and efficiency are measured using techniques from learning
reductions.In particular, suppose we have access to a binary regression
oracleBwhich has two interfaces--one for specifying training information and
one for testing. Training information is specified asB(x',y')wherex'is a
feature vector andy'is a scalar in[0,1]with no value returned. Testing is done
according toB(x')with a value in[0,1]returned.A learning reduction consists of

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started theRLBench projectto setup a
suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We haven't been able to
touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold. Luckily,
there are several other projects such asCLSquareandRL-Gluewith a similar goal,
and we strongly endorse their continued development.I would like to explain
why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks. For
example, sometimes theUCI Machine Learning Repositoryis criticized. There are
two criticisms I know of:Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in
the repository. It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening
unintentionally. Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning
algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very
badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems. I
have seen little evidence of this but it remains a point of concern. There is

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>5 0.85267884 <a title="391-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-19-Choice_of_Metrics.html">259 hunch net-2007-08-19-Choice of Metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning? AsAaronnotes, the best way is to
use the loss imposed on you by the world. This turns out to be infeasible
sometimes for various reasons. The ones I've seen are:The learned prediction
is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary
to understand the prediction's impact on the loss.The prediction is used by
some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value. This is
similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity
rather than engineering modularity.The correct loss function is simply unknown
(and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation).In these situations, it's
unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen. This post has some design
advice for this murkier case. I'm using the word "metric" here to distinguish
the fact that we are considering methods forevaluatingpredictive systems
rather than a loss imposed by the real world or a loss which is optimized b</p><p>6 0.84649062 <a title="391-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>

general internationalization of science over the last few years. Withcuts to

the US become more attractive. Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the

<p>Introduction: An amusing tidbit (reproduced without permission) from Herman Chernoff's
delightful monograph, "Sequential analysis and optimal design":The use of
randomization raises a philosophical question which is articulated by the
following probably apocryphal anecdote.The metallurgist told his friend the
statistician how he planned to test the effect of heat on the strength of a
metal bar by sawing the bar into six pieces. The first two would go into the
hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool
oven. The statistician, horrified, explained how he should randomize to avoid
the effect of a possible gradient of strength in the metal bar. The method of
randomization was applied, and it turned out that the randomized experiment
called for putting the first two pieces into the hot oven, the next two into
the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. "Obviously, we can't do
that," said the metallurgist. "On the contrary, you have to do that," said the

<p>Introduction: Attendance at theNIPS workshopsis highly recommended for both research and
learning. Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of
workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of
interest:Machine Learning in FinanceLearning to RankFoundations of Active
LearningMachine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured EnvironmentsThere
aremanymore workshops. In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible
anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in. Maybe in future years
the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap.Many of
these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>5 0.64709896 <a title="396-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-01-The_Role_of_Impromptu_Talks.html">88 hunch net-2005-07-01-The Role of Impromptu Talks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLThad an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting
than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).
There are several roles that an impromptu session can play
including:Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen
now rather than later helps aid the process of research.Discussing a paper
that was rejected. Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a
means to remedy that.Entertainment. We all like to have a bit of fun.For
design, the following seem important:Impromptu speakers should not have much
time. At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well.The entire
impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and
promotes restlessness. A half hour or hour can work well.Impromptu talks are a
mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule. They will be chaotic
in content, presentation, and usefulness. The fundamental advantage of this
chaos is that it provid</p><p>6 0.51638567 <a title="396-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs. 
 
The good news from a learning perspective is that (based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at learning and learning-related fields.

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and then trying to figure out how to get there.  
 
A big part of science fiction is imagining how things could be different, and then working through the implications.  
 
Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research.  (And, hey, it’s fun.)  Here’s some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning systems:
  
 Vernor Vinge, “True Names”, “A Fire Upon the Deep” 
 Marc Stiegler, “David’s Sling”, “Earthweb” 
 Charles Stross, “Singularity Sky” 
 Greg Egan, “Diaspora” 
 Joe Haldeman, “Forever Peace” 
  
(There are surely many others.)  
 
Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.  Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series).  That didn’t really happen in the last 50 years.

<p>Introduction: Alina  and  Jake  point out the COLT  Call for Open Questions  due May 11.  In general, this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question.  In my case, I particularly enjoyed  crafting an open question  with precisely a form such that a  critic targeting my papers  would be forced to confront their fallacy or make a case for the reward.  But less esoterically, this is a way to get the attention of some very smart people focused on a problem that really matters, which is the real value.</p><p>4 0.42888206 <a title="396-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-06-Exact_Online_Learning_for_Classification.html">78 hunch net-2005-06-06-Exact Online Learning for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jacob Abernethy and I have found a computationally tractable method for computing an optimal (or near optimal depending on setting) master algorithm combining expert predictions addressing  this open problem .  A draft is  here .  
 
The effect of this improvement seems to be about a factor of  2  decrease in the regret (= error rate minus best possible error rate) for the low error rate situation.  (At large error rates, there may be no significant difference.)  
 
There are some unfinished details still to consider:
  
 When we remove all of the approximation slack from online learning, is the result a satisfying learning algorithm, in practice?  I consider online learning is one of the more compelling methods of analyzing and deriving algorithms, but that expectation must be either met or not by this algorithm 
 Some extra details: The algorithm is optimal given a small amount of side information ( k  in the draft).  What is the best way to remove this side information?

<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn  has been running the  espgame  for awhile now.  The espgame provides a picture to two randomly paired people across the web, and asks them to agree on a label.  It hasn’t managed to label the web yet, but it has produced a  large dataset  of (image, label) pairs.  I organized the dataset so you could  explore the implied bipartite graph  (requires much bandwidth).
 
Relative to other image datasets, this one is quite large—67000 images, 358,000 labels (average of 5/image with variation from 1 to 19), and 22,000 unique labels (one every 3 images).  The dataset is also very ‘natural’, consisting of images spidered from the internet.  The multiple label characteristic is intriguing because ‘learning to learn’ and metalearning techniques may be applicable.  The ‘natural’ quality means that this dataset varies greatly in difficulty from easy (predicting “red”) to hard (predicting “funny”) and potentially more rewarding to tackle.

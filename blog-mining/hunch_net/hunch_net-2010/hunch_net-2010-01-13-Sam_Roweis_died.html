<p>Introduction: A new direction of research seems to be arising in machine learning:
Interactive Machine Learning. This isn't a familiar term, although it does
include some familiar subjects.What is Interactive Machine Learning?The
fundamental requirement is (a) learning algorithms which interact with the
world and (b) learn.For our purposes, let's define learning as efficiently
competing with a large set of possible predictors. Examples include:Online
learning against an adversary (Avrim's Notes). The interaction is almost
trivial: the learning algorithm makes a prediction and then receives feedback.
The learning is choosing based upon the advice of many experts.Active
Learning. In active learning, the interaction is choosing which examples to
label, and the learning is choosing from amongst a large set of
hypotheses.Contextual Bandits. The interaction is choosing one of several
actions and learning only the value of the chosen action (weaker than active
learning feedback).More forms of interaction w</p><p>3 0.091898039 <a title="386-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-08-Some_recent_papers.html">192 hunch net-2006-07-08-Some recent papers</a></p>

my favorites. Here's a few more worth checking out:Online Multitask

and related work at an ICML Workshop on Kernel Reinforcement Learning. The big

<p>Introduction: Sam Roweis's comment reminds me of a more general issue that comes up in doing
research: abstractions always break.Real number's aren't. Most real numbers
can not be represented with any machine. One implication of this is that many
real-number based algorithms have difficulties when implemented with floating
point numbers.The box on your desk is not a turing machine. A turing machine
can compute anything computable, given sufficient time. A typical computer
fails terribly when the state required for the computation exceeds some
limit.Nash equilibria aren't equilibria. This comes up when trying to predict
human behavior based on the result of the equilibria computation. Often, it
doesn't work.Theprobabilityisn't. Probability is an abstraction expressing
either our lack of knowledge (the Bayesian viewpoint) or fundamental
randomization (the frequentist viewpoint). From the frequentist viewpoint the
lack of knowledge typically precludes actually knowing the fundamental
randomization. Fro</p><p>6 0.075265534 <a title="386-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-21-Ben_Taskar_is_gone.html">491 hunch net-2013-11-21-Ben Taskar is gone</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I would like to point out 3 graduates this season as having my confidence they
are capable of doing great things.Daniel Hsuhas diverse papers with diverse
coauthors on {active learning, mulitlabeling, temporal learning, â&euro;Ś} each
covering new algorithms and methods of analysis. He is also a capable
programmer, having helped me with some nitty-gritty details of cluster
parallelVowpal Wabbitthis summer. He has an excellent tendency to just get
things done.Nicolas Lambertdoesn't nominally work in machine learning, but
I've found his work inelicitationrelevant nevertheless. In essence, elicitable
properties are closely related to learnable properties, and the elicitation
complexity is related to a notion of learning complexity. See theSurrogate
regret bounds paperfor some related discussion. Few people successfully work
at such a general level that it crosses fields, but he's one of them.Yisong

<p>Introduction: We just finished theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School. The school
was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.
For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning
class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previousMLSSs have been close).
Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on
this. For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian
friends. EmailMrs Spela Sitarof the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details.The
following are some notes for future planning and those interested.Good

House. Our attendance came in well above our expectations, so this was a

<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.97207856 <a title="386-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:Updating
toWordPress1.5.Installing and heavily tweaking theGeeknichetheme. Update: I
switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme.Adding theCustomizable
Post Listingsplugin.Installing theStatTraqplugin.Updating some of the links. I
particularly recommend looking at thecomputer research
policyblog.Addingthreaded comments. This doesn't thread old comments
obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones.Overall, I

<p>Introduction: Slashdotpoints outGoogle Predict. I'm not privy to the details, but this has
the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an
easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.
This differs goalwise fromMLcomp--instead of public comparisons for research
purposes, it's about private utilization of good existing algorithms. It also
differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less
awkward than using Amazon's cloud computing. The latter implies that datasets
several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by
network and storage.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.9469071 <a title="386-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-13-Sam_Roweis_died.html">386 hunch net-2010-01-13-Sam Roweis died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: and I can't help but remember him.I first metSamas an undergraduate
atCaltechwhere he was TA forHopfield's class, and again when I visitedGatsby,
when he invited me to visitToronto, and at too many conferences to recount.
His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great
ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.87384784 <a title="386-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>

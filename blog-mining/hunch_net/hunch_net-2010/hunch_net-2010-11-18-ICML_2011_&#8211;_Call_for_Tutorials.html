<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due
January 18, two weeks before papers.Similarly,Ben Taskaris looking for

subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught
essence, a vital part of the research process. Tutorials are due February 13,

<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkermaninitiated an effort to create anedited book on parallel machine
learningthatMishaand I have been helping with. The breadth of efforts to
parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small
fraction initially.This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide
array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together asurvey tutorial
on the subject of parallel learningforKDD, tomorrow. This tutorial
isnotlimited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms
have come out since we started inviting chapters.This tutorial should interest
anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data,
anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has
bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth(Also note
the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of
trying to speed up learning algorithms. We have almost no overlap.)</p><p>4 0.14916208 <a title="417-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-13-AIStats.html">409 hunch net-2010-09-13-AIStats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>6 0.1100748 <a title="417-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-12-01-NIPS_tutorials_and_Vowpal_Wabbit_7.4.html">492 hunch net-2013-12-01-NIPS tutorials and Vowpal Wabbit 7.4</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of

<p>Introduction: One part of doing research is debugging your understanding of reality. This is
hard work: How do you even discover where you misunderstand? If you discover a
misunderstanding, how do you go about removing it?The process of debugging
computer programs is quite analogous to debugging reality misunderstandings.
This is natural--a bug in a computer program is a misunderstanding between you
and the computer about what you said. Many of the familiar techniques from
debugging have exact parallels.DetailsWhen programming, there are often signs
that some bug exists like: "the graph my program output is shifted a little
bit" = maybe you have an indexing error. In debugging yourself, we often have
some impression that something is "not right". These impressions should be
addressed directly and immediately. (Some people have the habit of suppressing
worries in favor of excess certainty. That's not healthy for research.)Corner

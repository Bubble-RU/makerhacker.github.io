<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>3 0.16344744 <a title="415-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-09-NYAS_ML_Symposium_this_year..html">377 hunch net-2009-11-09-NYAS ML Symposium this year.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  NYAS ML symposium  grew again this year to 170 participants, despite the need to outsmart or otherwise tunnel through  a crowd .  
 
Perhaps the most distinct talk was by Bob Bell on various aspects of the  Netflix prize  competition.  I also enjoyed several student posters including  Matt Hoffman ‘s cool examples of blind source separation for music.
 
I’m somewhat surprised how much the workshop has grown, as it is now comparable in size to a small conference, although in style more similar to a workshop.  At some point as an event grows, it becomes owned by the community rather than the organizers, so if anyone has suggestions on improving it, speak up and be heard.</p><p>4 0.15233022 <a title="415-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-04-15-NEML_II.html">481 hunch net-2013-04-15-NEML II</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adam Kalai  points out the  New England Machine Learning Day  May 1 at MSR New England.  There is a poster session with abstracts due April 19.  I understand last year’s  NEML  went well and it’s great to meet your neighbors at regional workshops like this.</p><p>5 0.1411458 <a title="415-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>

 May 19 in New York ,  STOC  is coming to town and  rather surprisingly having  workshops  which should be quite a bit of fun.

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>3 0.73801404 <a title="415-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-29-Key_Scientific_Challenges_and_the_Franklin_Symposium.html">457 hunch net-2012-02-29-Key Scientific Challenges and the Franklin Symposium</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For graduate students, the  Yahoo!   Key Scientific Challenges program  including in  machine learning  is on again,  due March 9 .  The application is easy and the $5K award is high quality “no strings attached” funding.   Consider submitting.
 
Those in Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York, may consider attending the  Franklin Institute Symposium   April 25  which has several speakers and an award for  V .  Attendance is free with an RSVP.</p><p>4 0.72004747 <a title="415-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism_as_a_Disease.html">153 hunch net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism as a Disease</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the AI-related parts of machine learning, it is often tempting to examine how  you  do things in order to imagine how a machine should do things.  This is introspection, and it can easily go awry.  I will call introspection gone awry introspectionism.
 
Introspectionism is almost unique to AI (and the AI-related parts of machine learning) and it can lead to huge wasted effort in research.  It’s easiest to show how introspectionism arises by an example.
 
Suppose we want to solve the problem of navigating a robot from point A to point B given a camera.  Then, the following research action plan might seem natural when you examine your own capabilities:
  
 Build an edge detector for still images. 
 Build an object recognition system given the edge detector. 
 Build a system to predict distance and orientation to objects given the object recognition system. 
 Build a system to plan a path through the scene you construct from {object identification, distance, orientation} predictions.</p><p>5 0.67477715 <a title="415-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-30-ICML_papers.html">188 hunch net-2006-06-30-ICML papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are some ICML papers which interested me.
  
  Arindam Banerjee  had a  paper  which notes that PAC-Bayes bounds, a core theorem in online learning, and the optimality of Bayesian learning statements share a core inequality in their proof. 
  Pieter Abbeel ,  Morgan Quigley  and  Andrew Y. Ng  have a  paper  discussing RL techniques for learning given a bad (but not too bad) model of the world. 
  Nina Balcan  and  Avrim Blum  have a  paper  which discusses how to learn given a similarity function rather than a kernel.  A similarity function requires less structure than a kernel, implying that a learning algorithm using a similarity function might be applied in situations where no effective kernel is evident. 
  Nathan Ratliff ,  Drew Bagnell , and  Marty Zinkevich  have a  paper  describing an algorithm which attempts to fuse A *  path planning with learning of transition costs based on human demonstration.

with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other

<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>5 0.57370251 <a title="406-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-01-Interesting_papers_at_COLT_2011.html">439 hunch net-2011-08-01-Interesting papers at COLT 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: SinceJohndid not attendCOLTthis year, I have been volunteered to report back
on the hot stuff at this year's meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty
high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all
the three days. I'm gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program
in a chronological order.The first session on matrices seemed interesting for
two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this
is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing
literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally
make their entry at COLT. The paper ofOhadandShaionCollaborative Filtering
with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducingprovides non-trivial
guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina
andNatishow how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for
matrix completion problems in their paperConcentration-Based Guarantees for

<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated. I've taken the opportunity to upgrade
the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.Old threaded comments
are now flattened. The system we used to use (Brian's threaded comments)
appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress. I
haven't yet figured out a workaround.I setup afeedburner account.I added an
RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like
to follow. This is something that I've wanted to do for awhile.Many other
minor changes in font and format, with some help fromAlina.If you have any
suggestions for site tweaks, please speak up.</p><p>2 0.86542147 <a title="406-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-01-Peekaboom.html">99 hunch net-2005-08-01-Peekaboom</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luishas releasedPeekabooma successor toESPgame(game site). The purpose of the
game is similar--using the actions of people playing a game to gather data
helpful in solving AI.Peekaboom gathers more detailed, and perhaps more
useful, data about vision. For ESPgame, the byproduct of the game was mutually
agreed upon labels for common images. For Peekaboom, the location of the
subimage generating the label is revealed by the game as well. Given knowledge
about what portion of the image is related to a label it may be more feasible
learn to recognize the appropriate parts.There isn't a dataset yet available
for this game as there is for ESPgame, but hopefully a significant number of
people will play and we'll have one to work wtih soon.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.861287 <a title="406-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-22-KDD_2010.html">406 hunch net-2010-08-22-KDD 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane
Lambert,Evaluating Online Ad Campaigns in a Pipeline: Causal Models At
ScaleThis paper</p><p>4 0.73284012 <a title="406-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-02-User_preferences_for_search_engines.html">423 hunch net-2011-02-02-User preferences for search engines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic
queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com
using Internet Explorer with the Bing toolbar and later noticed some synthetic
responses from B</p><p>5 0.73185539 <a title="406-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-18-Report_of_MLSS_2006_Taipei.html">203 hunch net-2006-08-18-Report of MLSS 2006 Taipei</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>6 0.73148364 <a title="406-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-10-ML_Symposium_and_ICML_details.html">447 hunch net-2011-10-10-ML Symposium and ICML details</a></p>

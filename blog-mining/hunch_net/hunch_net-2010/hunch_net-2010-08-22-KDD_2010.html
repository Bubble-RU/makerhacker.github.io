<p>Introduction: I attended  KDD  this year.  The conference has always had a strong grounding in what works based on the  KDDcup , but it has developed a halo of workshops on various subjects.  It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.
 
There were several papers that other people might like to take a look at.

Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>4 0.16120297 <a title="406-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>5 0.13317721 <a title="406-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for all sorts of tasks where it either wasn’t previously collected, or for tasks that did not previously exist.  While this is great for Machine Learning, it has a downside—the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead to substantial privacy problems.  
 
It’s important to understand that this is a much harder problem than many people appreciate.  The  AOL   data   release  is a good example.  To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be obvious:
  
 Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable information.  The logic here seems to be “if I can’t easily find the person then no one can”.  That doesn’t work as demonstrated by the people who were found circumstantially from the AOL data. 
 … then just hash all the search terms!  The logic here is “if I can’t read it, then no one can”.  It’s also trivially broken by a dictionary attack—just hash all the strings</p><p>6 0.13161792 <a title="406-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-26-NIPS_2010.html">420 hunch net-2010-12-26-NIPS 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I enjoyed attending  NIPS  this year, with several things interesting me.  For the conference itself:
  
  Peter Welinder ,  Steve  Branson ,  Serge Belongie , and  Pietro Perona ,  The Multidimensional Wisdom of Crowds .  This paper is about using  mechanical turk  to get label information, with results superior to a majority vote approach. 
  David McAllester ,  Tamir Hazan , and  Joseph Keshet   Direct Loss Minimization for Structured Prediction .  This is about another technique for directly optimizing the loss in structured prediction, with an application to speech recognition.  
  Mohammad Saberian  and  Nuno Vasconcelos   Boosting Classifier Cascades .  This is about an algorithm for simultaneously optimizing loss and computation in a classifier cascade construction.  There were several other papers on cascades which are worth looking at if interested.

<p>Introduction: and I can’t help but remember him.
 
I first met  Sam  as an undergraduate at  Caltech  where he was TA for  Hopfield ‘s class, and again when I visited  Gatsby , when he invited me to visit  Toronto , and at too many conferences to recount.  His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great ability to phrase a problem so it’s solution must be understood.  With respect to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to make  my first tutorial , leading to others, and to other things, all of which I’m grateful to him for.  In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.
 
His death is  being called a suicide  which is so incompatible with my understanding of Sam that it strains my credibility.  But we know that his many responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane researchers have legions of inner doubts.  Having been depressed now and then myself, it’s helpful to understand at least intellectually</p><p>2 0.92112881 <a title="406-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alex Smola  showed me this  ICML 2006  webpage.  This is  NOT  the ICML we know, but rather some people at “Enformatika”.  Investigation shows that they registered with an anonymous yahoo email account from  dotregistrar.com  the “Home of the $6.79 wholesale domain!” and their nameservers are by  Turkticaret , a Turkish internet company.
 
It appears the website has since been altered to “ ICNL ” (the above link uses the google cache).
 
They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so the organizers of the real  ICML 2006  must feel quite flattered.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.8808679 <a title="406-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-22-KDD_2010.html">406 hunch net-2010-08-22-KDD 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting at  KDD this year .  The ones that caught my attention are:
  
  Xin Jin , Mingyang Zhang,  Nan Zhang , and  Gautam Das ,  Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation .  This paper provides a conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not violate privacy rules in a natural language.  It is not differentially private, so no external sources of join information can exist.  However, it is a mechanism for  publishing  data rather than (say) the output of a learning algorithm. 
  Arik Friedman   Assaf Schuster ,  Data Mining with Differential Privacy .  This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision trees.  Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as it was  defined in 2006 .

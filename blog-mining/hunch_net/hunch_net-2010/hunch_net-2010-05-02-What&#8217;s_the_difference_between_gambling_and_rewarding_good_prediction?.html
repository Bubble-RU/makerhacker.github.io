<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own
experience is that a basic attitude of "no child unrealized" is better than

<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the formFORn=1,2,â&euro;Ś:-- Reality
chooses a datumxn.-- Decision Maker chooses his decisiondn.-- Reality chooses
an observationyn.-- Decision Maker suffers lossL(yn,dn).END FOR.The
observationyncan be, for example, tomorrow's stock price and the decisiondnthe
number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy. The datumxnideally contains
all information that might be relevant in making this decision. We do not want
to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and
data.Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision ruleDmapping each
datumxto a decisionD(x). Can we perform as well, or almost as well, asD,
without knowing it? This is essentially a special case of the problem ofon-
line learning.This is a simple result of this kind. Suppose the dataxnare
taken from [0,1] andL(y,d)=|y-d|. A norm ||h|| of a functionhon [0,1] is

<p>Introduction: One view of machine learning is that it's about how to program computers to
predict well. This suggests a broader research program centered around the
more pervasive goal of simply predicting well.There are many distinct strands
of this broader research program which are only partially unified. Here are
the ones that I know of:Learning Theory. Learning theory focuses on several
topics related to the dynamics and process of prediction. Convergence bounds
like theVC boundgive an intellectual foundation to many learning algorithms.
Online learning algorithms likeWeighted Majorityprovide an alternate purely
game theoretic foundation for learning.Boosting algorithmsyield algorithms for
purifying prediction abiliity.Reduction algorithmsprovide means for changing
esoteric problems into well known ones.Machine Learning. A great deal of
experience has accumulated in practical algorithm design from a mixture of
paradigms, including bayesian, biological, optimization, and
theoretical.Mechanism De</p><p>5 0.12126136 <a title="397-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.

<p>Introduction: At many points in research, you face a choice: should I keep on improving some
old piece of technology or should I do something new? For example:Should I
refine bounds to make them tighter?Should I take some learning theory and turn
it into a learning algorithm?Should I implement the learning algorithm?Should
I test the learning algorithm widely?Should I release the algorithm as source
code?Should I go see what problems people actually need to solve?The universal
temptation of people attracted to research is doing something new. That is
sometimes the right decision, but is also often not. I'd like to discuss some
reasons why not.ExpertiseOnce expertise are developed on some subject, you are
the right person to refine them.What is the real problem?Continually improving
a piece of technology is a mechanism forcing you to confront this question. In
many cases, this confrontation is uncomfortable because you discover that your
method has fundamental flaws with respect to solving the real p</p><p>5 0.57883453 <a title="397-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At NIPS,Andrew Ngasked me what should be in a large scale learning class.
After some discussion with him andNandoand mulling it over a bit, these are
the topics that I think should be covered.There are many different kinds of
scaling.Scaling in examplesThis is the most basic kind of scaling.Online
Gradient DescentThis is an old algorithm--I'm not sure if anyone can be
credited with it in particular. Perhaps thePerceptronis a good precursor, but
substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of
whichsquared loss,logistic loss, Hinge Loss, andQuantile Lossare all worth
covering. It's important to cover thesemanticsof these loss functions as
well.Vowpal Wabbitis a reasonably fast codebase implementing these.Second

second derivative information can be more effective. I've seen preconditioned
conjugate gradient work well, for whichJonathan Shewchuck'swriteupis

<p>Introduction: Textbooks invariably seem to carry the proof that uses Markov's inequality,
moment-generating functions, and Taylor approximations. Here's an easier
way.For, letbe the KL divergence between a coin of biasand one of
bias:Theorem:Suppose you doindependent tosses of a coin of bias. The
probability of seeingheads or more, for, is at most. So is the probability of
seeingheads or less, for.Remark:By Pinsker's inequality,.ProofLet's do
thecase; the other is identical.Letbe the distribution overinduced by a coin
of bias, and likewisefor a coin of bias. Letbe the set of all sequences
oftosses which containheads or more. We'd like to show thatis unlikely

<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>4 0.86390334 <a title="397-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-21-Presentation_Preparation.html">249 hunch net-2007-06-21-Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience
prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.The rate of flow of concepts simply
exceeds the infor</p><p>5 0.80985594 <a title="397-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-22-Explicit_Randomization_in_Learning_algorithms.html">219 hunch net-2006-11-22-Explicit Randomization in Learning algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate
randomness into their execution. This includes at amongst others:Neural
Networks. Neural networks use randomization to assign initial
weights.Boltzmann Machines/Deep Belief Networks. Boltzmann machines are
something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression. The use
of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines, because the predicted
value at test time also uses randomness.Bagging. Bagging is a process where a
learning algorithm is run several different times on several different
datasets, creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote.Policy
descent. Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such asConservative
Policy Iterationuse random bits to create stochastic policies.Experts
algorithms. Randomized weighted majority use random bits as a part of the
prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees.A basic question
is: "Should there be explicit randomization in learn</p><p>6 0.78222442 <a title="397-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>

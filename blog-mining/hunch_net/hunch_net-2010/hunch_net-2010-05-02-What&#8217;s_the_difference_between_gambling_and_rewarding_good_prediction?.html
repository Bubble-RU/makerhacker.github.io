</p><p>2 ”   We  discussed this before the financial crisis . [sent-5, score-0.451]
</p><p>3 The basic mapping is between “wealth” and “weight”, with the essential idea that you can think of wealth as either money or degree of control over decision making. [sent-8, score-0.756]
</p><p>4 The core algorithms start with a “wealth” spread over many experts, each of which makes predictions and then has it’s wealth updated according to a soft exponential of the value of it’s prediction. [sent-9, score-0.498]
</p><p>5 This strategy is not inherently sound from a learning theory point of view, because a single purchased item can sometimes drop to zero value. [sent-12, score-0.539]
</p><p>6 In the zero value case, a good decision maker can be wiped out by one decision, while in the large value case, a lucky decision maker can randomly achieve overwhelming credit. [sent-15, score-0.74]
</p><p>7 If each item purchased either doubles or halves in value, the fluctuation in the wealth of a decision maker is analogous to the fluctuation in the relative weight of on an expert in the online learning framework. [sent-17, score-1.185]
</p><p>8 Adding diversification to the “Long” strategy helps it align substantially better with an optimal learning theory strategy. [sent-20, score-0.439]
</p><p>9 The short strategy is borrowing an item (typically a stock), selling it high, then buying it back low to cover the debt. [sent-23, score-0.702]
</p><p>10 From the perspective of learning theory, short selling is more dangerous than long, because it’s possible to end up with negative wealth when a stock is sold short, and then it increases in value. [sent-26, score-0.807]
</p><p>11 If this collateral is at least twice the value when shorting occurs, it’s hard for participants to become wealthy by luck, because wealth at most doubles. [sent-28, score-0.672]
</p><p>12 In the financial crisis, credit default swaps made the crisis viral, as the “pay up” clauses triggered, particularly wiping out  AIG . [sent-32, score-0.838]
</p><p>13 Insurance has the same general problem as short selling—it can result in negative wealth unless there is sufficient collateral. [sent-33, score-0.658]
</p><p>14 The first is that for normal people interacting with the financial system a set of financial rules + good sense have developed such that wealth tends to grow and shrink in a manner similar to what learning theory would suggest is near optimal. [sent-41, score-1.27]
</p><p>15 For example, most people use the going long strategy by default and most diversify. [sent-42, score-0.442]
</p><p>16 Normal people don’t have access to credit default swaps, and normal insurance has real collateral requirements. [sent-44, score-0.696]
</p><p>17 The second is that larger actors have become quite skillful at avoiding the rules, with unsecured credit default swaps, unsecured shorts, and no clawback rules. [sent-46, score-0.624]
</p><p>18 My belief is effective financial reform will impose limits on agents just as learning theory implies. [sent-48, score-0.58]
</p><p>19 But this needn’t be so, because the math is straightforward, very robust, and designed precisely to pick out the good decision makers giving them wealth as rapidly as responsibly possible to make and control bigger decisions. [sent-54, score-0.573]
</p><p>20 Some basic questions are: How can we better structure marketplaces to allocate wealth according to the dynamics of an online learning algorithm? [sent-57, score-0.463]

<p>Introduction: I’ve avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest.  The problem with discussing politics is that it’s customary for people to say much based upon little information.  Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa).  It’s primary election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the issues are not.
 
There are several policy decisions which substantially effect development of science and technology in the US.
  
  Education  The US has great contrasts in education.  The top universities are very good places, yet the grade school education system produces mediocre results.  For me, the contrast between a  public education  and  Caltech  was bracing.  For many others attending Caltech, it clearly was not.  Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about.  My own experience is that a basic attitude of “no child unrealized” i</p><p>3 0.14352575 <a title="397-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-07-On-line_learning_of_regular_decision_rules.html">118 hunch net-2005-10-07-On-line learning of regular decision rules</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the form 
FOR  n =1,2,…: 
— Reality chooses a datum  x n  . 
— Decision Maker chooses his decision  d n  . 
— Reality chooses an observation  y n  . 
— Decision Maker suffers loss   L ( y n  , d n  ). 
END FOR. 
The observation  y n   can be, for example, tomorrow’s stock price and the decision  d n   the number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy.  The datum  x n   ideally contains all information that might be relevant in making this decision.  We do not want to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and data.
 
Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision rule  D  mapping each datum  x  to a decision  D ( x ).  Can we perform as well, or almost as well, as  D , without knowing it?  This is essentially a special case of the problem of  on-line learning .
 
This is a simple result of this kind.  Suppose the data  x n   are taken from [0,1] and  L ( y , d )=| y – d |.

<p>Introduction: One view of machine learning is that it’s about how to program computers to predict well.  This suggests a broader research program centered around the more pervasive goal of simply predicting well. 
There are many distinct strands of this broader research program which are only partially unified.  Here are the ones that I know of:
  
  Learning Theory .  Learning theory focuses on several topics related to the dynamics and process of prediction.  Convergence bounds like the  VC bound   give an intellectual foundation to many learning algorithms.  Online learning algorithms like  Weighted Majority  provide an alternate purely game theoretic foundation for learning.   Boosting algorithms  yield algorithms for purifying prediction abiliity.   Reduction algorithms  provide means for changing esoteric problems into well known ones. 
  Machine Learning .  A great deal of experience has accumulated in practical algorithm design from a mixture of paradigms, including bayesian, biological, opt</p><p>5 0.12242673 <a title="397-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining itself as fundamental and important.  In all the cases I know of, they are both right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).
  
 Politics.  This is the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment.  “What could be more important than the process of making decisions?” 
 Science and Technology.  This is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with.  “The loss of modern science and technology would be catastrophic.” 
 Military.  “Without the military, a nation will be invaded and destroyed.” 
 (insert your favorite here) 
  
Within science and technology, the same thing happens again.
  
 Mathematics. “What could be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?” 
 Physics.  “Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.  Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else.” 
 Biology.  “Without life, we wouldn’t be here, so clearly the s</p><p>6 0.099853635 <a title="397-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic.  The truth is even worse—the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in ways that will require much more significant reform than  is being considered now .
 
The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while making the invention available to all.  This myth sounds pretty desirable, but the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.
 
There are many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two of them: 
  
  Patent Trolls   The way that patents have generally worked over the last several decades is that they were a tool of large companies.  Large companies would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other’s patents—in effect saying “we agree to owe each other nothing”.  Smaller companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they</p><p>3 0.67320114 <a title="397-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.  This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mec</p><p>6 0.60021824 <a title="397-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-08-Online_Learning_as_the_Mathematics_of_Accountability.html">109 hunch net-2005-09-08-Online Learning as the Mathematics of Accountability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After a  major financial crisis , there is much discussion about how  finance has become a casino  gambling with other’s money, keeping the winnings, and walking away when the money is lost.  
 
When thinking about financial reform, all the many losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed.  But, a more thoughtful view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most likely to make right decisions are making them.  A crucial question then is: “What is the  difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?”
 
We  discussed this before the financial crisis . The cheat-sheet sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm, and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this question.  What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of financial t</p><p>2 0.78921098 <a title="397-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Paper_Deadlines.html">11 hunch net-2005-02-02-Paper Deadlines</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation and theoretical understanding.
 
 Method   K-fold cross validation is a commonly used technique which takes a set of  m  examples and partitions them into  K  sets (“folds”) of size  m/K .  For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other folds and then test on the fold.
 
 Problem   Assume only independent samples.  Derive a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error rate.
 
 Past Work  (I’ll add more as I remember/learn.)
  
  Devroye , Rogers, and Wagner analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds.  Not all of this is online, but here is one  paper .  
  Michael Kearns  and  Dana Ron   analyzed cross validation  and found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test set of size  m/K  .  
  Avrim Blum,   Adam Kalai , and  myself   analyzed cross validation  and found tha</p><p>4 0.71793652 <a title="397-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-08-Online_Learning_as_the_Mathematics_of_Accountability.html">109 hunch net-2005-09-08-Online Learning as the Mathematics of Accountability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem.  When someone screws up, do you fire them?  Or do you accept the error and let them continue?  This is a very difficult problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.
 
 Online learning  (as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the online learning model.  
 
In the online learning model, there are a set of hypotheses or “experts”.  On any instantance  x , each expert makes a prediction  y .  A master algorithm  A  uses these predictions to form it’s own prediction  y A   and then  learns the correct prediction  y *  .  This process repeats.
 
The goal of online learning is to find a master algorithm  A  which uses the advice of the experts to make good predictions.  In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert.  If  L(e)  is the loss of expert  e  and  L(A)  is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to prove:   L(A) les</p><p>5 0.69204402 <a title="397-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-05-An_ICML_reject.html">177 hunch net-2006-05-05-An ICML reject</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hal ,  Daniel , and I have been working on the algorithm  Searn  for structured prediction.  This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML, and we were quite surprised.  By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an interesting algorithm.
  
 Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature set.  This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their papers. 
 Theoretical underpinning.  Searn is a reduction which comes with a reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good performance for the overall system.  No other theorem of this type has been made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know. 
 Speed. Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we tested against. 
 Simplicity.  Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to</p><p>6 0.535927 <a title="397-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-06-Exact_Online_Learning_for_Classification.html">78 hunch net-2005-06-06-Exact Online Learning for Classification</a></p>

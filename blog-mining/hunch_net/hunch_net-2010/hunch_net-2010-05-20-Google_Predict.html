<p>Introduction: Much of the success and popularity of machine learning has been driven by its practical impact. Of course, the evaluation of empirical work is an integral part of the field. But are the existing mechanisms for evaluating algorithms and comparing results good enough? We ( Percy  and  Jake ) believe there are currently a number of shortcomings:  

  
  Incomplete Disclosure:  You read a paper that proposes Algorithm A which is shown to outperform SVMs on two datasets.  Great.  But what about on other datasets?  How sensitive is this result?   What about compute time – does the algorithm take two seconds on a laptop or two weeks on a 100-node cluster? 
  Lack of Standardization:  Algorithm A beats Algorithm B on one version of a dataset.  Algorithm B beats Algorithm A on another version yet uses slightly different preprocessing.  Though doing a head-on comparison would be ideal, it would be tedious since the programs probably use different dataset formats and have a large array of options</p><p>3 0.10323177 <a title="399-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>

Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

<p>Introduction: … and you should use that fact.
 
A workshop differs from a conference in that it is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic.  It also differs in that a workshop is typically a “one-time affair” rather than a series.  (The  Snowbird learning workshop  counts as a conference in this respect.)  
 
A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop is to treat it as a conference.  This is “ok”, but it is not really taking advantage of the situation.  Here are some things I’ve learned:
  
 For speakers: A smaller audience means it can be more interactive.  Interactive means a better chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation (because you can adapt to your audience).  Greater focus amongst the participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and discuss tradeoffs more carefully.  Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued than newness. 
 For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference st</p><p>6 0.078074567 <a title="399-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-02-%241M_Netflix_prediction_contest.html">211 hunch net-2006-10-02-$1M Netflix prediction contest</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Various people want to use hunch.net to announce things.  I’ve generally resisted this because I feared hunch becoming a pure announcement zone while I am much more interested contentful posts and discussion personally.  Nevertheless there is clearly some value and announcements are easy, so I’m planning to summarize announcements on Mondays.
  
  D. Sculley  points out an interesting  Semisupervised feature learning  competition, with a deadline of October 17.  
  Lihong Li  points out the  webscope user interaction dataset  which is the first high quality exploration dataset I’m aware of that is publicly available. 
 Seth Rogers points out  CrossValidated  which looks similar in conception to  metaoptimize , but directly using the  stackoverflow  interface and with a bit more of a statistics twist.</p><p>3 0.54210037 <a title="399-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-14-MLcomp%3A_a_website_for_objectively_comparing_ML_algorithms.html">393 hunch net-2010-04-14-MLcomp: a website for objectively comparing ML algorithms</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied machine learning using current technology.  We just built a small one at TTI so this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design choices.
  
  Architecture   There are several architectural choices.
 
 AMD Athlon64 based system.  This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck.  Maximum RAM is typically 2-3GB. 
 AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB of RAM.  The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type. 
 Intel PIV or Xeon based system.  The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the above 2.  Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit hotter and be a bit more expensive. 
 Dual core chips.  Both Intel and AMD have chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them. 

In the end, we decided to go with option (2).  Roughly speaking,</p><p>5 0.4732461 <a title="399-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-30-Concerns_about_the_Large_Scale_Learning_Challenge.html">300 hunch net-2008-04-30-Concerns about the Large Scale Learning Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  large scale learning challenge  for ICML interests me a great deal, although I have concerns about the way it is structured.
 
From the  instructions page , several issues come up:
  
  Large Definition   My personal definition of dataset size is:
 
  small   A dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly find a good solution. 
  medium   A dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a reasonably priced computer. 
  large  A large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a reasonably priced computer. 
 

By this definition, all of the datasets are medium sized.  This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe it is more than that.


The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible.  From small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm degrades.  From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning algorithms that don’t require ran</p><p>6 0.45782524 <a title="399-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-18-What_is_missing_for_online_collaborative_research%3F.html">208 hunch net-2006-09-18-What is missing for online collaborative research?</a></p>

  Elad Hazan  and  Comandur Seshadhri   Efficient learning algorithms for changing environments  at ICML.  This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies.  The definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many situation. 
  Hal Daume ,  Unsupervised Search-based Structured Prediction  at ICML.  This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b)  makes semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.  
 There were two papers with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear regression, both reducing the sample complexity to .  One was  Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi ,  Claudio Gentile , and  Francesco Orabona   Robust Bounds for Classification via Selective Sampling  at ICML and the other was  Thoma</p><p>3 0.74363399 <a title="399-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-09-Graduates_and_Postdocs.html">490 hunch net-2013-11-09-Graduates and Postdocs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.
  
  Alekh Agarwal  made the  most scalable public learning algorithm  as an intern two years ago.  He has a deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the ability and will to make things happen programming-wise.  I’ve been privileged to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed. 
  John Duchi  created  Adagrad  which is a commonly helpful improvement over online gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including in  Vowpal Wabbit .  He has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with significant industry experience at  Google .  Alekh and John have often coauthored together. 
  Stephane Ross  visited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many new algorithms and working out the first  scale free online update rule  which is now the default in Vowpal Wabbit.  Stephane is  not  on the market—Google robbed the cradle successfully    I’m sure that</p><p>4 0.73737669 <a title="399-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive. 
 Tutorials are a good way to gain some understanding of a long-standing direction of research.  They are generally more coherent than workshops.   ICML has 7  and  AAAI has 15 .</p><p>5 0.70119452 <a title="399-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-07-A_NIPS_paper.html">330 hunch net-2008-12-07-A NIPS paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m skipping NIPS this year in favor of  Ada , but I wanted to point out  this paper  by  Andriy Mnih  and  Geoff Hinton .  The basic claim of the paper is that by carefully but automatically constructing a binary tree over words, it’s possible to predict words well with huge computational resource savings over unstructured approaches.
 
I’m interested in this beyond the application to word prediction because it is relevant to the general normalization problem: If you want to predict the probability of one of a large number of events, often you must compute a predicted score for all the events and then normalize, a computationally inefficient operation.  The problem comes up in many places using probabilistic models, but I’ve run into it with high-dimensional regression.
 
There are a couple workarounds for this computational bug:
  
 Approximate. There are many ways.  Often the approximations are uncontrolled (i.e. can be arbitrarily bad), and hence finicky in application. 
 Avoid.  Y</p><p>6 0.69190425 <a title="399-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-18-Multiplication_of_Learned_Probabilities_is_Dangerous.html">157 hunch net-2006-02-18-Multiplication of Learned Probabilities is Dangerous</a></p>

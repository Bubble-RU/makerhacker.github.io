<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: One view of machine learning is that it's about how to program computers to
predict well. This suggests a broader research program centered around the
more pervasive goal of simply predicting well.There are many distinct strands
of this broader research program which are only partially unified. Here are
the ones that I know of:Learning Theory. Learning theory focuses on several
topics related to the dynamics and process of prediction. Convergence bounds
like theVC boundgive an intellectual foundation to many learning algorithms.
Online learning algorithms likeWeighted Majorityprovide an alternate purely
game theoretic foundation for learning.Boosting algorithmsyield algorithms for
purifying prediction abiliity.Reduction algorithmsprovide means for changing
esoteric problems into well known ones.Machine Learning. A great deal of
experience has accumulated in practical algorithm design from a mixture of
paradigms, including bayesian, biological, optimization, and
theoretical.Mechanism De</p><p>6 0.078643128 <a title="399-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-14-MLcomp%3A_a_website_for_objectively_comparing_ML_algorithms.html">393 hunch net-2010-04-14-MLcomp: a website for objectively comparing ML algorithms</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale learning challengefor ICML interests me a great deal, although
I have concerns about the way it is structured.From theinstructions page,
several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly
find a good solution.mediumA dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.largeA large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.By this definition, all of the datasets are medium
sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning
algorithms that don't require random access to examples.No Loading TimeThe

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>4 0.46236289 <a title="399-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-02-%241M_Netflix_prediction_contest.html">211 hunch net-2006-10-02-$1M Netflix prediction contest</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The notationg(n) = O(f(n))means that in the limit asnapproaches infinity there
exists a constantCsuch that theg(n)is less thanCf(n).In learning theory, there
are many statements about learning algorithms of the form "under
assumptionsx,y, andz, the classifier learned has an error rate of at
mostO(f(m))".There is one very good reason to use O(): it helps you understand
the big picture and neglect the minor details which are not important in the
big picture. However, there are some important reasons not to do this as
well.UnspeedupIn algorithm analysis, the use of O() for time complexity is
pervasive and well-justified. Determining the exact value of C is inherently
computer architecture dependent. (The "C" for x86 processors might differ from
the "C" on PowerPC processors.) Since many learning theorists come from a CS
theory background, the O() notation is applied to generalization error. The
O() abstraction breaks here--you can not generally change learning algorithm

<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.96818191 <a title="399-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>

ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.8563112 <a title="399-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Apparently, the companySpockis setting up a$50k entity resolution challenge.
$50k is much less than the Netflix challenge, but it's effectively the same as
Netflix untilsomeone reaches 10%. It's also nice that the Spock challenge has
a short duration. The (visible) test set is of size 25k and the training set
has size 75k.</p><p>4 0.10464901 <a title="389-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I attended theNetflix prizeceremony this morning. The press conference part
iscovered fine elsewhere, with the basic outcome being thatBellKor's Pragmatic
Chaoswon overThe Ensembleby 15-20minutes, because they were tied in
performance on the ultimate holdout set. I'm sure the individual participants
will have many chances to speak about the solution. One of these is Bell at
theNYAS ML symposium on Nov. 6.Several additional details may interest ML
people.The degree of overfitting exhibited by the difference in performance on
theleaderboard test setand the ultimate hold out set was small, but
determining at .02 to .03%.A tie was possible, because the rules cut off
measurements below the fourth digit based on significance concerns. In
actuality, of course, the scores do differ before rounding, but everyone I
spoke to claimed not to know how. The complete dataset has beenreleased on
UCI, so each team could compute their own score to whatever accuracy desired.I

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released theKey Scientific Challengesprogram. There is aMachine
Learninglist I worked on and aStatisticslist whichDeepakworked on.I'm hoping
this is taken quite seriously by graduate students. The primary value, is that
it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research
which would be valuable to make progress on. A good strategy for a beginning
graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make
substantial advances for a PhD. The directions are sufficiently general that
I'm sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.A secondary
point, (which I'm sure is primary for many) is that there is money for
graduate students here. It's unrestricted, so you can use it for any
reasonable travel, supplies, etcâ&euro;Ś</p><p>4 0.49219877 <a title="389-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-29-Key_Scientific_Challenges_and_the_Franklin_Symposium.html">457 hunch net-2012-02-29-Key Scientific Challenges and the Franklin Symposium</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>6 0.43273064 <a title="389-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just releasedVowpal Wabbit 6.0. Since the last version:VW is now 2-3 orders
of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks toAlekh. Given the
baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature
datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects. The core
improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters
(eitherHadoopor not). This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with
clusters of size 2 (and doesn't hurt for clusters of size 1). The core
allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused--we've already used it to
parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.
We'll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now
"README_cluster" and associated scripts should provide a good starting
point.The newLBFGScode fromMiroseems to commonly dominate the existing
conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.The new matrix factorization
code fromJakeadds a core algor</p><p>3 0.79976946 <a title="389-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate_Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning.html">302 hunch net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate Mathematics for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction
between:Anopen setand aclosed set.ASupremumand aMaximum.An event which happens
with probability 1 and an event that always happens.I don't appreciate this
distinction in machine learning & learning theory. All machine learning takes
place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.
Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and
probability 1 events always happen.The fundamental issue here is that
substantial parts of mathematics don't appear well-matched to computation in
the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.
This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions. We can ask "what
mathematics is appropriate to computation?"Andrejhas convinced me that a
pretty good answer to this question isconstructive mathematics.So, here's a
basic challenge: Can anyone name a situation where any of the distinctions
above (or simila</p><p>4 0.77771348 <a title="389-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-23-Jonathan_Chang_at_Slycoder.html">350 hunch net-2009-04-23-Jonathan Chang at Slycoder</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest
people.TheKey Scientific Challengesprogram (due March 5) forMachine
LearningandStatisticsoffers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working
on a core problem of interest to Y! If you are already working on one of these
problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you aren't you might want
to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary
of the possible in Machine Learning. There are 7 days left.TheLearning to Rank
challenge(due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm
on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at
an ICML workshop. Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd,
3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreakthe ensembleencountered. If
you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all
learn something. There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.66615808 <a title="389-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-26-NIPS_2010.html">420 hunch net-2010-12-26-NIPS 2010</a></p>

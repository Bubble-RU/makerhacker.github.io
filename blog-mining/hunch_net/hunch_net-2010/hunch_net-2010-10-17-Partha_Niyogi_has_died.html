<p>Introduction: Carnegie MellonSchool of Computer Sciencehas the first academicMachine
Learning department. This department already existed as theCenter for
Automated Learning and Discovery, but recently changed it's name.The reason
for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as
"Automated Learner and Discoverers", but there are number of people who think
of themselves as "Machine Learners". Machine learning is both more succinct
and recognizable--good properties for a name.A more interesting question is
"Should there be a Machine Learning Department?".Tom Mitchellhas a
relevantwhitepaperclaiming that machine learning is answering a different
question than other fields or departments. The fundamental debate here is "Is
machine learning different from statistics?"At a cultural level, there is no
real debate: they are different. Machine learning is characterized by several
very active large peer reviewed conferences, operating in a computer science
mode. Statistics tends to fun</p><p>3 0.10604537 <a title="414-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example
of th</p><p>4 0.087323785 <a title="414-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-10-Best_Practices_for_Collaboration.html">231 hunch net-2007-02-10-Best Practices for Collaboration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people, especially students, haven't had an opportunity to collaborate
with other researchers. Collaboration, especially with remote people can be
tricky. Here are some observations of what has worked for me on collaborations
involving a few people.Travel and DiscussAlmost all collaborations start with
in-person discussion. This implies that travel is often necessary. We can hope
that in the future we'll have better systems for starting collaborations
remotely (such as blogs), but we aren't quite there yet.Enable your
collaborator. A collaboration can fall apart because one collaborator disables
another. This sounds stupid (and it is), but it's far easier than you might
think.Avoid Duplication. Discovering that you and a collaborator have been
editing the same thing and now need to waste time reconciling changes is
annoying. The best way to avoid this to be explicit about who has write
permission to what. Most of the time, a write lock is held for the entire
document, just to be s</p><p>5 0.080993369 <a title="414-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-30-Many_ways_to_Learn_this_summer.html">357 hunch net-2009-05-30-Many ways to Learn this summer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are at least3summer schools related to machine learning this summer.The
firstis atUniversity of ChicagoJune 1-11 organized byMisha Belkin,Partha
Niyogi, andSteve Smale. Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met
their capacity limit. The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.
I was particularly interested to seeValiantamongst the speakers. I'm also
presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction.Praveen
Srinivasanpoints out the second atPeking Universityin Beijing, China, July
20-27.This onediffers substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning,
and their intersection. The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15. This
is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active
support fromNSF.The third one is atCambridge, England, August 29-September 10.
It's in theMLSS series. Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about
the Bayesian side of ML, although effort has been made to create a good cross

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>3 0.59866035 <a title="414-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>4 0.57734585 <a title="414-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-11-26-Giving_Thanks.html">449 hunch net-2011-11-26-Giving Thanks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>5 0.57462829 <a title="414-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-15-The_Machine_Learning_Department.html">228 hunch net-2007-01-15-The Machine Learning Department</a></p>

9,abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposiumare due. Send a 2 page
pdf, if interested, and note that we:widened submissions to be from anybody
rather than students.set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed
submissions.September 15, there is amachine learning meetup, where I'll be
discussing terascale learning at AOL.September 16, there is aCS&Econ; dayat New
York Academy of Sciences. This is not ML focused, but it's easy to imagine
interest.September 23 and laterNIPS workshopsubmissions start coming due. As
usual, there are too many good ones, so I won't be able to attend all those
that interest me. I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming
summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you. Here are a few that
interest me:Big Learningis about dealing with lots of data. Abstracts are

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>same-blog 4 0.86421895 <a title="414-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-17-Partha_Niyogi_has_died.html">414 hunch net-2010-10-17-Partha Niyogi has died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: from brain cancer. I askedMishawho worked with him to write about it.Partha
Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43.I first met
Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in
math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics
at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a
somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I
asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new
to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We
made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially
just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation.
I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity
and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus for
inquiries wo</p><p>5 0.82746184 <a title="414-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side
synchronized slides &</p><p>6 0.8114835 <a title="414-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-21-Regretting_the_dead.html">411 hunch net-2010-09-21-Regretting the dead</a></p>

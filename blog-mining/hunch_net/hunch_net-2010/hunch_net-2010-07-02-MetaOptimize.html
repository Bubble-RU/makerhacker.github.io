<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.  This isn’t necessarily</p><p>4 0.099798188 <a title="402-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-02-Retrospective.html">225 hunch net-2007-01-02-Retrospective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time.

<p>Introduction: A big ouch—all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle.  Rajnish sends the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
 
——————————————————————————
 
Sincere apologies to ICML community for loosing 2012 archived videos
 
What happened: In order to publish 2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service, the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had ignored while removing the data from previous server.
 
What are we doing about this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make sure this does not happen again in future: 
(1) We are going to create a channel on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p- or slide-vers</p><p>3 0.67295432 <a title="402-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-14-NIPS_workshp%3A_Learning_Problem_Design.html">265 hunch net-2007-10-14-NIPS workshp: Learning Problem Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alina  and I are organizing a workshop on  Learning Problem Design  at  NIPS .  
 
 What is learning problem design?  Itâ&euro;&trade;s about being clever in creating learning problems from otherwise unlabeled data.  Read the webpage above for examples.

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron. 
 We may not need to simulate a human brain to achieve AI.  Ther</p><p>5 0.43788975 <a title="402-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-30-NIPS_workshops_are_out..html">264 hunch net-2007-09-30-NIPS workshops are out.</a></p>

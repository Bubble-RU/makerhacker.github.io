<p>Introduction: Slashdotpoints outGoogle Predict. I'm not privy to the details, but this has
the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an
easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.
This differs goalwise fromMLcomp--instead of public comparisons for research
purposes, it's about private utilization of good existing algorithms. It also
differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less
awkward than using Amazon's cloud computing. The latter implies that datasets
several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by
network and storage.</p><p>4 0.13213325 <a title="418-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-11-Interesting_papers_at_KDD.html">364 hunch net-2009-07-11-Interesting papers at KDD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attendedKDDthis year. The conference has always had a strong grounding in
what works based on theKDDcup, but it has developed a halo of workshops on
various subjects. It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets
machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.There were
several papers that other people might like to take a look at.Yehuda
KorenCollaborative Filtering with Temporal Dynamics. This paper describes how
to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering
approaches. This was also a best paper award.D. Sculley, Robert Malkin,Sugato

<p>Introduction: Some of the "sister conference" presentations atAAAIhave been great. Roughly
speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come
give a summary of their conference. Many different AI-related conferences
accepted. The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of
the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked. This is
great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work
of several thousand researchers--something which is simply available nowhere
else.Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant
component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning inAIIDE,IUI,
andACL.There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event
similar toFCRC, but centered on AI & Learning. This seems like a fine idea.
The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of
a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>5 0.4385677 <a title="418-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-09-The_Stock_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Problem.html">193 hunch net-2006-07-09-The Stock Prediction Machine Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum
(basically, everyone wins).</p><p>6 0.43227932 <a title="418-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-29-Deadline_Season.html">145 hunch net-2005-12-29-Deadline Season</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due
January 18, two weeks before papers.Similarly,Ben Taskaris looking for
goodtutorials, which is complementary. Workshops are about exploring a
subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught
essence, a vital part of the research process. Tutorials are due February 13,
two weeks after papers.</p><p>4 0.93304265 <a title="418-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of

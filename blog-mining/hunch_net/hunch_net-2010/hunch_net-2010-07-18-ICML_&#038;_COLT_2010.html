<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attending  ICML , except for  Dora  who arrived on Monday.  Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is going well.
 
For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like everyone),  Mark Reid  has setup the  ICML discussion  site where you can comment on any paper or subscribe to papers.  Authors are automatically subscribed to their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly after the fact, as people desire.
 
We also conducted a survey before the conference and have the  survey results  now.  This can be compared with the  ICML 2010 survey results .  Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4 being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and 2010.

<p>Introduction: Normally, I don’t indulge in posters for  ICML , but this year is naturally an exception for me.   If you want one, there are a small number  left here , if you sign up before February.
 
It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting papers.  At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers.  Program chairs setup the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the reviewing process.  Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the community determine the conference.  Nevertheless, as a program chair this year it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to encourage (and occasionally discourage).
 
At the highest level, I believe ICML exists to further research into machine learning, which I gene</p><p>4 0.19224717 <a title="403-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

  Elad Hazan  and  Comandur Seshadhri   Efficient learning algorithms for changing environments  at ICML.  This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies.  The definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many situation. 
  Hal Daume ,  Unsupervised Search-based Structured Prediction  at ICML.  This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b)  makes semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.  
 There were two papers with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear regression, both reducing the sample complexity to .

<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most at  ICML  and  COLT  2010 were:
  
  Thomas Walsh ,  Kaushik Subramanian ,  Michael Littman  and  Carlos Diuk   Generalizing Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes .  This paper formalizes and provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that perform better than for either setting alone. 
  István Szita  and  Csaba Szepesvári   Model-based reinforcement learning with nearly tight exploration complexity bounds .  This paper and  another represent the frontier of best-known algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process. 
  James Martens   Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization .  About a new not-quite-online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional structures.  Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.

<p>Introduction: (I’m channeling for  Jean-Yves Audibert  here, with some minor tweaking for clarity.)
 
Since  Nemirovski’s   Saint Flour lecture notes , numerous researchers have studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well as 
  (MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice; model = finite set of d functions) 
  (C) the best convex combination of these functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions) 
  (L) the best linear combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d functions) 
It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov’s COLT’03 paper) that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n for (L), where n is the training set size.  Here, “risk” is amount of extra loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.
 
The practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial</p><p>3 0.88374424 <a title="403-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-21-Presentation_Preparation.html">249 hunch net-2007-06-21-Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference.  Since many people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial challenge.  Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about preparing a presentation on research.
  
  Motivate .  Talks which don’t start by describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out. 
  Prioritize .  It is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much.  This is an easy-to-understand failure mode as it’s very natural to want to include everything.  A basic fact is: you can’t.  Example of this are:
 
 Your slides are so densely full of equations and words that you can’t cover them. 
 Your talk runs over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off. 
 You motor-mouth through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>5 0.82228655 <a title="403-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-05-ICML_acceptance_statistics.html">466 hunch net-2012-06-05-ICML acceptance statistics</a></p>

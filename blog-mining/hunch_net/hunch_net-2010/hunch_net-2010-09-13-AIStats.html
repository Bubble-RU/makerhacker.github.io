<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon made an interesting presentation at the  snowbird learning workshop  discussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several robot-related learning problems.    There seems to be a draft  here .  This seems interesting in two ways:
  
  Drawback Removal  One of the significant problems with these online algorithms is that they can’t cope with structure very easily.  This drawback is addressed for certain structures. 
  Experiments  One criticism of such algorithms is that they are too “worst case”.   Several experiments suggest that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a great loss.</p><p>5 0.1252861 <a title="409-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-15-COLT_Open_Problems.html">292 hunch net-2008-03-15-COLT Open Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLT has a  call for open problems  due March 21.  I encourage anyone with a specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in.  Just the effort of specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it.  To increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the solution.  (Perhaps I should raise the  $500 bounty  on the  K-fold cross-validation problem  as it hasnâ&euro;&trade;t yet been solved).</p><p>6 0.1244738 <a title="409-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Platt , who is PC-chair for  NIPS 2006  has organized a  NIPS paper evaluation criteria  document with input from the  program committee  and others.  
 
The document contains specific advice about what is appropriate for the various subareas within NIPS.  It may be very helpful, because the standards of evaluation for papers varies significantly.  
 
This is a bit of an experiment: the hope is that by carefully thinking about and stating what is important, authors can better understand whether and where their work fits.

<p>Introduction: There are at least  3  summer schools related to machine learning this summer.
  
  The first  is at  University of Chicago  June 1-11 organized by  Misha Belkin ,  Partha Niyogi , and   Steve Smale .  Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met their capacity limit.  The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.  I was particularly interested to see  Valiant  amongst the speakers.  I’m also presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction. 
  Praveen Srinivasan  points out the second at  Peking University  in Beijing, China, July 20-27.   This one  differs substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning, and their intersection.  The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15.  This is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active support from  NSF . 
 The third one is at  Cambridge , England, August 29-September 10.  It’s in the  MLSS series .  Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about the Bayesian side of ML, alth</p><p>3 0.54108357 <a title="409-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-27-NYAS_ML_2012_and_ICML_2013.html">472 hunch net-2012-08-27-NYAS ML 2012 and ICML 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>5 0.12171558 <a title="409-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-15-COLT_Open_Problems.html">292 hunch net-2008-03-15-COLT Open Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLT has acall for open problemsdue March 21. I encourage anyone with a
specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in. Just the effort of
specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for
my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it. To
increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the
solution. (Perhaps I should raise the$500 bountyon theK-fold cross-validation

<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are
finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a
zero-sum game between different participants. This is not a viewpoint that I
want to promote, as I consider it flawed. However, I know several people
believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have substantial
explanatory power.For example:It explains why your paper was rejected based on
poor logic. The reviewer wasn't concerned with research quality, but rather
with rejecting a competitor.It explains why professors rarely work together.
The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case
for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours.It
explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted. Adopting a
competitor's program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor
being wrong.Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint
in different degrees</p><p>6 0.44490999 <a title="409-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over. AAAI
and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing
techniques.Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year. It
seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.For theoretical papers,
with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs. This is very hard to
cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the
authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket "reject" hits many probably-good
papers. Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent
to double blind conferences.On the author side, double blind reviewing is
actually somewhat disruptive to research. In particular, it discourages the
author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of
research. This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously
appreciated.Author feedback: AAAI and ICML did author feedback this year. It

<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum
(basically, everyone wins).</p><p>4 0.73602909 <a title="409-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-13-Avoiding_Bad_Reviewing.html">40 hunch net-2005-03-13-Avoiding Bad Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question
is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a
few things I've learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a
reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind
yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation). The
significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close attention
to a paper. Since</p><p>5 0.63912642 <a title="409-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-24-Mass_Customized_Medicine_in_the_Future%3F.html">314 hunch net-2008-08-24-Mass Customized Medicine in the Future?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.Right now, a
new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or
not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization. The outcome is
observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better
than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a
standard treatment.Generalizing this, a filterFsorts people into two groups:
those for treatmentAand those not for treatmentBbased upon observationsx. To
measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of
groupAand measure the relative performance of the treatment.A problem often
arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated
group. A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad? With respect
to the filterFit may mean that, but with respect to another filterF', the

<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.29511073 <a title="390-tfidf-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for all sorts of tasks where it either wasn’t previously collected, or for tasks that did not previously exist.  While this is great for Machine Learning, it has a downside—the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead to substantial privacy problems.  
 
It’s important to understand that this is a much harder problem than many people appreciate.  The  AOL   data   release  is a good example.  To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be obvious:
  
 Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable information.  The logic here seems to be “if I can’t easily find the person then no one can”.  That doesn’t work as demonstrated by the people who were found circumstantially from the AOL data. 
 … then just hash all the search terms!  The logic here is “if I can’t read it, then no one can”.  It’s also trivially broken by a dictionary attack—just hash all the strings</p><p>3 0.19041228 <a title="390-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-02-User_preferences_for_search_engines.html">423 hunch net-2011-02-02-User preferences for search engines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the “Bing copies Google” discussion  here ,  here , and  here , because there are data-related issues which the general public may not understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.
 
As a not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have.  I work at  Yahoo! , which has started using  Bing .  This might predispose me towards Bing, but on the other hand I’m still at Yahoo!, and have been using  Linux  exclusively as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches.  And,  on the gripping hand , I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about the basic  principles of incorporating user feedback in machine learning .  Also note, this post is not  related to official Yahoo! policy, it’s just my personal view.

<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting at  KDD this year .  The ones that caught my attention are:
  
  Xin Jin , Mingyang Zhang,  Nan Zhang , and  Gautam Das ,  Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation .  This paper provides a conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not violate privacy rules in a natural language.  It is not differentially private, so no external sources of join information can exist.  However, it is a mechanism for  publishing  data rather than (say) the output of a learning algorithm. 
  Arik Friedman   Assaf Schuster ,  Data Mining with Differential Privacy .  This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision trees.  Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as it was  defined in 2006 .

I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.97274977 <a title="390-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-31-Remote_large_scale_learning_class_participation.html">479 hunch net-2013-01-31-Remote large scale learning class participation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yann and I have arranged so that people who are interested in our  large scale machine learning class  and not able to attend in person can follow along via two methods.
  
  Videos  will be posted with about a 1 day delay on  techtalks .  This is a side-by-side capture of video+slides from  Weyond . 
 We are experimenting with  Piazza  as a discussion forum.  Anyone is welcome to subscribe to Piazza and ask questions there, where I will be monitoring things.   update2 : Sign up  here . 
  
The first lecture is up now, including the  revised version of the slides  which fixes a few typos and rounds out references.</p><p>3 0.97219616 <a title="390-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>4 0.9322927 <a title="390-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Makc asked a good  question  in comments—”Why bother to make a paper, at all?”  There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately obvious to people not in academia.
 
The basic idea is that papers have considerably more utility than the obvious “present an idea”.
  
 Papers are a formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged on the number of papers they produce. 
 Papers have a formalized method of citing and crediting other—the bibliography.  Academics (especially older ones) are often judged on the number of citations they receive. 
 Papers enable a “more fair” anonymous review.  Conferences receive  many  papers, from which a subset are selected.  Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants to build a reputation for good work. 
 Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.  Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to friends about interesting problems while there.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.85582876 <a title="390-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-02-Progress_in_Active_Learning.html">127 hunch net-2005-11-02-Progress in Active Learning</a></p>

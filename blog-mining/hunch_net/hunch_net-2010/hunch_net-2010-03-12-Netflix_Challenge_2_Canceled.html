<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for
all sorts of tasks where it either wasn't previously collected, or for tasks
that did not previously exist. While this is great for Machine Learning, it
has a downside--the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead
to substantial privacy problems.It's important to understand that this is a
much harder problem than many people appreciate. TheAOLdatareleaseis a good
example. To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be
obvious:Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable
information. The logic here seems to be "if I can't easily find the person
then no one can". That doesn't work as demonstrated by the people who were
found circumstantially from the AOL data.â€¦ then just hash all the search
terms! The logic here is "if I can't read it, then no one can". It's also
trivially broken by a dictionary attack--just hash all the strings that might

<p>Introduction: I attendedKDDthis year. The conference has always had a strong grounding in
what works based on theKDDcup, but it has developed a halo of workshops on
various subjects. It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets
machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.There were
several papers that other people might like to take a look at.Yehuda

to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering

<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane
Lambert,Evaluating Online Ad Campaigns in a Pipeline: Causal Models At

theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.97152567 <a title="390-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:Updating
toWordPress1.5.Installing and heavily tweaking theGeeknichetheme. Update: I
switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme.Adding theCustomizable
Post Listingsplugin.Installing theStatTraqplugin.Updating some of the links. I
particularly recommend looking at thecomputer research
policyblog.Addingthreaded comments. This doesn't thread old comments
obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones.Overall, I
think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of myearlier problems. If
you have any difficulties or anything seems "not quite right", please speak
up. A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>3 0.96618801 <a title="390-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-20-Google_Predict.html">399 hunch net-2010-05-20-Google Predict</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Slashdotpoints outGoogle Predict. I'm not privy to the details, but this has
the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an
easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.
This differs goalwise fromMLcomp--instead of public comparisons for research
purposes, it's about private utilization of good existing algorithms. It also
differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less
awkward than using Amazon's cloud computing. The latter implies that datasets
several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by
network and storage.</p><p>4 0.93447 <a title="390-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-13-Sam_Roweis_died.html">386 hunch net-2010-01-13-Sam Roweis died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: and I can't help but remember him.I first metSamas an undergraduate
atCaltechwhere he was TA forHopfield's class, and again when I visitedGatsby,
when he invited me to visitToronto, and at too many conferences to recount.
His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great
ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.87094122 <a title="390-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>

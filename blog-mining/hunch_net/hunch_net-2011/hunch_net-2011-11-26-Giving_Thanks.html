<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: If you search for “online learning” with any  major   search   engine , it’s interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.  This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering.  In other words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9 results.  The essential observation here is that the process of human learning is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.  
 
The internet is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider two possibilities:
  
 The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is, with many teachers for the same subject. 
 All the teachers for one subject get together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in online delivery.  They spend a factor of 4 more time designing</p><p>4 0.13090563 <a title="449-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process.  This easiest way to see this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred. There is no known succesful mechanism for “mass producing” PhDs as is done (in some sense) for undergraduate and masters study.  Here are a few hints that might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own experience.
  
  Masters or PhD  (a) You want a PhD if you want to do research.  (b) You want a masters if you want to make money.  People wanting (b) will be manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.  People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long process. 
  Attitude .   Many  students struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude towards research.  Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know something via assignments, tests, etc…  Research does  not  work this way.

<p>Introduction: Since we last discussed  the other online learning ,  Stanford  has very visibly started pushing mass teaching in  AI ,  Machine Learning , and  Databases .  In retrospect, it’s not too surprising that the next step up in serious online teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a university embedded in the land of startups.  Numbers on the order of  100000  are quite significant—similar in scale to the number of  computer science undergraduate students/year  in the US.  Although these populations surely differ, the fact that they  could  overlap is worth considering for the future.  
 
It’s too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are many easy criticisms to make:
  
  Registration != Learning   … but if only 1/10th complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any traditional process. 
  1st year excitement != nth year routine  … but if only 1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpass</p><p>5 0.69776398 <a title="449-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-10-%26%238220%3BFailure%26%238221%3B_is_an_option.html">110 hunch net-2005-09-10-&#8220;Failure&#8221; is an option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.
 
The cultural definition of success in academic research is to:
  
 Produce good research which many other people appreciate. 
 Produce many students who go on to do the same. 
  
There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.   Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs.  Many students succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think in a similar way and appreciate your work.
 
In order to graduate, a phd student must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common to adopt the culture’s definition of success during this time.  It’s also common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic research lifestyle.  This collision of values and abilities naturally results in depression.
 
The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change something.  Pick a new advisor.  Pick a new research topic.

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.
 
As a researcher, I am most thankful for my education, without which I could not function.  I want to share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.
  
 My long term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I get is particularly useful. 
 I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down details until I fully understand things.  Natural obsessiveness can go wrong, of course, but it’s a great ally when you absolutely must get things right. 
 My childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated.  I’m not sure how important this was since travel has it’s own benefits, but it bears thought. 
 I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed</p><p>2 0.87136251 <a title="449-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-13-The_Submodularity_workshop_and_Lucca_Professorship.html">459 hunch net-2012-03-13-The Submodularity workshop and Lucca Professorship</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nina  points out the  Submodularity Workshop   March 19-20  next week at  Georgia Tech .  Many people want to make Submodularity the new Convexity in machine learning, and it certainly seems worth exploring.

<p>Introduction: The  Exponentiated Gradient  algorithm by  Manfred Warmuth  and  Jyrki Kivinen  came out just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference and in class.  It’s a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical statement accompanying it.
 
The essential statement holds in the “online learning with an adversary” setting.  Initially, there are of set of  n  weights, which might have values  (1/n,…,1/n) , (or any other values from a probability distribution).  Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion.  On each round, the following happens:
  
 The world reveals a set of features  x in {0,1} n  .  In the online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called “experts” and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn’t necessary—you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature value and the negation of the feature value as two experts). 
 EG makes a prediction according to  y’ = w . x  (dot product).

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially touchy subject.  Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought about carefully.
 
There are a few things which should be understood:
  
 The system is changing and responsive.  We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC, and even we-the-NIPS-board.  NIPS has implemented ‘secondary program chairs’, ‘author response’, and ‘double blind reviewing’ in the last few years to help with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future. 
 Agreement creates a perception of correctness.  When any PC meets and makes a group decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness.  For the many people who have been on the NIPS PC it’s reasonable to entertain a healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty. 
 This post is about structural problems.  What problems arise because of the structure</p><p>5 0.70242381 <a title="449-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance.

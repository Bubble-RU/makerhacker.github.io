</p><p>10 I ended up a year advanced, taking math from our local community college during senior year in high school. [sent-16, score-0.448]

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>3 0.1458029 <a title="449-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you search for "online learning" with anymajorsearchengine, it's
interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.
This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering. In other
words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting
top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people
interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9
results. The essential observation here is that the process of human learning
is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.The internet
is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider
two possibilities:The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is,
with many teachers for the same subject.All the teachers for one subject get
together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in
online delivery. They spend a factor of 4 more time designing the perfect

<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process. This easiest way to see
this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred.
There is no known succesful mechanism for "mass producing" PhDs as is done (in
some sense) for undergraduate and masters study. Here are a few hints that
might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own
experience.Masters or PhD(a) You want a PhD if you want to do research. (b)
You want a masters if you want to make money. People wanting (b) will be
manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.
People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long
process.Attitude.Manystudents struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude
towards research. Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of
schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know
something via assignments, tests, etcâ&euro;Ś Research doesnotwork this way. Research

<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.The cultural
definition of success in academic research is to:Produce good research which
many other people appreciate.Produce many students who go on to do the
same.There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.
Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs. Many students
succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think
in a similar way and appreciate your work.In order to graduate, a phd student
must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common
to adopt the culture's definition of success during this time. It's also
common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic
research lifestyle. This collision of values and abilities naturally results
in depression.The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change
something. Pick a new advisor. Pick a new research topic. Or leave the program

<p>Introduction: Since we last discussedthe other online learning,Stanfordhas very visibly
started pushing mass teaching inAI,Machine Learning, andDatabases. In
retrospect, it's not too surprising that the next step up in serious online
teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a
university embedded in the land of startups. Numbers on the order of100000are
quite significant--similar in scale to the number ofcomputer science
undergraduate students/yearin the US. Although these populations surely
differ, the fact that theycouldoverlap is worth considering for the
future.It's too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are
many easy criticisms to make:Registration != Learning… but if only 1/10th
complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any
traditional process.1st year excitement != nth year routine… but if only
1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of
any traditional process.Hello, che</p><p>6 0.65501505 <a title="449-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-03-Conference_attendance_is_mandatory.html">66 hunch net-2005-05-03-Conference attendance is mandatory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>2 0.8168717 <a title="449-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-26-NIPS_workshops.html">375 hunch net-2009-10-26-NIPS workshops</a></p>

Learning, and Experimental Designdue 10/27.Discrete Optimization in Machine
Learning: Submodularity, Sparsity & Polyhedra, due Nov. 6.Large-Scale Machine
Learning: Parallelism and Massive Datasets, due 10/23 (i.e. past)Analysis and
Design of Algorithms for Interactive Machine Learning, due 10/30.And I'm sure
many of the others interest others. Workshops are great as a mechanism for
research, so take a look if there is any chance you might be interested.</p><p>3 0.81678998 <a title="449-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-23-What_is_the_best_regret_transform_reduction_from_multiclass_to_binary%3F.html">181 hunch net-2006-05-23-What is the best regret transform reduction from multiclass to binary?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.BackgroundA
reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible
(Bayes) error rateb, we get a regretr = e - b. ThePECOC(Probabilistic Error
Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regretrimplies
multiclass regret at most4r0.5.The problemThis is not the "rightest" answer.
Consider thek=2case, where we reduce binary to binary. There exists a
reduction (the identity) with the property that regretrimplies regretr. This
is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which
suggests that a better reduction may exist for generalk. For example, we can
not rule out the possibility that a reductionRexists with regret transform
guaranteeing binary regretrimp</p><p>4 0.77560103 <a title="449-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheExponentiated Gradientalgorithm byManfred WarmuthandJyrki Kivinencame out
just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference
and in class. It's a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical
statement accompanying it.The essential statement holds in the "online
learning with an adversary" setting. Initially, there are of set ofnweights,
which might have values(1/n,â&euro;Ś,1/n), (or any other values from a probability
distribution). Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion. On each round,
the following happens:The world reveals a set of featuresx in {0,1}n. In the
online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called
"experts" and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn't
necessary--you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature
value and the negation of the feature value as two experts).EG makes a
prediction according toy' = w . x(dot product).The world reveals the truthy in
[0,1].EG updates the weights</p><p>5 0.74412149 <a title="449-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Williamsonand I are the learning theory PC members atNIPSthis year. This
is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers. I
think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:Making community
standards a matter of public record seems healthy. It give us a chance to
debate what is and is not the right standard. It might even give us a bit more
consistency across the years.It may save us all time. There are a number of
papers submitted which just aren't there yet. Avoiding submitting is the right
decision in this case.There are several criteria for judging a paper. All of
these were active this year. Some criteria are uncontroversial while others
may be so.The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which
it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results. A
surprising number of papers fail this test. This criteria seems essential to
the definition of "theory".Missing theorem statementMissing proofThis isn't an</p><p>6 0.74195385 <a title="449-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

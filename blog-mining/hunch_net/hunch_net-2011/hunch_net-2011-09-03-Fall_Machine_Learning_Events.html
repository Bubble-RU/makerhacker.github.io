Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an

etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.12746276 <a title="443-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-07-17-MUCMD_and_BayLearn.html">470 hunch net-2012-07-17-MUCMD and BayLearn</a></p>

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>4 0.68097866 <a title="443-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.September
9,abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposiumare due. Send a 2 page
pdf, if interested, and note that we:widened submissions to be from anybody
rather than students.set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed
submissions.September 15, there is amachine learning meetup, where I'll be
discussing terascale learning at AOL.September 16, there is aCS&Econ; dayat New
York Academy of Sciences. This is not ML focused, but it's easy to imagine
interest.September 23 and laterNIPS workshopsubmissions start coming due. As
usual, there are too many good ones, so I won't be able to attend all those
that interest me. I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming
summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you. Here are a few that
interest me:Big Learningis about dealing with lots of data. Abstracts are

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>4 0.66634786 <a title="443-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side
synchronized slides &</p><p>5 0.6491338 <a title="443-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-17-Partha_Niyogi_has_died.html">414 hunch net-2010-10-17-Partha Niyogi has died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: from brain cancer. I askedMishawho worked with him to write about it.Partha
Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43.I first met
Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in
math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics
at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a
somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I
asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new
to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We
made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially
just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation.
I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity
and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus for
inquiries wo</p><p>6 0.61244547 <a title="443-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-21-Regretting_the_dead.html">411 hunch net-2010-09-21-Regretting the dead</a></p>

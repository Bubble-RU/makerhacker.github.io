<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.

<p>Introduction: Adam Kalai  points out the  New England Machine Learning Day  May 1 at MSR New England.  There is a poster session with abstracts due April 19.  I understand last year’s  NEML  went well and it’s great to meet your neighbors at regional workshops like this.</p><p>5 0.16964696 <a title="443-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>6 0.15262148 <a title="443-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-07-17-MUCMD_and_BayLearn.html">470 hunch net-2012-07-17-MUCMD and BayLearn</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:
 
  Big Learning  is about dealing with lots of data.  Abstracts are due  September 30 .

<p>Introduction: I will join  Yahoo Research  (in New York) after my contract ends at  TTI-Chicago .
 
The deciding reasons are:
  
 Yahoo is running into many hard learning problems.  This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to have the greatest impact. 
 Yahoo Research understands research including publishing, conferences, etc… 
 Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I can help it grow well. 
 Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at all limited to) experimenting with research blogs. 
  
In the end, Yahoo Research seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest difference.  
 
Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research.  We-the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible.  I’ll certainly have fun trying.</p><p>3 0.70674711 <a title="443-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-23-%28Dis%29similarities_between_academia_and_open_source_programmers.html">105 hunch net-2005-08-23-(Dis)similarities between academia and open source programmers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martin Pool  and I recently discussed the similarities and differences between academia and open source programming.   
 
Similarities:
  
  Cost profile   Research and programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort is required to produce something useful, and then “anyone” can use it.  (The “anyone” is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently technical people could use it.) 
  Wealth profile  A “wealthy” academic or open source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in research or programs.  Much of academia is a “gift culture”: whoever gives the most is most respected. 
  Problems   Both academia and open source programming suffer from similar problems.
 
 Whether or not (and which) open source program is used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability or usefulness.  Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to directions of research. 
 Funding is often a problem for</p><p>4 0.69063914 <a title="443-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-06-Structured_Regret_Minimization.html">53 hunch net-2005-04-06-Structured Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon made an interesting presentation at the  snowbird learning workshop  discussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several robot-related learning problems.    There seems to be a draft  here .  This seems interesting in two ways:
  
  Drawback Removal  One of the significant problems with these online algorithms is that they can’t cope with structure very easily.  This drawback is addressed for certain structures. 
  Experiments  One criticism of such algorithms is that they are too “worst case”.   Several experiments suggest that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a great loss.</p><p>5 0.68890887 <a title="443-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-22-Do_you_believe_in_induction%3F.html">104 hunch net-2005-08-22-Do you believe in induction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Foster Provost  gave a talk at the ICML  metalearning workshop  on “metalearning” and the “no free lunch theorem” which seems worth summarizing.
 
As a review: the no free lunch theorem is the most complicated way we know of to say that a  bias  is required in order to learn.  The simplest way to see this is in a nonprobabilistic setting.  If you are given examples of the form  (x,y)  and you wish to predict  y  from  x  then any prediction mechanism errs half the time in expectation over all sequences of examples.  The proof of this is very simple: on every example a predictor must make some prediction and by symmetry over the set of sequences it will be wrong half the time and right half the time.  The basic idea of this proof has been applied to many other settings.
 
The simplistic interpretation of this theorem which many people jump to is “machine learning is dead” since there can be no single learning algorithm which can solve all learning problems.  This is the wrong way to thi</p><p>6 0.62771922 <a title="443-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-02-Reviewing_techniques_for_conferences.html">65 hunch net-2005-05-02-Reviewing techniques for conferences</a></p>

</p><p>6 I tend to believe that we should be shifting to a journal format for ICML papers, as per many past discussions. [sent-42, score-0.268]

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>3 0.31573686 <a title="437-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>

it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is

theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm

are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to
fail:Give early w</p><p>4 0.81105441 <a title="437-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>6 0.77600503 <a title="437-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>2 0.97521061 <a title="437-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>3 0.96436751 <a title="437-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-27-Adversarial_Academia.html">333 hunch net-2008-12-27-Adversarial Academia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are
finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a
zero-sum game between different participants. This is not a viewpoint that I
want to promote, as I consider it flawed. However, I know several people
believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have substantial
explanatory power.For example:It explains why your paper was rejected based on
poor logic. The reviewer wasn't concerned with research quality, but rather
with rejecting a competitor.It explains why professors rarely work together.
The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case
for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours.It
explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted. Adopting a
competitor's program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor
being wrong.Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint
in different degrees</p><p>4 0.96085054 <a title="437-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>5 0.96023071 <a title="437-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-26-Parallel_Machine_Learning_Problems.html">229 hunch net-2007-01-26-Parallel Machine Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Parallel machine learning is a subject rarely addressed at machine learning
conferences. Nevertheless, it seems likely to increase in importance
because:Data set sizes appear to be growing substantially faster than
computation. Essentially, this happens because more and more sensors of
various sorts are being hooked up to the internet.Serial speedups of
processors seem are relatively stalled. The new trend is to make processors
more powerful by making themmulticore.BothAMDandIntelare making dual core
designs standard, with plans for more parallelism in the future.IBM'sCell
processorhas (essentially) 9 cores.Modern graphics chips can have an order of
magnitude more separate execution units.The meaning of 'core' varies a bit
from processor to processor, but the overall trend seems quite clear.So, how
do we parallelize machine learning algorithms?The simplest and most common
technique is to simply run the same learning algorithm with different
parameters on different processors. Cluster m</p><p>6 0.95867324 <a title="437-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-27-Not_goal_metrics.html">98 hunch net-2005-07-27-Not goal metrics</a></p>

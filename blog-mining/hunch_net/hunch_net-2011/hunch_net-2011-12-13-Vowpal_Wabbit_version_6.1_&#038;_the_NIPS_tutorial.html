<p>Introduction: Alekh ,  John ,  Ofer , and I are organizing a  workshop  at  NIPS  this year on learning in parallel and distributed environments.  The general interest level in parallel learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.  Please join us if you are parallel-interested.
 
And, if you are working in the area of parallel learning, please consider  submitting an abstract  due Oct. 17 for presentation at the workshop.</p><p>4 0.18618935 <a title="451-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-18-Parallel_ML_primitives.html">346 hunch net-2009-03-18-Parallel ML primitives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Previously, we discussed  parallel machine learning  a bit.  As parallel ML is rather difficult, I’d like to describe my thinking at the moment, and ask for advice from the rest of the world.  This is particularly relevant right now, as I’m attending a workshop tomorrow on parallel ML.
 
Parallelizing slow algorithms seems uncompelling.  Parallelizing many algorithms also seems uncompelling, because the effort required to parallelize is substantial.  This leaves the question: Which one fast algorithm is the best to parallelize?  What is a substantially different second?
 
One compellingly fast simple algorithm is online gradient descent on a linear representation.  This is the core of Leon’s  sgd  code and  Vowpal Wabbit .   Antoine Bordes  showed a variant was competitive in the  large scale learning challenge .  It’s also a decades old primitive which has been reused in many algorithms, and continues to be reused.  It also applies to online  learning  rather than just online  optimiz</p><p>5 0.16459532 <a title="451-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-15-Vowpal_Wabbit_6.0.html">441 hunch net-2011-08-15-Vowpal Wabbit 6.0</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just released  Vowpal Wabbit 6.0 .  Since the last version:
  
 VW is now 2-3 orders of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks to  Alekh .  Given the baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects.  The core improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters (either  Hadoop  or not).   This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with clusters of size 2 (and doesn’t hurt for clusters of size 1).  The core allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused—we’ve already used it to parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.  We’ll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now “README_cluster” and associated scripts should provide a good starting point.
 
 The new  LBFGS  code from  Miro  seems to commonly dominate the existing conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.

<p>Introduction: I’ve released  version 5.0  of the  Vowpal Wabbit  online learning software.  The major number has changed since the  last release  because I regard all earlier versions as obsolete—there are several new algorithms & features including substantial changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.  
 
The biggest changes are new algorithms:
  
  Nikos  and I improved the default algorithm.  The basic update rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully controlled so that it’s impossible to overrun the label.  In addition, the normalization has changed.  Computationally, these changes are virtually free and yield better results, sometimes much better.  Less careful updates can be reenabled with –loss_function classic, although results are still not identical to previous due to normalization changes. 
 Nikos also implemented the per-feature learning rates as per these  two   papers .  Often, this works better than the default algorithm.  It isn’t the defa</p><p>4 0.71525621 <a title="451-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-15-Vowpal_Wabbit_6.0.html">441 hunch net-2011-08-15-Vowpal Wabbit 6.0</a></p>

A big part of science fiction is imagining how things could be different, and then working through the implications.  
 
Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research.  (And, hey, it’s fun.)  Here’s some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning systems:
  
 Vernor Vinge, “True Names”, “A Fire Upon the Deep” 
 Marc Stiegler, “David’s Sling”, “Earthweb” 
 Charles Stross, “Singularity Sky” 
 Greg Egan, “Diaspora” 
 Joe Haldeman, “Forever Peace” 
  
(There are surely many others.)  
 
Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.  Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series).  That didn’t really happen in the last 50 years.

<p>Introduction: I just made  version 6.1  of  Vowpal Wabbit .  Relative to  6.0 , there are few new features, but many refinements. 
  
 The cluster parallel learning code better supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been mostly removed.  This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning core. 
 The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l 1  (via a truncated gradient variant) and l 2  regularization, and a generalized form of variable metric learning. 
 There is a solid persistent server mode which can train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in text or binary. 
  
This should be a very good release if you are just getting started, as we’ve made it compile more automatically out of the box, have several new  examples  and updated documentation.
 
As  per   tradition , we’re planning to do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at the  parallel learning workshop  at 2pm Spanish time Friday.

<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance.

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially touchy subject.  Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought about carefully.
 
There are a few things which should be understood:
  
 The system is changing and responsive.  We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC, and even we-the-NIPS-board.  NIPS has implemented ‘secondary program chairs’, ‘author response’, and ‘double blind reviewing’ in the last few years to help with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future. 
 Agreement creates a perception of correctness.  When any PC meets and makes a group decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness.  For the many people who have been on the NIPS PC it’s reasonable to entertain a healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty. 
 This post is about structural problems.  What problems arise because of the structure</p><p>5 0.61594993 <a title="451-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-26-Parallel_Machine_Learning_Problems.html">229 hunch net-2007-01-26-Parallel Machine Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Parallel machine learning is a subject rarely addressed at machine learning conferences.  Nevertheless, it seems likely to increase in importance because:
  
 Data set sizes appear to be growing substantially faster than computation.  Essentially, this happens because more and more sensors of various sorts are being hooked up to the internet. 
 Serial speedups of processors seem are relatively stalled.  The new trend is to make processors more powerful by making them  multicore .
 
 Both  AMD  and  Intel  are making dual core designs standard, with plans for more parallelism in the future. 
 IBM’s  Cell processor  has (essentially) 9 cores. 
 Modern graphics chips can have an order of magnitude more separate execution units. 
 

The meaning of ‘core’ varies a bit from processor to processor, but the overall trend seems quite clear.

 
  
So, how do we parallelize machine learning algorithms?

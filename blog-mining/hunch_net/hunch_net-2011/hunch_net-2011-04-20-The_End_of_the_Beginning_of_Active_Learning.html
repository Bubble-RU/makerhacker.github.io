<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,Sanjoymade a postsaying roughly "we should study
active learning theoretically, because not much is understood".At the time, we
did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-
learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the
noise rate. In other words, the fundamental question was "can we do it?"The
nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind. The answer is to
the previous question is "yes", both information theoretically and
computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.In
many situation, the question has now changed to: "is it worth it?" Is the
programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost
savings of active learning worthwhile? Currently, there are situations where
this question could go either way. Much of the challenge for the future is in
figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.At

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made sinceSanjoypointed out the
significantlack of theoretical understanding of active learning. This is an
update on the progress I know of. As a refresher, active learning as meant
here is:There is a source of unlabeled data.There is an oracle from which
labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.The goal is
to perform well with minimal use of the oracle.Here is what I've
learned:Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for
active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that
one of the classifiers is a correct classifier).Nina,Alina, and I developed an
algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data. A
draft ishere.Nicolo,Claudio, andLucashowed that it is possible to do active
learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold
classifiershere. This was published a year or two ago and I recently learned
about it.All of these results are relative</p><p>4 0.23988003 <a title="432-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-22-Active_learning.html">45 hunch net-2005-03-22-Active learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For
instance, if you're building a speech recognizer, it's easy enough to get raw
speech samples -- just walk around with a microphone -- but labeling even one
of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech
signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active
learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the
labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each
label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying,
you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a
regular supervised learning framework.Here's an example. Suppose the data lie
on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H =
{hw}:hw(x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.VC theory tells us that if the
underlying distribution P can be classified perfectly by some hypothesis in H

<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things atNIPS.The financial people were there in greater
force than previously.Two Sigmasponsored NIPS whileDRW Tradinghad a
booth.Theadversarial machine learning workshophad a number of talks about
interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up
your learning algorithm. This is very different from the situation we often
think of where the world is oblivious to our learning. This may present new
and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common
atCOLT.There were several interesing papers.Sanjoy Dasgupta,Daniel Hsu,
andClaire Monteleonihad a paper onGeneral Agnostic Active Learning. The basic
idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised
learning problem. This is great, because we have many supervised learning
algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.Joseph

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.In selective sampling style
active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label. We now
have an active learning algorithm that is:Efficientin label complexity,
unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity.Competitivewith supervised
learning anywhere that supervised learning works.Compatiblewith online
learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss
function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning
algorithms.Empiricallyeffective.The basic idea is to combinedisagreement
region-based samplingwithimportance weighting: an example is selected to be
labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing
among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted
by the inverse of these probabilities. The combination of these simple ideas
removes thesampling biasproblem that has plagued many previous heuristics for
active learning, and yet leads to</p><p>2 0.9956674 <a title="432-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you search for "online learning" with anymajorsearchengine, it's
interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.
This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering. In other
words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting
top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people
interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9
results. The essential observation here is that the process of human learning
is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.The internet
is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider
two possibilities:The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is,
with many teachers for the same subject.All the teachers for one subject get
together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in
online delivery. They spend a factor of 4 more time designing the perfect

<p>Introduction: This post is some combination of belaboring the obvious and speculating wildly
about the future. The basic issue to be addressed is how to think about
machine learning in terms given to us from Programming Language theory.Types
and ReductionsJohn's research programme (I feel this should be in British
spelling to reflect the grandiousness of the ideaâ&euro;Ś) of machine learning
reductionsStateOfReductionis at some essential level type-theoretic in nature.
The fundamental elements are the classifier, a function f: alpha -> beta, and
the corresponding classifier trainer g: List of (alpha,beta) -> (alpha ->
beta). The research goal is to create *combinators* that produce new f's and
g's given existing ones. John (probably quite rightly) seems unwilling at the
moment to commit to any notion stronger than these combinators are correctly
typed. One way to see the result of a reduction is something typed like: (For
those denied the joy of the Hindly-Milner type system, "simple" is probably

<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and
proving theorems about learning. Could he solve machine learning?The answer is
"no". This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.There are
several ways to conclude that somebiasis necessary in order to succesfully
learn. For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification. At
prediction time, we observe some featuresXand want to make a prediction of
either0or1. Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on
past experience. In order to learn we must:Have a bias. Always predicting0is
as likely as1is useless.Have the "right" bias. Predicting1when the answer
is0is also not helpful.The implication of "have a bias" is that we can not
design effective learning algorithms with "a uniform prior over all
possibilities". The implication of "have the 'right' bias" is that our
mathematician fails since "right" is defined with respect to the solutions to
problems encountered in the real</p><p>5 0.98716885 <a title="432-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>6 0.98688573 <a title="432-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-10-Interesting_papers%2C_ICML_2008.html">309 hunch net-2008-07-10-Interesting papers, ICML 2008</a></p>

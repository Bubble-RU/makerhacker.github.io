<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.

<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,  Sanjoy   made a post  saying roughly “we should  study active learning theoretically, because not much is understood”.   
 
At the time, we did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the noise rate.  In other words, the fundamental question was “can we do it?”
 
The nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind.   The answer is to the previous question is “yes”, both information theoretically and computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.  
 
In many situation, the question has now changed to: “is it worth it?”  Is the programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost savings of active learning worthwhile?  Currently, there are situations where this question could go either way.  Much of the challenge for the future is in figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.</p><p>3 0.27394575 <a title="432-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-02-Progress_in_Active_Learning.html">127 hunch net-2005-11-02-Progress in Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made since  Sanjoy  pointed out the significant  lack of theoretical understanding of active learning .  This is an update on the progress I know of.  As a refresher, active learning as meant here is:
  
 There is a source of unlabeled data. 
 There is an oracle from which labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source. 
 The goal is to perform well with minimal use of the oracle. 
  
Here is what I’ve learned:
  
 Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for active learning given the assumptions of IID data and “realizability” (that one of the classifiers is a correct classifier). 
  Nina ,  Alina , and I developed an algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data.  A draft is  here .

<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For instance, if you’re building a speech recognizer, it’s easy enough to get raw speech samples — just walk around with a microphone — but labeling even one of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying, you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a regular supervised learning framework.
 
Here’s an example. Suppose the data lie on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H = {h w }: 
  h w (x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.

<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things at  NIPS .
  
 The financial people were there in greater force than previously.   Two Sigma  sponsored NIPS while  DRW Trading  had a booth. 
 The  adversarial machine learning workshop  had a number of talks about interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up your learning algorithm.  This is very different from the situation we often think of where the world is oblivious to our learning.  This may present new and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common at  COLT . 
 There were several interesing papers.
 
  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Daniel Hsu , and  Claire Monteleoni  had a paper on  General Agnostic Active Learning .  The basic idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised learning problem.  This is great, because we have many supervised learning algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.

<p>Introduction: (I’m channeling for  Jean-Yves Audibert  here, with some minor tweaking for clarity.)
 
Since  Nemirovski’s   Saint Flour lecture notes , numerous researchers have studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well as 
  (MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice; model = finite set of d functions) 
  (C) the best convex combination of these functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions) 
  (L) the best linear combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d functions) 
It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov’s COLT’03 paper) that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n for (L), where n is the training set size.  Here, “risk” is amount of extra loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.
 
The practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9100731 <a title="432-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-20-The_End_of_the_Beginning_of_Active_Learning.html">432 hunch net-2011-04-20-The End of the Beginning of Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>3 0.89682245 <a title="432-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-21-Presentation_Preparation.html">249 hunch net-2007-06-21-Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference.  Since many people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial challenge.  Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about preparing a presentation on research.
  
  Motivate .  Talks which don’t start by describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out. 
  Prioritize .  It is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much.  This is an easy-to-understand failure mode as it’s very natural to want to include everything.  A basic fact is: you can’t.  Example of this are:
 
 Your slides are so densely full of equations and words that you can’t cover them. 
 Your talk runs over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off. 
 You motor-mouth through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.

<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most at  ICML  and  COLT  2010 were:
  
  Thomas Walsh ,  Kaushik Subramanian ,  Michael Littman  and  Carlos Diuk   Generalizing Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes .  This paper formalizes and provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that perform better than for either setting alone. 
  István Szita  and  Csaba Szepesvári   Model-based reinforcement learning with nearly tight exploration complexity bounds .  This paper and  another represent the frontier of best-known algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process. 
  James Martens   Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization .  About a new not-quite-online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional structures.  Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.

<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,  Sanjoy   made a post  saying roughly “we should  study active learning theoretically, because not much is understood”.   
 
At the time, we did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the noise rate.  In other words, the fundamental question was “can we do it?”
 
The nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind.   The answer is to the previous question is “yes”, both information theoretically and computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.  
 
In many situation, the question has now changed to: “is it worth it?”  Is the programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost savings of active learning worthwhile?  Currently, there are situations where this question could go either way.  Much of the challenge for the future is in figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.81588018 <a title="432-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>

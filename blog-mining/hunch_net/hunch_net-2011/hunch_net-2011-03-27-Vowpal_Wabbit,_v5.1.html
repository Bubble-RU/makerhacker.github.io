<p>Introduction: Martin Pooland I recently discussed the similarities and differences between
academia and open source programming.Similarities:Cost profileResearch and
programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort
is required to produce something useful, and then "anyone" can use it. (The
"anyone" is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently
technical people could use it.)Wealth profileA "wealthy" academic or open
source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in
research or programs. Much of academia is a "gift culture": whoever gives the
most is most respected.ProblemsBoth academia and open source programming
suffer from similar problems.Whether or not (and which) open source program is
used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability
or usefulness. Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to
directions of research.Funding is often a problem for both groups. Academics

<p>Introduction: We are releasing theVowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) codeas open source
under a BSD (revised) license. This is aproject at Yahoo! Researchto build a
useful large scale learning algorithm whichLihong Li,Alex Strehl, and I have
been working on.To appreciate the meaning of "large", it's useful to define
"small" and "medium". A "small" supervised learning problem is one where a
human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor. A
"medium" supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern
desktop computer. A "large" supervised learning problem is one which does not
fit into the RAM of a normal machine. VW tackles large scale learning problems
by this definition of large. I'm not aware of any other open source Machine
Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist). A few
close ones are:IBM's Parallel Machine Learning Toolboxisn't quite open source.
The approach used by this toolbox is essentially map-reduce style computation,</p><p>4 0.11526808 <a title="428-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-09-29-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_7.0.html">473 hunch net-2012-09-29-Vowpal Wabbit, version 7.0</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A new version ofVWisout. The primary changes are:Learning Reductions: I've
wanted to getlearning reductionsworking and we've finally done it. Not
everything is implemented yet, but VW now supports direct:Multiclass
Classification-oaaor-ect.Cost Sensitive Multiclass Classification-csoaaor-
wap.Contextual Bandit Classification-cb.Sequential Structured Prediction-
searnor-daggerIn addition, it is now easy to build your own custom learning
reductions for various plausible uses: feature diddling, custom structured
prediction problems, or alternate learning reductions. This effort is far from
done, but it is now in a generally useful state. Note that all learning
reductions inherit the ability to do cluster parallel learning.Library
interface: VW now has a basic library interface. The library provides most of
the functionality of VW, with the limitation that it is monolithic and
nonreentrant. These will be improved over time.Windows port: The priority of a
windows port jumped way up once we</p><p>5 0.10728631 <a title="428-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At thelast ICML,Tom Dietterichasked me to look into systems for commenting on
papers. I've been slow getting to this, but it's relevant now.The essential
observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they
are not yet much used in academic research. If we can find the right way to
use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the
first conference that manages to really create an online community. Various
conferences have been poking at this. For example,UAI has setup a wiki, COLT
hasstarted usingJoomla, with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting
up a "student blog". Similarly,Dinoj Surendransetup a twiki for theChicago
Machine Learning Summer School, which was quite useful for coordinating events
and other things.I believe the most important thing is a willingness to
experiment. A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference
websites. For example, theICML 2007 papers pageis basically only useful via
grep. A mu</p><p>6 0.10613132 <a title="428-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-02-The_Machine_Learning_Award_goes_to_%26%238230%3B.html">270 hunch net-2007-11-02-The Machine Learning Award goes to &#8230;</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm releasingversion 4.0(tarball) ofVowpal Wabbit. The biggest change (by far)
in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable
help fromDaniel Hsu.I also took advantage of the major version number to
introduce some incompatible changes, including switching tomurmurhash 2, and
other alterations to cachefiles. You'll need to delete and regenerate them. In
addition, the precise specification for a "tag" (i.e. string that can be used
to identify an example) changed--you can't have a space between the tag and
the '|' at the beginning of the feature namespace.And, of course, we made it
faster.For the future, I put up mytodo listoutlining the major future
improvements I want to see in the code. I'm planning to discuss the current
mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at thelarge scale
machine learning workshopatNIPSlater this week. Several people have asked me
to do a tutorial/walkthrough of VW, which is arranged for friday 2pm in the

<p>Introduction: I realized that the tools needed to solve theproblem just postedwere just
created. I tried to sketch out the solutionhere(also in.lyxand.tex). It is
still quite sketchy (and probably only the few people who understand
reductions well can follow).One of the reasons why I started this weblog was
to experiment with "research in the open", and this is an opportunity to do
so. Over the next few days, I'll be filling in details and trying to get
things to make sense. If you have additions or ideas, please propose them.</p><p>5 0.55151075 <a title="428-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-15-Vowpal_Wabbit_6.0.html">441 hunch net-2011-08-15-Vowpal Wabbit 6.0</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just releasedVowpal Wabbit 6.0. Since the last version:VW is now 2-3 orders
of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks toAlekh. Given the
baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature
datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects. The core
improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters
(eitherHadoopor not). This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with
clusters of size 2 (and doesn't hurt for clusters of size 1). The core
allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused--we've already used it to
parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.
We'll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now
"README_cluster" and associated scripts should provide a good starting
point.The newLBFGScode fromMiroseems to commonly dominate the existing
conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.The new matrix factorization

<p>Introduction: We'd like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop
on kernel learning. While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels
from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature
selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no
restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression,
classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be
considered. The deadline for submissions isOctober 24.More detail can be
foundhere.Corinna Cortes, Arthur Gretton, Gert Lanckriet, Mehryar Mohri,

<p>Introduction: I just createdversion 5.1ofvowpal wabbit. This almost entirely a bugfix
release, so it's an easy upgrade from v5.0.In addition:There is now amailing
list, which I and several other developers are subscribed to.The main website
has shifted to the wiki on github. This means that anyone with a github
account can now edit it.I'm planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it
ateHarmony/the LA machine learning meetupat 10am. Drop by if you're
interested.The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.
When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in
terms of features. At this point, many other projects have started to
appreciate the value of the design choices here. This includes:Mahout, which
now has an SGD implementation.Shogun, whereSoerenis keen onincorporating
features.LibLinear, where they won the KDD best paper award forout-of-core
learning.This is expected--any open source approach which works well should be
widely adopted. None of these othe</p><p>3 0.90105665 <a title="428-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I second thecall for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI.Severaltimesbefore, details of
why and how to run a workshop have been mentioned.There is a simple reason to
prefer workshops here: attendance. The Helsinki colocation has placed
workshopsdirectly between ICML and COLT/UAI, which is optimal for getting
attendees from any conference. In addition,last year ICML had relatively few
workshopsand NIPS workshops were overloaded. In addition tothose that
happeneda similar number were rejected. The overload has strange consequences
--for example,the best attended workshopwasn't an official NIPS workshop.
Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly
from being off schedule.</p><p>4 0.76811767 <a title="428-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-30-Concerns_about_the_Large_Scale_Learning_Challenge.html">300 hunch net-2008-04-30-Concerns about the Large Scale Learning Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale learning challengefor ICML interests me a great deal, although
I have concerns about the way it is structured.From theinstructions page,
several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly
find a good solution.mediumA dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.largeA large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.By this definition, all of the datasets are medium
sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning
algorithms that don't require random access to examples.No Loading TimeThe

<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data
to make predictions. However, people disagree to some extent about what this
means. One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one
extreme is "tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction" and the other
extreme is "tools to do prediction with no human intervention". Here is my
estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this
spectrum.Human NecessaryHuman partially necessaryHuman unnecessaryClustering,
data visualizationBayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical
ModelsKernel Learning (SVM's, etc..)Decision Trees?Reinforcement LearningThe
exact position of each element is of course debatable. My reasoning is that
clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a
human in the loop. Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally
require a human to sit and think about what is a good prior/structure. Kernel

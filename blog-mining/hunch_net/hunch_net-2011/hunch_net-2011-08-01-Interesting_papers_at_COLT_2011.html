<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious. There
are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.Error
limiting reductions. Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created
classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you
reduce to. A very simple example of this is thaterror correcting output
codeswhere it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass
error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate.Regret minimizing
reductions. Here, the goal is to bound theregretof the created classifier in
terms of theregretof the binary classifiers reduced to. The regret is the
error rate minus the minimum error rate. When the learning problem is noisy
the minimum error rate may not be0. An analagous result for reget is that for
aprobabilistic error correcting output code, multiclass regret is at most 4 *
(binary regret)0.5.The use of "regret" is more desirable than the use of error
rates, becaus</p><p>4 0.15740916 <a title="439-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-01-The_Role_of_Impromptu_Talks.html">88 hunch net-2005-07-01-The Role of Impromptu Talks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLThad an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting
than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).
There are several roles that an impromptu session can play
including:Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen
now rather than later helps aid the process of research.Discussing a paper
that was rejected. Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a
means to remedy that.Entertainment. We all like to have a bit of fun.For
design, the following seem important:Impromptu speakers should not have much
time. At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well.The entire
impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and
promotes restlessness. A half hour or hour can work well.Impromptu talks are a
mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule. They will be chaotic
in content, presentation, and usefulness. The fundamental advantage of this
chaos is that it provid</p><p>5 0.13998517 <a title="439-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-08-Conditional_Tournaments_for_Multiclass_to_Binary.html">243 hunch net-2007-05-08-Conditional Tournaments for Multiclass to Binary</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thisproblemhas been cracked (but not quite completely solved) byAlina,Pradeep,
andI. The problem is essentially finding a better way to reduce multiclass
classification to binary classification. The solution is to use a carefully
crafted tournament, the simplest version of which is asingle elimination
tournamentwhere the "players" are the different classes. An example of the
structure is here:For the single elimination tournament, we can prove that:For
all multiclass problemsD, for all learned binary classifiersc, the regret of
an induced multiclass classifier is bounded by the regret of the binary
classifier timeslog2k. Restated:regmulticlass(D,Filter_tree_test(c)) <=

binary classification problemFilter_tree_test(c)is the induced multiclass

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko
AllocationWei Li, Andrew McCallumA very elegant (but computationally
challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level
DAG whose interior nodesare "super-topics" and "sub-topics" and whose leaves
are thevocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning
stir.Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another

<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson's paper, there were (at least) two other papers that
caught my eye at UAI.One wasthis paperby Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul
Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost
all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with
finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look
like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you'd expect from
Sanjoy.The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven't
groked yet isthis beastby Manfred and Dima Kuzmin.You can check out the
(beautiful)slidesif that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but
my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides
are also on Manfred's page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>6 0.53729683 <a title="439-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-01-The_Role_of_Impromptu_Talks.html">88 hunch net-2005-07-01-The Role of Impromptu Talks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SinceJohndid not attendCOLTthis year, I have been volunteered to report back
on the hot stuff at this year's meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty
high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all
the three days. I'm gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program
in a chronological order.The first session on matrices seemed interesting for
two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this
is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing
literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally
make their entry at COLT. The paper ofOhadandShaionCollaborative Filtering
with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducingprovides non-trivial
guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina
andNatishow how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for
matrix completion problems in their paperConcentration-Based Guarantees for

<p>Introduction: TheInternational Planning Competition(IPC) is a biennial event organized in
the context of theInternational Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling(ICAPS). This year, for the first time, there will a learning track
of the competition. For more information you can go to the competitionweb-
site.The competitions are typically organized around a number of planning
domains that can vary from year to year, where a planning domain is simply a
class of problems that share a common action schema--e.g. Blocksworld is a
well-known planning domain that contains a problem instance each possible
initial tower configuration and goal configuration. Some other domains have
included Logistics, Airport, Freecell, PipesWorld, and manyothers. For each
domain the competition includes a number of problems (say 40-50) and the
planners are run on each problem with a time limit for each problem (around 30
minutes). The problems are hard enough that many problems are not solved
within the time limit.Giv</p><p>3 0.7376945 <a title="439-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-06-Data_Linkage_Problems.html">217 hunch net-2006-11-06-Data Linkage Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data linkage is a problem which seems to come up in various applied machine
learning problems. I have heard it mentioned in various data mining contexts,
but it seems relatively less studied for systemic reasons.A very simple
version of the data linkage problem is a cross hospital patient record merge.
Suppose a patient (John Doe) is admitted to a hospital (General Health),
treated, and released. Later, John Doe is admitted to a second hospital
(Health General), treated, and released. Given a large number of records of
this sort, it becomes very tempting to try and predict the outcomes of
treatments. This is reasonably straightforward as a machine learning problem
if there is a shared unique identifier for John Doe used by General Health and
Health General along with time stamps. We can merge the records and create
examples of the form "Given symptoms and treatment, did the patient come back
to a hospital within the next year?" These examples could be fed into a
learning algorithm, and</p><p>4 0.73592716 <a title="439-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-08-MaxEnt_contradicts_Bayes_Rule%3F.html">191 hunch net-2006-07-08-MaxEnt contradicts Bayes Rule?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I readthis. David Blei and I spent some time thinking hard
about this a few years back (thanks to Kary Myers for pointing us to it):In
short I was thinking that Ã¢â‚¬Å“bayesian belief updatingÃ¢â‚¬Â and
Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum entropyÃ¢â‚¬Â were two othogonal principles. But it appear
that they are not, and that they can even be in conflict !Example (from Kass
1996); consider a Die (6 sides), consider prior knowledge E[X]=3.5.Maximum
entropy leads to P(X)= (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6).Now consider a new piece
of evidence A=Ã¢â‚¬ÂX is an odd numberÃ¢â‚¬ÂBayesian posterior P(X|A)=
P(A|X) P(X) = (1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0).But MaxEnt with the constraints
E[X]=3.5 and E[Indicator function of A]=1 leads to (.22, 0, .32, 0, .47, 0) !!
(note that E[Indicator function of A]=P(A))Indeed, for MaxEnt, because there
is no more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6Ã¢â‚¬Â², big numbers must be more probable to ensure an
average of 3.5. For bayesian updating, P(X|A) doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have a
3.5 expectation. P(X) a</p><p>5 0.67061841 <a title="439-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-24-Top_graduates_this_season.html">384 hunch net-2009-12-24-Top graduates this season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I would like to point out 3 graduates this season as having my confidence they
are capable of doing great things.Daniel Hsuhas diverse papers with diverse
coauthors on {active learning, mulitlabeling, temporal learning, â&euro;Ś} each
covering new algorithms and methods of analysis. He is also a capable
programmer, having helped me with some nitty-gritty details of cluster
parallelVowpal Wabbitthis summer. He has an excellent tendency to just get
things done.Nicolas Lambertdoesn't nominally work in machine learning, but
I've found his work inelicitationrelevant nevertheless. In essence, elicitable
properties are closely related to learnable properties, and the elicitation
complexity is related to a notion of learning complexity. See theSurrogate
regret bounds paperfor some related discussion. Few people successfully work
at such a general level that it crosses fields, but he's one of them.Yisong
Yueis deeply focused on interactive learning, which he has attacked at all
levels: theory, algorit</p><p>6 0.56168085 <a title="439-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

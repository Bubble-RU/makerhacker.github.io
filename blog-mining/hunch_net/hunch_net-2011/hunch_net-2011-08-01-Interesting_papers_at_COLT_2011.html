<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious.  There are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.
  
 Error limiting reductions.  Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you reduce to.  A very simple example of this is that  error correcting output codes  where it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate. 
 Regret minimizing reductions.  Here, the goal is to bound the  regret  of the created classifier in terms of the  regret  of the binary classifiers reduced to.  The regret is the error rate minus the minimum error rate.  When the learning problem is noisy the minimum error rate may not be  0 .  An analagous result for reget is that for a  probabilistic error correcting output code , multiclass regret is at most 4 * (binary regret) 0.5 .

<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>5 0.15399297 <a title="439-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-08-Conditional_Tournaments_for_Multiclass_to_Binary.html">243 hunch net-2007-05-08-Conditional Tournaments for Multiclass to Binary</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  problem  has been cracked (but not quite completely solved) by  Alina ,  Pradeep , and  I .  The problem is essentially finding a better way to reduce multiclass classification to binary classification.  The solution is to use a carefully crafted tournament,  the simplest version of which is a  single elimination tournament  where the “players” are the different classes.  An example of the structure is here: 
    
For the single elimination tournament, we can prove that: 
 For all multiclass problems  D , for all learned binary classifiers  c , the regret of an induced multiclass classifier is bounded by the regret of the binary classifier times  log 2  k .  Restated:  
  reg multiclass (D,Filter_tree_test(c)) <= reg binary  (Filter_tree_train(D),c)    
Here:
  
   Filter_tree_train(D)  is the induced binary classification problem 
   Filter_tree_test(c)  is the induced multiclass classifier.

<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page.

<p>Introduction: Since  John  did not attend  COLT  this year, I have been volunteered to report back on the hot stuff at this year’s meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all the three days. I’m gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program in a chronological order.
 
The first session on matrices seemed interesting for two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally make their entry at COLT. The paper of  Ohad  and  Shai  on  Collaborative Filtering with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducing  provides non-trivial guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina and  Nati  show how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for matrix completion problems in their paper  Concentr</p><p>2 0.81897771 <a title="439-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I second the  call for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI .
 
 Several   times   before , details of why and how to run a  workshop have been mentioned.  
 
There is a simple reason to prefer workshops here: attendance.  The Helsinki colocation has placed workshops  directly between ICML and COLT/UAI , which is optimal for getting attendees from any conference.  In addition,  last year ICML had relatively few workshops  and NIPS workshops were overloaded.  In addition to  those that happened  a similar number were rejected.  The overload has strange consequences—for example,  the best attended workshop  wasn’t an official NIPS workshop.  Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly from being off schedule.</p><p>3 0.66481662 <a title="439-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-02-Contextual_Scaling.html">237 hunch net-2007-04-02-Contextual Scaling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning has a new kind of “scaling to larger problems” to worry about: scaling with the amount of contextual information.  The standard development path for a machine learning application in practice seems to be the following:
  
  Marginal . In the beginning, there was “majority vote”.  At this stage, it isn’t necessary to understand that you have a prediction problem.  People just realize that one answer is right sometimes and another answer other times.  In machine learning terms, this corresponds to making a prediction without side information. 
  First context . A clever person realizes that some bit of information  x 1   could be helpful.  If  x 1   is discrete, they condition on it and make a predictor  h(x 1 ) , typically by counting.  If they are clever, then they also do some smoothing.  If  x 1   is some real valued parameter, it’s very common to make a threshold cutoff.  Often, these tasks are simply done by hand. 
  Second . Another clever person (or perhaps the s</p><p>4 0.55568475 <a title="439-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>5 0.5530535 <a title="439-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-16-The_Forgetting.html">233 hunch net-2007-02-16-The Forgetting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many papers do you remember from 2006? 2005? 2002? 1997? 1987? 1967?  One way to judge this would be to look at the citations of the papers you write—how many came from which year?  For myself, the answers on recent papers are:
  
 
 year 
 2006 
 2005 
 2002 
 1997 
 1987 
 1967 
 
 
 count 
 4 
 10 
 5 
 1 
 0 
 0 
 
  
This spectrum is fairly typical of papers in general.  There are many reasons that citations are focused on recent papers.
  
 The number of papers being published continues to grow.  This is not a very significant effect, because the rate of publication has not grown nearly as fast. 
 Dead men don’t reject your papers for not citing them.  This reason seems lame, because it’s a distortion from the ideal of science.  Nevertheless, it must be stated because the effect can be significant. 
 In 1997, I started as a PhD student.  Naturally, papers after 1997 are better remembered because they were absorbed in real time.

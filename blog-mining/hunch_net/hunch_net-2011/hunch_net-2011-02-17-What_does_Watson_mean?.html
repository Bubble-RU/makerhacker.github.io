<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that

create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>3 0.14597203 <a title="424-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar

<p>Introduction: If you search for "online learning" with anymajorsearchengine, it's
interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.
This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering. In other
words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting
top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people
interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9
results. The essential observation here is that the process of human learning
is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.The internet
is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider
two possibilities:The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is,
with many teachers for the same subject.All the teachers for one subject get
together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in
online delivery. They spend a factor of 4 more time designing the perfect

<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

<p>Introduction: In the AI-related parts of machine learning, it is often tempting to examine
howyoudo things in order to imagine how a machine should do things. This is
introspection, and it can easily go awry. I will call introspection gone awry
introspectionism.Introspectionism is almost unique to AI (and the AI-related
parts of machine learning) and it can lead to huge wasted effort in research.
It's easiest to show how introspectionism arises by an example.Suppose we want
to solve the problem of navigating a robot from point A to point B given a
camera. Then, the following research action plan might seem natural when you
examine your own capabilities:Build an edge detector for still images.Build an
object recognition system given the edge detector.Build a system to predict
distance and orientation to objects given the object recognition system.Build
a system to plan a path through the scene you construct from {object
identification, distance, orientation} predictions.As you execute the above,

<p>Introduction: There are very substantial differences in how question asking is viewed
culturally. For example, all of the following are common:If no one asks a
question, then no one is paying attention.To ask a question is disrespectful
of the speaker.Asking a question is admitting your own ignorance.The first
view seems to be the right one for research, for several reasons.Research is
quite hard--it's difficult to guess how people won't understand something in
advance while preparing a presentation. Consequently, it's very common to lose
people. No worthwhile presenter wants that.Real understanding is precious. By
asking a question, you are really declaring "I want to understand", and
everyone should respect that.Asking a question wakes you up. I don't mean from
"asleep" to "awake" but from "awake" to "really awake". It's easy to drift
through something sort-of-understanding. When you ask a question, especially
because you are on the spot, you will do much better.Some of these effects

<p>Introduction: Watsonconvincingly beat the best championJeopardy!players. The apparent
significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge
about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology. For a random
person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for
people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good
assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire
system work.Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed
to put together and execute this project--many years of effort by a diverse
set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen. In academia,
it's pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent,
and in industry it's rarely the case that such a capable group has both a
worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for
several years before success.Alinainvited me to the Jeopardy watching party

<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>3 0.83903307 <a title="424-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>4 0.83329219 <a title="424-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This
isn't for lack of trying--there are many models of exploration which have been
analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some
point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these
many models.Reinforcement Learning(1). Reinforcement learning has
traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next states'is
given by a conditional distributionP(s'|s,a)given the current statesand
actiona. The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms
controlling an agent can behave withineof optimal for horizonTexcept

<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

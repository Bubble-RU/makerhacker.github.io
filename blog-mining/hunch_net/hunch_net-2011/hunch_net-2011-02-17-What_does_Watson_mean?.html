</p><p>4 Partly, this is because I already knew that computers could answer trivia questions moderately well(*), so the question was just how far this could be improved. [sent-10, score-0.238]
</p><p>5 Gerry tells me that although Watson’s error rate is still significant, one key element is the ability to estimate with high accuracy when they can answer with high accuracy. [sent-11, score-0.372]
</p><p>6 The first is that there is clearly very substantial room for improvement, and the second is that having a natural language question/answering device that can quickly search and respond from large sets of text is obviously valuable. [sent-15, score-0.202]

</p><p>9 Fully conversational speech recognition working in an open domain should take somewhat longer, because speech recognition software has additional error points, conversational systems aren’t so easy to come by, and in a fully open domain the error rates will be higher.

<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with both  Vikash Mansinghka  and  Thomas Breuel  about approaching AI with machine learning.  The general interest in taking a crack at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts including  DARPA .
 
As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in AI which died down before I began research.  There remain many projects and conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet.  Here are a few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:
  
  Supply/Product confusion .  Sometimes we think “Intelligences use X, so I’ll create X and have an Intelligence.”  An example of this is the  Cyc Project  which inspires some people as “intelligences use ontologies, so I’ll create an ontology and a system using it to have an Intelligence.”  The flaw here is that Intelligences  create  ontologies, which they use, and without the ability to create ont</p><p>3 0.14219536 <a title="424-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Search” is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful.   Concrete examples include  Deep Blue  which beat the world chess champion and  Chinook  the champion checkers program.  A set of core search techniques exist including A * , alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different search problems.
 
Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search.  Given also that  humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again.  However, the big successful search-based systems have typically not used “smart” search algorithms.  Insteady they have optimized for very fast search.  This is not for lack of trying… many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to various degrees of success.   For example,  Knightcap  achieves good-but-not-stellar chess playing performance, and  TD-gammon</p><p>4 0.14144756 <a title="424-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-The_Humanloop_Spectrum_of_Machine_Learning.html">3 hunch net-2005-01-24-The Humanloop Spectrum of Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data to make predictions.  However, people disagree to some extent about what this means.  One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is “tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction” and the other extreme is “tools to do prediction with no human intervention”.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.
  
 
 Human Necessary 
  
 Human partially necessary 
  
 Human unnecessary 
 
 
 Clustering, data visualization 
 Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical Models 
 Kernel Learning (SVM’s, etc..) 
 Decision Trees? 
 Reinforcement Learning 
 
  
The exact position of each element is of course debatable.  My reasoning is that clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a human in the loop.  Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally require a human to sit and think about what</p><p>5 0.11187029 <a title="424-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you search for “online learning” with any  major   search   engine , it’s interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.  This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering.  In other words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9 results.  The essential observation here is that the process of human learning is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.  
 
The internet is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider two possibilities:
  
 The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is, with many teachers for the same subject. 
 All the teachers for one subject get together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in online delivery.

<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>5 0.62429428 <a title="424-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism_as_a_Disease.html">153 hunch net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism as a Disease</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the AI-related parts of machine learning, it is often tempting to examine how  you  do things in order to imagine how a machine should do things.  This is introspection, and it can easily go awry.  I will call introspection gone awry introspectionism.
 
Introspectionism is almost unique to AI (and the AI-related parts of machine learning) and it can lead to huge wasted effort in research.  It’s easiest to show how introspectionism arises by an example.
 
Suppose we want to solve the problem of navigating a robot from point A to point B given a camera.  Then, the following research action plan might seem natural when you examine your own capabilities:
  
 Build an edge detector for still images. 
 Build an object recognition system given the edge detector. 
 Build a system to predict distance and orientation to objects given the object recognition system. 
 Build a system to plan a path through the scene you construct from {object identification, distance, orientation} predictions.</p><p>6 0.6199469 <a title="424-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-28-Sufficient_Computation.html">287 hunch net-2008-01-28-Sufficient Computation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Watson  convincingly beat the best champion  Jeopardy!  players.  The apparent significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology.  For a random person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire system work.
 
Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed to put together and execute this project—many years of effort by a diverse set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen.  In academia, it’s pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent, and in industry it’s rarely the case that such a capable group has both a worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for several years before success.

<p>Introduction: This post is about a confusion of mine with respect to many commonly used machine learning algorithms.   
 
A simple example where this comes up is Bayes net prediction.  A Bayes net where a directed acyclic graph over a set of nodes where each node is associated with a variable and the edges indicate dependence.  The joint probability distribution over the variables is given by a set of conditional probabilities.  For example, a very simple Bayes net might express: 
 P(A,B,C) = P(A | B,C)P(B)P(C) 
 
What I don’t understand is the mechanism commonly used to estimate  P(A | B, C) .  If we let  N(A,B,C)  be the number of instances of  A,B,C  then people sometimes form an estimate according to: 
  P’(A | B,C) = N(A,B,C) / N /[N(B)/N * N(C)/N] = N(A,B,C) N /[N(B)  N(C)]   
… in other words, people just estimate  P’(A | B,C)  according to observed relative frequencies.  This is a reasonable technique when you have a large number of samples compared to the size space  A x B x C , but it (nat</p><p>3 0.83784634 <a title="424-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-25-Upcoming_conference.html">198 hunch net-2006-07-25-Upcoming conference</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>5 0.78489578 <a title="424-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-27-The_Peekaboom_Dataset.html">159 hunch net-2006-02-27-The Peekaboom Dataset</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn â&euro;&tilde;s  Peekaboom project  has yielded  data  (830MB).
 
Peekaboom is the second attempt (after  Espgame ) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to solve vision problems based on voluntary game play.  As a second attempt, it is meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt.  In particular:
  
 The locations of specific objects are provided by the data. 
 The data collection is far more complete and extensive. 
  
The data consists of:
  
 The source images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.) 
 The in-game events. (1 file per image, in a lispy syntax.) 
 A description of the event language. 
  
There is a great deal of very specific and relevant data here so the hope that this will help solve vision problems seems quite reasonable.</p><p>6 0.77484745 <a title="424-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

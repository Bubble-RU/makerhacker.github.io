<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost
exclusively about new research, rather than evaluation (and consideration) of
research directions. This last role is satisfied by funding agencies to some
extent, but that is a private debate of</p><p>3 0.0 <a title="434-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-Holy_grails_of_machine_learning%3F.html">2 hunch net-2005-01-24-Holy grails of machine learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me kick things off by posing this question to ML researchers:What do you
think are some important holy grails of machine learning?For example:- "A
classifier with SVM-level performance but much more scalable"- "Practical
confidence bounds (or learning bounds) for classification"- "A reinforcement
learning algorithm that can handle the ___ problem"- "Understanding
theoretically why ___ works so well in practice"etc.I pose this question
because I believe that when goals are stated explicitly and well (thus
providing clarity as well as opening up the problems to more people), rather
than left implicit, they are likely to be achieved much more quickly. I would
also like to know more about the internal goals of the various machine
learning sub-areas (theory, kernel methods, graphical models, reinforcement
learning, etc) as stated by people in these respective areas. This could help
people cross sub-areas.</p><p>4 0.0 <a title="434-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-The_Humanloop_Spectrum_of_Machine_Learning.html">3 hunch net-2005-01-24-The Humanloop Spectrum of Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data
to make predictions. However, people disagree to some extent about what this
means. One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one
extreme is "tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction" and the other
extreme is "tools to do prediction with no human intervention". Here is my
estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this
spectrum.Human NecessaryHuman partially necessaryHuman unnecessaryClustering,
data visualizationBayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical
ModelsKernel Learning (SVM's, etc..)Decision Trees?Reinforcement LearningThe
exact position of each element is of course debatable. My reasoning is that
clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a
human in the loop. Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally
require a human to sit and think about what is a good prior/structure. Kernel

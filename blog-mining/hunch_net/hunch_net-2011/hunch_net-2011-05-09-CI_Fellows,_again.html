<p>Introduction: One part of doing research is debugging your understanding of reality.  This is hard work: How do you even discover where you misunderstand?  If you discover a misunderstanding, how do you go about removing it?
 
The process of debugging computer programs is quite analogous to debugging reality misunderstandings.   This is natural—a bug in a computer program is a misunderstanding between you and the computer about what you said.  Many of the familiar techniques from debugging have exact parallels.
  
  Details  When programming, there are often signs that some bug exists like: “the graph my program output is shifted a little bit” = maybe you have an indexing error.  In debugging yourself, we often have some impression that something is “not right”. These impressions should be addressed directly and immediately.  (Some people have the habit of suppressing worries in favor of excess certainty.  That’s not healthy for research.)

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87847859 <a title="434-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-05-09-CI_Fellows%2C_again.html">434 hunch net-2011-05-09-CI Fellows, again</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML). 
 Reviewer erroneously</p><p>4 0.77450371 <a title="434-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be complete.) 
More generally, this is a good time to ask for suggestions.  What would make this blog more useful?</p><p>5 0.70336896 <a title="434-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>6 0.69100654 <a title="434-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net.html">240 hunch net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net</a></p>

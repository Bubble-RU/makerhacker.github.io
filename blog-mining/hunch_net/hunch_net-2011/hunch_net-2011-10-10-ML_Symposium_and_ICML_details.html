<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for future conference organizers.
 
 Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)  
We chose to use  CMT  over other conference management software mainly because of its rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.), good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).  Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at that interface sometime soon!
 
 Toronto Matching System (TMS)  
  TMS  is now being used by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an automated system (developed by  Laurent Charlin  and  Rich Ze</p><p>3 0.16608028 <a title="447-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a quick reference for summer ML-related conferences sorted by due date:
  
 
 Conference 
 Due date 
 Location

  KDD  
 Feb 10 
 August 12-16, Beijing, China 
 Single Blind 
 
 
  COLT

 Double Blind, author response, zero  SPOF  
 
 
  UAI  
 March 30 
 August 15-17, Catalina Islands, California 
 Double Blind, author response 
 
  
Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>4 0.16466726 <a title="447-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.  For the future, getting a colocation with  ACL  or  SIGI</p><p>5 0.15643609 <a title="447-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  Attendance was 268, significantly larger than  last year .  My impression was that the event mostly still fit the space, although it was crowded.  If anyone has suggestions for next year, speak up.
 
The best student paper award went to  Sergiu Goschin  for a cool video of how his system learned to play video games (I can’t find the paper online yet).  Choosing amongst the submitted talks was pretty difficult this year, as there were many similarly good ones.
 
By coincidence all the invited talks were (at least potentially) about faster learning algorithms.   Stephen Boyd  talked about  ADMM .  Leon Bottou  spoke on single pass online learning via  averaged SGD .   Yoav Freund  talked about  parameter-free hedging .  In Yoav’s case the talk was mostly about a better theoretical learning algorithm, but it has the potential to unlock an exponential computational complexity improvement via oraclization of experts algorithms… but some serious</p><p>6 0.15155789 <a title="447-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There will be no New York ML Symposium this year.

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>5 0.61867917 <a title="447-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-28-NY_ML_Symposium_2010.html">415 hunch net-2010-10-28-NY ML Symposium 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>6 0.61621457 <a title="447-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-18-7th_Annual_Machine_Learning_Symposium.html">474 hunch net-2012-10-18-7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ed Snelson  won the  Predictive Uncertainty in Environmental Modelling Competition  in the temp(erature) category using  this algorithm .  Some characteristics of the algorithm are:
  
 Gradient descent 
 … on about 600 parameters 
 … with local minima 
 … to solve regression. 
  
This bears a strong resemblance to a neural network.  The two main differences seem to be:
  
 The system has a probabilistic interpretation (which may aid design). 
 There are (perhaps) fewer parameters than a typical neural network might have for the same problem (aiding speed).</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88137347 <a title="447-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-10-ML_Symposium_and_ICML_details.html">447 hunch net-2011-10-10-ML Symposium and ICML details</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone should have received notice for  NY ML Symposium  abstracts.  Check carefully, as one was lost by our system.  
 
The event itself is October 21, next week.   Leon Bottou ,  Stephen Boyd , and  Yoav Freund  are giving the invited talks this year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the day.   Chris Wiggins  has setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment interested.
 
I also wanted to give an update on  ICML 2012 .  Unlike last year, our deadline is coordinated with  AIStat  (which is due this Friday).  The paper deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break.  Other details may interest people as well: 
  
 We settled on using  CMT  after checking out the possibilities.  I wasn’t looking for this, because I’ve  often found CMT clunky in terms of easy access to the right information.

<p>Introduction: For the  Chicago 2005 machine learning summer school  we are organizing, at least 5 international students can not come due to visa issues.  There seem to be two aspects to visa issues:
  
  Inefficiency . The system rejected the student simply by being incapable of even  starting  to evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of time. 
  Politics . Border controls became much tighter after the September 11 attack.  Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will do that. 
  
What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem than (2).  Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa rejection.  Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry even people concerned with (2).  The obvious fixes to overload are “spend more money” and “make the system more efficient”.
 
With respect to (2), (which is a more minor issue by the numbers) it i</p><p>4 0.76603794 <a title="447-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-22-New_Blog%3A_%5BLowerbounds%2CUpperbounds%5D.html">59 hunch net-2005-04-22-New Blog: [Lowerbounds,Upperbounds]</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pat (the practitioner)  I need to do multiclass classification and I only have a decision tree.
 
 Theo (the thoeretician)  Use an  error correcting output code .
 
 Pat  Oh, that’s cool.  But the created binary problems seem unintuitive.  I’m not sure the decision tree can solve them.
 
 Theo  Oh?  Is your problem a decision list?  
 
 Pat  No, I don’t think so.
 
 Theo  Hmm.  Are the classes well separated by axis aligned splits?
 
 Pat  Err, maybe.  I’m not sure.
 
 Theo  Well, if they are, under the IID assumption I can tell you how many samples you need.
 
 Pat  IID?  The data is definitely not IID.
 
 Theo  Oh dear.
 
 Pat  Can we get back to the choice of ECOC?  I suspect we need to build it dynamically in response to which subsets of the labels are empirically separable from each other.
 
 Theo  Ok.  What do you know about your problem?
 
 Pat  Not much.  My friend just gave me the dataset.
 
 Theo  Then, no one can help you.

<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal
is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came
to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for
future conference organizers.Microsoftâ€™s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)We
chose to useCMTover other conference management software mainly because of its
rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has
extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.),
good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent
technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).
Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at
that interface sometime soon!Toronto Matching System (TMS)TMSis now being used
by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an
automated system (developed byLaurent CharlinandRich Zemelat U. Toronto) to

dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.Machine Learning conferences
are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are
taking a turn as program chairs this year, I</p><p>4 0.17716306 <a title="447-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a

<p>Introduction: A big ouch--all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle. Rajnish sends
the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------Sincere apologies to ICML
community for loosing 2012 archived videosWhat happened: In order to publish
2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a
weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the
current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service,
the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had
ignored while removing the data from previous server.What are we doing about
this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can
retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make
sure this does not happen again in future:(1) We are going to create a channel
on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p-</p><p>3 0.61390829 <a title="447-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-24-2009_ICML_discussion_site.html">356 hunch net-2009-05-24-2009 ICML discussion site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Reidhas stepped up and created acomment system for ICML paperswhichGreger
Lindenhas tightly integrated.My understanding is that Mark spent quite a bit
of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex
math mode. This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment
with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out. Please do consider
experimenting with it.</p><p>2 0.92390192 <a title="447-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-27-Antilearning%3A_When_proximity_goes_bad.html">32 hunch net-2005-02-27-Antilearning: When proximity goes bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joel Preddmentioned"Antilearning" byAdam Kowalczyk, which is interesting from
a foundational intuitions viewpoint.There is a pervasive intuition that
"nearby things tend to have the same label". This intuition is instantiated in
SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks. It
turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the
truth.One natural situation where this occurs is in competition. For example,
whenIntelfails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence thatAMDis doing
badly also? Or evidence that AMD is doing well?This violation of the proximity
intuition means that when the number of examples is few,negatinga classifier
which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the
term "antilearning").</p><p>3 0.91412777 <a title="447-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-04-Fall_ML_Conferences.html">316 hunch net-2008-09-04-Fall ML Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a
chance to meet people. Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort.In
short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish
themselves and are heavily reliant on t</p><p>5 0.83394819 <a title="447-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested
Halfspaces and Uphill Decision Trees. Classification PAC-learning, where you
prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to
any distribution over the inputXis extraordinarily challenging as judged by

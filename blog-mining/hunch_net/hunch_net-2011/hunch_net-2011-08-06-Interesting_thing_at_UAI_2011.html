<p>Introduction: This is apaperby Yann LeCun and Fu Jie Huang published atAISTAT 2005. I found
this paper very difficult to read, but it does have some point about a
computational shortcut.This paper takes for granted that the method of solving
a problem is gradient descent on parameters. Given this assumption, the
question arises: Do you want to do gradient descent on a probabilistic model
or something else?All (conditional) probabilistic models have the formp(y|x) =
f(x,y)/Z(x)whereZ(x) = sumyf(x,y)(the paper calls- log f(x,y)an "energy").
Iffis parameterized by somew, the gradient has a term forZ(x), and hence for
every value ofy. The paper claims, that such models can be optimized for
classification purposes using only the correctyand the othery' not ywhich
maximizesf(x,y). This can even be done on unnormalizable models. The paper
further claims that this can be done with an approximate maximum. These claims
are plausible based on experimental results and intuition.It wouldn't surprise
me to learn</p><p>3 0.14367339 <a title="440-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-07-A_NIPS_paper.html">330 hunch net-2008-12-07-A NIPS paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm skipping NIPS this year in favor ofAda, but I wanted to point outthis
paperbyAndriy MnihandGeoff Hinton. The basic claim of the paper is that by
carefully but automatically constructing a binary tree over words, it's
possible to predict words well with huge computational resource savings over
unstructured approaches.I'm interested in this beyond the application to word
prediction because it is relevant to the general normalization problem: If you
want to predict the probability of one of a large number of events, often you
must compute a predicted score for all the events and then normalize, a
computationally inefficient operation. The problem comes up in many places
using probabilistic models, but I've run into it with high-dimensional
regression.There are a couple workarounds for this computational
bug:Approximate. There are many ways. Often the approximations are
uncontrolled (i.e. can be arbitrarily bad), and hence finicky in
application.Avoid. You don't really want a probabili</p><p>4 0.13169827 <a title="440-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-06-Machine_Learning_to_AI.html">352 hunch net-2009-05-06-Machine Learning to AI</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that
Intelligencescreateontologies, which they use, and without the ability to
create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>5 0.10092451 <a title="440-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-18-A_paper_not_at_Snowbird.html">431 hunch net-2011-04-18-A paper not at Snowbird</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all ofAIStatand most of
thelearning workshop, otherwise known as Snowbird, when it's atSnowbird.At
snowbird, the talk onSum-Productnetworks byHoifung Poonstood out to me (Pedro
Domingosis a coauthor.). The basic point was that by appropriately
constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in
probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible
representation+learning algorithm. As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner
than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster
and working better on an image completion task.Snowbird doesn't have real
papers--just the abstract above. I look forward to seeing the paper. (added:
Rodrigo points out the deep learning workshopdraft.)</p><p>6 0.099447757 <a title="440-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-23-Three_levels_of_addressing_the_Netflix_Prize.html">301 hunch net-2008-05-23-Three levels of addressing the Netflix Prize</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Arecent discussionindicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow
people to post comments about recent papers that they liked. I think this
could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests
but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.ACL 2005recently
completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were
either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.David
Chiang,A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation.
(Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that
is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually
translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical
model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you
can learn things like "X 's Y" -> "Y de X" in chinese, where X and Y are
arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, which

<p>Introduction: In the AI-related parts of machine learning, it is often tempting to examine
howyoudo things in order to imagine how a machine should do things. This is
introspection, and it can easily go awry. I will call introspection gone awry
introspectionism.Introspectionism is almost unique to AI (and the AI-related
parts of machine learning) and it can lead to huge wasted effort in research.
It's easiest to show how introspectionism arises by an example.Suppose we want
to solve the problem of navigating a robot from point A to point B given a
camera. Then, the following research action plan might seem natural when you
examine your own capabilities:Build an edge detector for still images.Build an
object recognition system given the edge detector.Build a system to predict
distance and orientation to objects given the object recognition system.Build
a system to plan a path through the scene you construct from {object
identification, distance, orientation} predictions.As you execute the above,

<p>Introduction: In October 2006, the online movie renter, Netflix, announced theNetflix
Prizecontest. They published a comprehensive dataset including more than 100
million movie ratings, which were performed by about 480,000 real customers on
17,770 movies.Ã‚ÂCompetitors in the challenge are required to estimate a few
million ratings.Ã‚ÂTo win the "grand prize," they need to deliver a 10%
improvement in the prediction error compared with the results of Cinematch,
Netflix's proprietary recommender system. Best current results deliver
9.12%improvement, which is quite close to the 10% goal, yet painfully
distant.Ã‚ÂThe Netflix Prize breathed new life and excitement into recommender
systems research. The competition allowed the wide research community to
access a large scale, real life dataset. Beyond this, the competition changed
the rules of the game. Claiming that your nice idea could outperform some
mediocre algorithms on some toy dataset is no longer acceptable. Now
researchers should face a new gol</p><p>6 0.59536475 <a title="440-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I had a chance to attendUAIthis year, where several papers interested me,
including:Hoifung PoonandPedro DomingosSum-Product Networks: A New Deep
Architecture. We'vealready discussed this one, but in a nutshell, they
identify a large class of efficiently normalizable distributions and do
learning with it.Yao-Liang YuandDale Schuurmans,Rank/norm regularization with
closed-form solutions: Application to subspace clustering. This paper is about
matrices, and in particular they prove that certain matrices are the solution
of matrix optimizations. I'm not matrix inclined enough to fully appreciate
this one, but I believe many others may be, and anytime closed form solutions
come into play, you get 2 order of magnitude speedups, as they show
experimentally.Laurent Charlin,Richard ZemelandCraig Boutilier,A Framework for
Optimizing Paper Matching. This is about what works in matching papers to
reviewers, as has been tested at several previous NIPS. We are looking into
using this system for ICM</p><p>2 0.87823808 <a title="440-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-26-Eliminating_the_Birthday_Paradox_for_Universal_Features.html">298 hunch net-2008-04-26-Eliminating the Birthday Paradox for Universal Features</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to expand onthis postwhich describes one of the core tricks for
makingVowpal Wabbitfast and easy to use when learning from text.The central
trick is converting a word (or any other parseable quantity) into a number via
a hash function.Kishoretells me this is a relatively old trick in NLP land,
but it has some added advantages when doing online learning, because you can
learn directly from the existing data without preprocessing the data to create
features (destroying the online property) or using an expensive hashtable
lookup (slowing things down).A central concern for this approach is
collisions, which create a loss of information. If you usemfeatures in an
index space of sizenthe birthday paradox suggests a collision ifm > n0.5,
essentially because there arem2pairs. This is pretty bad, because it says that
with a vocabulary of105features, you might need to have1010entries in your
table.It turns out that redundancy is great for dealing with
collisions.Alexand I worked out a cou</p><p>3 0.84450477 <a title="440-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-16-The_Forgetting.html">233 hunch net-2007-02-16-The Forgetting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many papers do you remember from 2006? 2005? 2002? 1997? 1987? 1967? One
way to judge this would be to look at the citations of the papers you write--
how many came from which year? For myself, the answers on recent papers
are:year200620052002199719871967count4105100This spectrum is fairly typical of
papers in general. There are many reasons that citations are focused on recent
papers.The number of papers being published continues to grow. This is not a
very significant effect, because the rate of publication has not grown nearly
as fast.Dead men don't reject your papers for not citing them. This reason
seems lame, because it's a distortion from the ideal of science. Nevertheless,
it must be stated because the effect can be significant.In 1997, I started as
a PhD student. Naturally, papers after 1997 are better remembered because they
were absorbed in real time. A large fraction of people writing papers and
attending conferences haven't been doing it for 10 years.Old papers aren't</p><p>4 0.8078813 <a title="440-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-12-Online_learning_or_online_preservation_of_learning%3F.html">163 hunch net-2006-03-12-Online learning or online preservation of learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the online learning with experts setting, you observe a set of predictions,
make a decision, and then observe the truth. This process repeats
indefinitely. In this setting, it is possible to prove theorems of the
sort:master algorithm error count < = k* best predictor error count +
c*log(number of predictors)Is this a statement about learning or about
preservation of learning? We did some experiments to analyze the newBinning
algorithmwhich works in this setting. For several UCI datasets, we reprocessed
them so that features could be used as predictors and then applied several
master algorithms. The first graph confirms that Binning is indeed a better
algorithm according to the tightness of the upper bound.Here, "Best" is the
performance of the best expert. "V. Bound" is the bound forVovk's algorithm
(the previous best). "Bound" is the bound for the Binning algorithm. "Binning"
is the performance of the Binning algorithm. The Binning algorithm clearly has
a tighter bound, and the pe</p><p>5 0.69003487 <a title="440-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-The_Producer-Consumer_Model_of_Research.html">51 hunch net-2005-04-01-The Producer-Consumer Model of Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by

On a single machine, I’m not sure how it currently compares to the online LDA in  VW , but the ability to effectively scale across very many machines is surely interesting.</p><p>2 0.15588062 <a title="436-tfidf-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-15-Vowpal_Wabbit_6.0.html">441 hunch net-2011-08-15-Vowpal Wabbit 6.0</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just released  Vowpal Wabbit 6.0 .  Since the last version:
  
 VW is now 2-3 orders of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks to  Alekh .  Given the baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects.  The core improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters (either  Hadoop  or not).   This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with clusters of size 2 (and doesn’t hurt for clusters of size 1).  The core allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused—we’ve already used it to parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.  We’ll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now “README_cluster” and associated scripts should provide a good starting point.
 
 The new  LBFGS  code from  Miro  seems to commonly dominate the existing conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.

<p>Introduction: We are releasing the  Vowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) code  as open source under a BSD (revised) license.  This is a  project at Yahoo! Research  to build a useful large scale learning algorithm which  Lihong Li ,  Alex Strehl , and I have been working on.
 
To appreciate the meaning of “large”, it’s useful to define “small” and “medium”.  A “small” supervised learning problem is one where a human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor.  A “medium” supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern desktop computer.  A “large” supervised learning problem is one which does not fit into the RAM of a normal machine.  VW tackles large scale learning problems by this definition of large.  I’m not aware of any other open source Machine Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist).  A few close ones are:

<p>Introduction: I’ve released  version 5.0  of the  Vowpal Wabbit  online learning software.  The major number has changed since the  last release  because I regard all earlier versions as obsolete—there are several new algorithms & features including substantial changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.  
 
The biggest changes are new algorithms:
  
  Nikos  and I improved the default algorithm.  The basic update rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully controlled so that it’s impossible to overrun the label.  In addition, the normalization has changed.  Computationally, these changes are virtually free and yield better results, sometimes much better.  Less careful updates can be reenabled with –loss_function classic, although results are still not identical to previous due to normalization changes. 
 Nikos also implemented the per-feature learning rates as per these  two   papers .  Often, this works better than the default algorithm.  It isn’t the defa</p><p>5 0.092813797 <a title="436-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Today brings a new release of the  Vowpal Wabbit  fast online learning software.  This time, unlike the previous release, the project itself is going open source, developing via  github .  For example, the lastest and greatest can be downloaded via:
  
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
  
If you aren’t familiar with  git , it’s a distributed version control system which supports quick and easy branching, as well as reconciliation.
 
This version of the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of OSX as well as Linux boxes.
 
As much of the point of this project is pushing the limits of fast and effective machine learning, let me mention a few datapoints from my experience.
  
 The program can effectively scale up to batch-style training on sparse terafeature (i.e. 10 12  sparse feature) size datasets.  The limiting factor is typically i/o.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been wanting to attend the  NYC ML Meetup  for some time and hope to make it  next week on the 25th .   Rob Schapire  is talking about “Playing Repeated Games”, which in my experience is far more relevant to machine learning than the title might indicate.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89427984 <a title="436-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-06-22-Ultra_LDA.html">436 hunch net-2011-06-22-Ultra LDA</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of truth.
 
If  n  players each play each other, you have a tournament.   How do you order the players from weakest to strongest?
 
The standard first attempt is “find the ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as possible”.  This is called the “minimum feedback arcset” problem in the CS theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem.  A basic guarantee holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some “true” intrinsic ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagrees  k  times (due to noise for instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering on at most  2k  edges (and no solution can be better).
 
One standard approach to tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an approximation guarantee.  For example,  Don Coppersmith ,  Lisa Fleischer  and  Atri Rudra  proved that  ordering players according to the number of wins is</p><p>4 0.61270577 <a title="436-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the “right” way to do machine learning.  This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.  The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a reply 2 .
 
The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and general.  Essentially, you first specify a prior  P(D)  over possible processes  D  producing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:   P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)   
After this, hard decisions are made (such as “turn left” or “turn right”) by choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior) loss.
 
This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices of  P(D)  and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice properties:
  
 There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual distribution generating the data is drawn from  P(D)  there is no better method.</p><p>5 0.57103211 <a title="436-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-24-Contextual_Bandits.html">269 hunch net-2007-10-24-Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based content.  This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where ads are specifically matched to interests.  Everyone is familiar with this, because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money this way.
 
The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on what.  A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised—in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn’t generally tell you if a different ad would have been clicked on.  This implies we have a fundamental exploration problem.
 
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “ k -Armed Bandits”, often with various relevant embellishments.  The  k -Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.  On each round:
  
 A policy chooses arm  a  from  1  of  k  arms (i.e. 1 of k ads).

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released theKey Scientific Challengesprogram. There is aMachine
Learninglist I worked on and aStatisticslist whichDeepakworked on.I'm hoping
this is taken quite seriously by graduate students. The primary value, is that
it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research
which would be valuable to make progress on. A good strategy for a beginning
graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make
substantial advances for a PhD. The directions are sufficiently general that
I'm sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.A secondary
point, (which I'm sure is primary for many) is that there is money for
graduate students here. It's unrestricted, so you can use it for any

people.TheKey Scientific Challengesprogram (due March 5) forMachine
LearningandStatisticsoffers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working
on a core problem of interest to Y! If you are already working on one of these
problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you aren't you might want
to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary
of the possible in Machine Learning. There are 7 days left.TheLearning to Rank
challenge(due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm
on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at
an ICML workshop. Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd,
3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreakthe ensembleencountered. If
you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all
learn something. There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.17761979 <a title="425-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-29-Key_Scientific_Challenges_and_the_Franklin_Symposium.html">457 hunch net-2012-02-29-Key Scientific Challenges and the Franklin Symposium</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.40559694 <a title="425-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson's paper, there were (at least) two other papers that
caught my eye at UAI.One wasthis paperby Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul
Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost
all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with
finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look
like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you'd expect from
Sanjoy.The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven't

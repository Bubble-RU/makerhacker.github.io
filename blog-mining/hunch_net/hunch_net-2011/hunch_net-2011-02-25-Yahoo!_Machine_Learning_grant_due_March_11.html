<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>4 0.24625966 <a title="425-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>5 0.21283787 <a title="425-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-02-26-Yahoo%21_ML_events.html">389 hunch net-2010-02-26-Yahoo!

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.19744368 <a title="425-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-30-John_Langford_%26%238211%3B%3E_Yahoo_Research%2C_NY.html">175 hunch net-2006-04-30-John Langford &#8211;> Yahoo Research, NY</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I will join  Yahoo Research  (in New York) after my contract ends at  TTI-Chicago .
 
The deciding reasons are:
  
 Yahoo is running into many hard learning problems.  This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to have the greatest impact. 
 Yahoo Research understands research including publishing, conferences, etc… 
 Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I can help it grow well. 
 Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at all limited to) experimenting with research blogs. 
  
In the end, Yahoo Research seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest difference.  
 
Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research.  We-the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible.  I’ll certainly have fun trying.</p><p>5 0.58146197 <a title="425-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-02-26-Yahoo%21_ML_events.html">389 hunch net-2010-02-26-Yahoo! ML events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers is via bidding, which has steps something like:
  
 Invite people to review 
 Accept papers 
 Reviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are interested in reviewing. 
 Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get approximately the papers they bid for. 
  
At the ICML business meeting,  Andrew McCallum  suggested getting rid of bidding for papers.  A couple reasons were given:
  
  Privacy  The title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to every participating reviewer.  Some authors might be uncomfortable about this for submitted papers.  I’m not sympathetic to this reason: the point of submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited. 
  Cliques   A bidding system is gameable.  If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your submissions, you can each bid for your friend’s papers a</p><p>3 0.19646767 <a title="425-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-29-Key_Scientific_Challenges_and_the_Franklin_Symposium.html">457 hunch net-2012-02-29-Key Scientific Challenges and the Franklin Symposium</a></p>

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>5 0.16426897 <a title="425-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-27-Key_Scientific_Challenges.html">339 hunch net-2009-01-27-Key Scientific Challenges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>6 0.16023484 <a title="425-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-02-ICML%3A_Behind_the_Scenes.html">463 hunch net-2012-05-02-ICML: Behind the Scenes</a></p>

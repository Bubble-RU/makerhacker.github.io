<p>Introduction: Much of the success and popularity of machine learning has been driven by its practical impact. Of course, the evaluation of empirical work is an integral part of the field. But are the existing mechanisms for evaluating algorithms and comparing results good enough? We ( Percy  and  Jake ) believe there are currently a number of shortcomings:  

  
  Incomplete Disclosure:  You read a paper that proposes Algorithm A which is shown to outperform SVMs on two datasets.  Great.  But what about on other datasets?  How sensitive is this result?   What about compute time – does the algorithm take two seconds on a laptop or two weeks on a 100-node cluster? 
  Lack of Standardization:  Algorithm A beats Algorithm B on one version of a dataset.  Algorithm B beats Algorithm A on another version yet uses slightly different preprocessing.  Though doing a head-on comparison would be ideal, it would be tedious since the programs probably use different dataset formats and have a large array of options</p><p>4 0.093163081 <a title="446-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-issues for the moment.
 
The number of posts is a bit over 20. 
The number of people speaking up in discussions is about 10. 
The number of people viewing the site is somewhat more than 100.
 
I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many things.
  
 Many of the  potential uses  haven’t been realized.  This is partly a matter of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no open problems because it’s hard to give them up), and partly a matter of tradition.  In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get everything perfectly right before presentation.  This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.  If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to continue experimenting, I’m going to use the next week as “open problems we</p><p>5 0.092993706 <a title="446-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize.html">402 hunch net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Slashdot  points out  Google Predict .  I’m not privy to the details, but this has the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.  This differs goalwise from  MLcomp —instead of public comparisons for research purposes, it’s about private utilization of good existing algorithms.  It also differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less awkward than using Amazon’s cloud computing.  The latter implies that datasets several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by network and storage.</p><p>6 0.51418895 <a title="446-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-02-Traffic_Prediction_Problem.html">418 hunch net-2010-12-02-Traffic Prediction Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.

<p>Introduction: The  results have been posted , with  CMU first ,  Stanford second , and  Virginia Tech Third .
 
Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

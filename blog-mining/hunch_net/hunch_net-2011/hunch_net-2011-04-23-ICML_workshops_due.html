<p>Introduction: Adam Kalai  points out the  New England Machine Learning Day  May 1 at MSR New England.  There is a poster session with abstracts due April 19.  I understand last year’s  NEML  went well and it’s great to meet your neighbors at regional workshops like this.</p><p>3 0.17522904 <a title="433-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.
  
 
  ICML workshops  
 Due April 1 
 
 
  IJCAI workshops  
 Deadlines Vary 
 
 
 KDD workshops 
 Not yet finalized 
 
  
Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>4 0.15813285 <a title="433-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-03-Monday_announcements.html">446 hunch net-2011-10-03-Monday announcements</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>6 0.13131124 <a title="433-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-03-Fall_Machine_Learning_Events.html">443 hunch net-2011-09-03-Fall Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are planning to have a workshop on atomic learning Jan 7 & 8 at TTI-Chicago.

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.

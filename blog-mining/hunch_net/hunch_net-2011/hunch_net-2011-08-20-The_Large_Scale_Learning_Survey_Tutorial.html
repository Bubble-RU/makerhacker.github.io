ICML. The ideal tutorial attracts a wide audience, provides a gentle and
easily taught introduction to the chosen research area, and also covers the

dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious

learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and

<p>Introduction: I'm releasingversion 4.0(tarball) ofVowpal Wabbit. The biggest change (by far)
in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable
help fromDaniel Hsu.I also took advantage of the major version number to
introduce some incompatible changes, including switching tomurmurhash 2, and
other alterations to cachefiles. You'll need to delete and regenerate them. In
addition, the precise specification for a "tag" (i.e. string that can be used
to identify an example) changed--you can't have a space between the tag and
the '|' at the beginning of the feature namespace.And, of course, we made it
faster.For the future, I put up mytodo listoutlining the major future
improvements I want to see in the code. I'm planning to discuss the current
mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at thelarge scale
machine learning workshopatNIPSlater this week. Several people have asked me
to do a tutorial/walkthrough of VW, which is arranged for friday 2pm in the
works</p><p>3 0.6542142 <a title="442-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-13-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_6.1_%26%23038%3B_the_NIPS_tutorial.html">451 hunch net-2011-12-13-Vowpal Wabbit version 6.1 &#038; the NIPS tutorial</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just madeversion 6.1ofVowpal Wabbit. Relative to6.0, there are few new
features, but many refinements.The cluster parallel learning code better
supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been
mostly removed. This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning
core.The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l1(via
a truncated gradient variant) and l2regularization, and a generalized form of
variable metric learning.There is a solid persistent server mode which can
train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in
text or binary.This should be a very good release if you are just getting
started, as we've made it compile more automatically out of the box, have
several newexamplesand updated documentation.Aspertradition, we're planning to
do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at theparallel learning workshopat 2pm
Spanish time Friday. I'll cover the basics, leaving the fun stuff for
others.Mirowill cov</p><p>4 0.63634747 <a title="442-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-20-The_Workshop_on_Cores%2C_Clusters%2C_and_Clouds.html">404 hunch net-2010-08-20-The Workshop on Cores, Clusters, and Clouds</a></p>

suggest that some method of saying "I prefer this predictor to that predictor"
is useful and necessary. Examples include Bayesian reasoning, prediction
bounds, and online learning. One difficulty which arises is that the manner
and meaning of saying "I prefer this predictor to that predictor"
differs.Prior(Bayesian) A prior is a probability distribution over a set of
distributions which expresses a belief in the probability that some
distribution is the distribution generating the data."Prior"(Prediction bounds
& online learning) The "prior" is a measure over a set of classifiers which
expresses the degree to which you hope the classifier will predict
well.Bias(Regularization, Early termination of neural network training, etcâ&euro;Ś)
The bias is some (often implicitly specified by an algorithm) way of
preferring one predictor to another.This only scratches the surface--there are
yet more subtleties. For example the (as</p><p>3 0.76966953 <a title="442-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-17-Going_all_the_Way%2C_Sometimes.html">42 hunch net-2005-03-17-Going all the Way, Sometimes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At many points in research, you face a choice: should I keep on improving some
old piece of technology or should I do something new? For example:Should I
refine bounds to make them tighter?Should I take some learning theory and turn
it into a learning algorithm?Should I implement the learning algorithm?Should
I test the learning algorithm widely?Should I release the algorithm as source
code?Should I go see what problems people actually need to solve?The universal
temptation of people attracted to research is doing something new. That is
sometimes the right decision, but is also often not. I'd like to discuss some
reasons why not.ExpertiseOnce expertise are developed on some subject, you are
the right person to refine them.What is the real problem?Continually improving
a piece of technology is a mechanism forcing you to confront this question. In
many cases, this confrontation is uncomfortable because you discover that your
method has fundamental flaws with respect to solving the real p</p><p>4 0.75626719 <a title="442-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-28-Computational_Consequences_of_Classification.html">274 hunch net-2007-11-28-Computational Consequences of Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In theregression vs classification debate, I'm adding a new "pro" to
classification. It seems there are computational shortcuts available for
classification which simply aren't available for regression. This arises in
several situations.Inactive learningit is sometimes possible to find aneerror
classifier with justlog(e)labeled samples. Only much more modest improvements
appear to be achievable for squared loss regression. The essential reason is
that the loss function on many examples is flat with respect to large
variations in the parameter spaces of a learned classifier, which implies that
many of these classifiers do not need to be considered. In contrast, for
squared loss regression, most substantial variations in the parameter space
influence the loss at most points.In budgeted learning, where there is either
a computational time constraint or a feature cost constraint, a classifier can
sometimes be learned to very high accuracy under the constraints while a
squared loss regresso</p><p>5 0.75199431 <a title="442-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>6 0.75182128 <a title="442-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I would like to encourage people to consider giving a tutorial at next years ICML. The ideal tutorial attracts a wide audience, provides a gentle and easily taught introduction to the chosen research area, and also covers the most important contributions in depth.
 
Submissions are due January 14 Â (about two weeks before paper deadline).

<p>Introduction: At NIPS I’m giving a  tutorial on Learning to Interact .  In essence this is about dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework.  Relative to  previous tutorials , I’ll be covering several new results that changed my understanding of the nature of the problem.  Note that  Judea Pearl  and  Elias Bareinboim  have a  tutorial on causality .  This might appear similar, but is quite different in practice.  Pearl and Bareinboim’s tutorial will be about the general concepts while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case, including code.  Luckily, they have the right order.  I recommend going to both   
 
I also just released version 7.4 of  Vowpal Wabbit .  When I was a frustrated learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning reductions to solve problems.  I’ve been slowly discovering why with VW, and addressing the issues.  One of the issues is that machine learning itself was not automatic enough, while another is that creatin</p><p>4 0.12458862 <a title="442-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-20-The_Workshop_on_Cores%2C_Clusters%2C_and_Clouds.html">404 hunch net-2010-08-20-The Workshop on Cores, Clusters, and Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alekh ,  John ,  Ofer , and I are organizing a  workshop  at  NIPS  this year on learning in parallel and distributed environments.  The general interest level in parallel learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.  Please join us if you are parallel-interested.
 
And, if you are working in the area of parallel learning, please consider  submitting an abstract  due Oct. 17 for presentation at the workshop.</p><p>5 0.12386163 <a title="442-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-08-Fast_SVMs.html">54 hunch net-2005-04-08-Fast SVMs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There was a  presentation at snowbird  about parallelized support vector machines.  In many cases, people parallelize by ignoring serial operations, but that is not what happened hereâ&euro;&rdquo;they parallelize with optimizations.  Consequently, this seems to be the fastest SVM in existence.

<p>Introduction: I just made  version 6.1  of  Vowpal Wabbit .  Relative to  6.0 , there are few new features, but many refinements. 
  
 The cluster parallel learning code better supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been mostly removed.  This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning core. 
 The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l 1  (via a truncated gradient variant) and l 2  regularization, and a generalized form of variable metric learning. 
 There is a solid persistent server mode which can train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in text or binary. 
  
This should be a very good release if you are just getting started, as we’ve made it compile more automatically out of the box, have several new  examples  and updated documentation.

<p>Introduction: Previously, we discussed  parallel machine learning  a bit.  As parallel ML is rather difficult, I’d like to describe my thinking at the moment, and ask for advice from the rest of the world.  This is particularly relevant right now, as I’m attending a workshop tomorrow on parallel ML.
 
Parallelizing slow algorithms seems uncompelling.  Parallelizing many algorithms also seems uncompelling, because the effort required to parallelize is substantial.  This leaves the question: Which one fast algorithm is the best to parallelize?  What is a substantially different second?
 
One compellingly fast simple algorithm is online gradient descent on a linear representation.  This is the core of Leon’s  sgd  code and  Vowpal Wabbit .   Antoine Bordes  showed a variant was competitive in the  large scale learning challenge .  It’s also a decades old primitive which has been reused in many algorithms, and continues to be reused.  It also applies to online  learning  rather than just online  optimiz</p><p>5 0.58541441 <a title="442-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-20-The_Workshop_on_Cores%2C_Clusters%2C_and_Clouds.html">404 hunch net-2010-08-20-The Workshop on Cores, Clusters, and Clouds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkerman  initiated an effort to create an  edited book on parallel machine learning  that  Misha  and I have been helping with.  The breadth of efforts to parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small fraction initially.
 
This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together a  survey tutorial on the subject of parallel learning  for  KDD , tomorrow.  This tutorial is  not  limited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms have come out since we started inviting chapters.  
 
This tutorial should interest anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data, anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth   
 
(Also note the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of trying to speed up learning algorithms.

<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereira  points out a fun  Prediction Competition .   Francisco says:
 
DARPA is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts, motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.
 
The challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly interesting:
  
  This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably hard. 
  This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot deal with. 
  This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and preprocessed neuroimaging dataset. 
  DARPA is offering prizes!</p><p>4 0.71481395 <a title="442-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code.  There are several important concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.
  
  Speed   The rate at which data sources are growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of computational power.  Garbage collected languages ( java ,  ocaml ,  perl  and  python ) often have several issues here.
 
 Garbage collection often implies that floating point numbers are “boxed”: every float is represented by a pointer to a float.  Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles long. 
 Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used than is necessary.   This has a variable effect.  I</p><p>5 0.67063475 <a title="442-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-26-NIPS_2010.html">420 hunch net-2010-12-26-NIPS 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoyed attending  NIPS  this year, with several things interesting me.  For the conference itself:
  
  Peter Welinder ,  Steve  Branson ,  Serge Belongie , and  Pietro Perona ,  The Multidimensional Wisdom of Crowds .  This paper is about using  mechanical turk  to get label information, with results superior to a majority vote approach. 
  David McAllester ,  Tamir Hazan , and  Joseph Keshet   Direct Loss Minimization for Structured Prediction .  This is about another technique for directly optimizing the loss in structured prediction, with an application to speech recognition.  
  Mohammad Saberian  and  Nuno Vasconcelos   Boosting Classifier Cascades .  This is about an algorithm for simultaneously optimizing loss and computation in a classifier cascade construction.  There were several other papers on cascades which are worth looking at if interested.

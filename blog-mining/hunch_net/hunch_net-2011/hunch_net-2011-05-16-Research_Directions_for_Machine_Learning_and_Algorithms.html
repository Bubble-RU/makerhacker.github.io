<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.  This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where the world interacts with an agent as:
  
 The world announces an observation  x . 
 The agent makes a choice  a . 
 The world announces a reward  r . 
  
The goal here is to maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent.  No particular structure relating  x  to  a  or  a  to  r  is implied by this setting so we do not know effective general algorithms for the agent.  It’s very easy to prove lower bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here—just consider the case where actions are unrelated to rewards.  Nevertheless, there is a real sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this setting, somehow succeeding.

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for the  reductions tutorial   Alina ,  Bianca , and I are planning to do at  ICML .  Please come, if you are interested.
 
Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building new useful abstractions.  The running example I’ll use is  learning reductions  where I have experience.  The basic abstraction here is that we can build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a small expected regret.   This is used repeatedly to solve more complex problems.
 
In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly difficult.
  
 It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits.  People rarely see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new abstractions.    Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, yo</p><p>5 0.17733924 <a title="435-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance.

<p>Introduction: Suppose we have a set of observations over time  x 1 ,x 2 ,…,x t   and want to predict some future event  y t+1  .  An inevitable problem arises, because learning a predictor  h(x 1 ,…,x t )  of  y t+1   is generically intractable due to the size of the input.  To make this problem tractable, what’s necessary is a method for summarizing the relevant information in past observations for the purpose of prediction in the future.  In other words, state is required.
 
Existing approaches for deriving state have some limitations.
  
  Hidden Markov models  learned with EM suffer from local minima, use tabular learning approaches which provide dubious generalization ability, and often require substantial a.priori specification of the observations. 
  Kalman Filters  and  Particle Filters  are very parametric in the sense that substantial information must be specified up front.

<p>Introduction: One way to distinguish different learning algorithms is by their ability or inability to easily use an input variable as the predicted output.  This is desirable for at least two reasons:
  
  Modularity   If we want to build complex learning systems via reuse of a subsystem, it’s important to have compatible I/O. 
  “Prior” knowledge   Machine learning is often applied in situations where we do have some knowledge of what the right solution is, often in the form of an existing system.  In such situations, it’s good to start with a learning algorithm that can be at least as good as any existing system. 
  
When doing classification, most learning algorithms can do this.  For example, a decision tree can split on a feature, and then classify.  The real differences come up when we attempt regression.  Many of the algorithms we know and commonly use are not idempotent predictors.
  
 Logistic regressors can not be idempotent, because all input features are mapped through a nonlinearity.</p><p>5 0.73407304 <a title="435-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-21-Nearly_all_natural_problems_require_nonlinearity.html">337 hunch net-2009-01-21-Nearly all natural problems require nonlinearity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One conventional wisdom is that learning algorithms with linear representations are sufficient to solve natural learning  problems.  This conventional wisdom appears unsupported by empirical evidence as far as I can tell.  In nearly all vision, language, robotics, and speech applications I know where machine learning is effectively applied, the approach involves either a linear representation on hand crafted features capturing substantial nonlinearities or learning directly on nonlinear representations.  
 
There are a few exceptions to this—for example, if the problem of interest to you is predicting the next word given previous words, n-gram methods have been shown effective.  Viewed the right way, n-gram methods are essentially linear predictors on an enormous sparse feature space, learned from an enormous number of examples.  Hal’s post  here  describes some of this in more detail.
 
In contrast, if you go to a machine learning conference, a large number of the new algorithms are v</p><p>6 0.72755533 <a title="435-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: from brain cancer.  I asked  Misha  who worked with him to write about it. 
  
Partha Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43. 
 
I first met Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation. I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus fo</p><p>2 0.96367234 <a title="435-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-14-Clever_Methods_of_Overfitting.html">19 hunch net-2005-02-14-Clever Methods of Overfitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Overfitting” is traditionally defined as training some flexible representation so that it memorizes the data but fails to predict well in the future. For this post, I will define overfitting more generally as over-representing the performance of systems.  There are two styles of general overfitting: overrepresenting performance on particular datasets and (implicitly) overrepresenting performance of a method on future datasets.  
 
We should all be aware of these methods, avoid them where possible, and take them into account otherwise.   I have used “reproblem” and “old datasets”, and may have participated in “overfitting by review”—some of these are very difficult to avoid.

<p>Introduction: Muthu  invited me to the workshop on  algorithms in the field , with the goal of providing a sense of where near-term research should go.  When the time came though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other people to comment.
 
There are several things I didn’t fully understand when I went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago.  I’d like to repeat them as people in academia may not yet understand them intuitively.
  
 Almost all the big impact algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time.  Think about caching, hashing, sorting, filtering, etc… and you have a sense of what some of the most heavily used algorithms are.  This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and languages.  Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where inference is often a superlinear operation—think about the  n 2   dependence on the number of states in a  Hidden Markov Model  and Kernelized  Support Vecto</p><p>4 0.92288697 <a title="435-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance. 
 How does the algorithm scale with the number of</p><p>5 0.92127317 <a title="435-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-01-A_conversation_between_Theo_and_Pat.html">176 hunch net-2006-05-01-A conversation between Theo and Pat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pat (the practitioner)  I need to do multiclass classification and I only have a decision tree.
 
 Theo (the thoeretician)  Use an  error correcting output code .
 
 Pat  Oh, that’s cool.  But the created binary problems seem unintuitive.  I’m not sure the decision tree can solve them.
 
 Theo  Oh?  Is your problem a decision list?  
 
 Pat  No, I don’t think so.
 
 Theo  Hmm.  Are the classes well separated by axis aligned splits?
 
 Pat  Err, maybe.  I’m not sure.
 
 Theo  Well, if they are, under the IID assumption I can tell you how many samples you need.
 
 Pat  IID?  The data is definitely not IID.
 
 Theo  Oh dear.
 
 Pat  Can we get back to the choice of ECOC?  I suspect we need to build it dynamically in response to which subsets of the labels are empirically separable from each other.
 
 Theo  Ok.  What do you know about your problem?
 
 Pat  Not much.  My friend just gave me the dataset.
 
 Theo  Then, no one can help you.

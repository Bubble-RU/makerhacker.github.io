</p><p>2 The issue  Google engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic queries on google. [sent-10, score-0.631]
</p><p>3 com using Internet Explorer with the Bing toolbar and later noticed some synthetic responses from Bing with the synthetic queries. [sent-12, score-0.55]
</p><p>4 One is the  privacy disagreement  “ Big Brother   Microsoft  is looking at what I search and using it”. [sent-14, score-0.595]
</p><p>5 In the end, I think companies should simply do their best to accept a user’s wishes, so those who want privacy can have it, and those who want to contribute their data towards improving a search engine can do so. [sent-16, score-0.808]
</p><p>6 What I believe happened was a user feedback process, where users queried Google, clicked on a result, informed Microsoft/Bing of the query and clicked result, and their preference was used to promote the search result within Bing. [sent-21, score-1.222]
</p><p>7 Should a user be allowed to:     Reveal to their chosen search engine their preferred result? [sent-23, score-0.83]
</p><p>8 Reveal to a competitor’s search engine their preferred result? [sent-24, score-0.497]
</p><p>9 If you answer ‘no’ to the first, you are deeply against user freedom in a manner I can’t sympathize with. [sent-25, score-0.442]
</p><p>10 If you answer ‘yes’ to the first, and ‘no’ to the second, then you are still somewhat against user freedom. [sent-26, score-0.462]
</p><p>11 However, in all instances I’m aware of, users knowingly agree to a contract providing access to the information with limitations. [sent-29, score-0.449]
</p><p>12 You could argue that it’s ok for Microsoft to take advantage of revealed user interaction, but it’s still a matter of following rather than leading. [sent-33, score-0.497]
</p><p>13 A basic truth seen in many ways, is that the proper incorporation of new sources of information always improves results. [sent-35, score-0.308]
</p><p>14 More generally, it’s true in basic knowledge engineering, where people fuse sources of information to create a better system, and I’m virtually certain it’s true of the ranking algorithms behind Google and Bing, which are surely complex beasts taking into account many sources of information. [sent-37, score-0.64]
</p><p>15 If that’s the case, Google will either follow Microsoft’s lead taking into account user feedback as Microsoft does, or risk becoming obsolete. [sent-39, score-0.497]
</p><p>16 A basic truth, is that building a successful search engine is extraordinarily difficult. [sent-41, score-0.427]
</p><p>17 This is revealed by search market share, but also by simply thinking about the logistics involved. [sent-42, score-0.363]
</p><p>18 If we prefer a future where there is a healthy competition amongst search engines, then it’s important to lower these barriers to entry so new people with new ideas can more easily test them out. [sent-44, score-0.405]
</p><p>19 One way to lower the barrier to entry is to accept that users can share their interaction, even with a competitor’s search engine. [sent-45, score-0.673]
</p><p>20 I would be more sympathetic to a position for allowing users of Internet Explorer a built-in means to choose to share their search behavior with Google or other search engines on an equal footing. [sent-48, score-1.038]

<p>Introduction: I just visited  Yahoo Research  which has several fundamental learning problems near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well.  Here are 3 of them.
  
  Ranking   This is the canonical problem of all search engines.  It is made extra difficult for several reasons.
 
 There is relatively little “good” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as click through rates). 
 The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of 
rankings. 
 It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ranking’ or as ‘regression’ which is then used to produce a 
ranking. 
 
 
  Collaborative filtering  Yahoo has a large number of recommendation systems for music, movies, etc…  In these sorts of systems, users specify how they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more examples of things they might like

<p>Introduction: “Search” is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful.   Concrete examples include  Deep Blue  which beat the world chess champion and  Chinook  the champion checkers program.  A set of core search techniques exist including A * , alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different search problems.
 
Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search.  Given also that  humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again.  However, the big successful search-based systems have typically not used “smart” search algorithms.  Insteady they have optimized for very fast search.  This is not for lack of trying… many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to various degrees of success.   For example,  Knightcap  achieves good-but-not-stellar chess playing performance, and  TD-gammon</p><p>6 0.15757462 <a title="423-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: According to the  New York Times ,  Yahoo is releasing Project Panama shortly .  Project Panama is about better predicting which advertisements are relevant to a search, implying a higher click through rate, implying larger income for  Yahoo .  There are two things that seem interesting here:
  
 A significant portion of that improved accuracy is almost certainly machine learning at work. 
 The quantitative effect is huge—the estimate in the article is $600*10 6 . 
  
 Google  already has such improvements and  Microsoft Search  is surely working on them, which suggest this is (perhaps) a $10 9  per year machine learning problem. 
 
The exact methodology under use is unlikely to be publicly discussed in the near future because of the competitive enivironment.  Hopefully we’ll have some public “war stories” at some point in the future when this information becomes less sensitive.  For now, it’s reassuring to simply note that machine learning is having a big impact.</p><p>5 0.69889468 <a title="423-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and stick with it.  For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not enough: they must design new notations for new problems.  The design of good notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a line of research greatly.  
 
Before we had mathematical notation, equations were all written out in language.  Since words have multiple meanings and variable precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous.  A good representative example of this is the legalese in the tax code.  Since we want greater precision and clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.
 
One fundamental thing to understand about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely capable.  This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better than another.  This observation is easier to miss than you might</p><p>2 0.86706555 <a title="423-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-19-How_is_Compressed_Sensing_going_to_change_Machine_Learning_%3F.html">248 hunch net-2007-06-19-How is Compressed Sensing going to change Machine Learning ?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing  (CS) is a new framework developed by  Emmanuel Candes ,  Terry Tao  and  David Donoho . To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the growing subject:  http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/  ]

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the “Bing copies Google” discussion  here ,  here , and  here , because there are data-related issues which the general public may not understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.
 
As a not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have.  I work at  Yahoo! , which has started using  Bing .  This might predispose me towards Bing, but on the other hand I’m still at Yahoo!, and have been using  Linux  exclusively as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches.  And,  on the gripping hand , I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about the basic  principles of incorporating user feedback in machine learning .  Also note, this post is not  related to official Yahoo! policy, it’s just my personal view.
 
 The issue  Google engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com using Internet Explorer with the Bing toolbar and later</p><p>4 0.81702077 <a title="423-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Williamson  and I are the learning theory PC members at  NIPS  this year.  This is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers.  I think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:
  
 Making community standards a matter of public record seems healthy.  It give us a chance to debate what is and is not the right standard.  It might even give us a bit more consistency across the years. 
 It may save us all time.  There are a number of papers submitted which just aren’t there yet.  Avoiding submitting is the right decision in this case. 
  
There are several criteria for judging a paper.  All of these were active this year.  Some criteria are uncontroversial while others may be so.
  
 The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results.  A surprising number of papers fail this test.  This criteria seems essential to the definition of “theory”.

<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround. 
 I setup a  feedburner account . 
 I added an RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like to follow.  This is something that I’ve wanted to do for awhile. 
 Many other minor changes in font and format, with some help from  Alina .

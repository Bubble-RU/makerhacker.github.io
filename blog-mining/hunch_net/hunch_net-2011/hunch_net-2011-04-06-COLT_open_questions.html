<p>Introduction: COLT has a  call for open problems  due March 21.  I encourage anyone with a specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in.  Just the effort of specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it.  To increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the solution.  (Perhaps I should raise the  $500 bounty  on the  K-fold cross-validation problem  as it hasnâ&euro;&trade;t yet been solved).</p><p>3 0.14465047 <a title="429-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-28-Open_Problems_for_Colt.html">47 hunch net-2005-03-28-Open Problems for Colt</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adam Klivans  and  Rocco Servedio  are looking for  open (learning theory) problems  for  COLT .

<p>Introduction: Centmail  is a scheme which makes charity donations have a secondary value, as a stamp for email.  When discussed on  newscientist ,  slashdot , and others, some of the comments make the academic review process appear thoughtful   .  Some prominent fallacies are:
  
 Costing money fallacy.  Some commenters appear to believe the system charges money per email.  Instead, the basic idea is that users get an extra benefit from donations to a charity and participation is strictly voluntary.  The solution to this fallacy is simply reading  the details . 
 Single solution fallacy.  Some commenters seem to think this is proposed as a complete solution to spam, and since not everyone will opt to participate, it won’t work.  But a complete solution is not at all necessary or even possible given the  flag-day problem .  Deployed machine learning systems for fighting spam are great at taking advantage of a partial solution.  The solution to this fallacy is learning about machine learning.

<p>Introduction: Martin Pool  and I recently discussed the similarities and differences between academia and open source programming.   
 
Similarities:
  
  Cost profile   Research and programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort is required to produce something useful, and then “anyone” can use it.  (The “anyone” is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently technical people could use it.) 
  Wealth profile  A “wealthy” academic or open source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in research or programs.  Much of academia is a “gift culture”: whoever gives the most is most respected. 
  Problems   Both academia and open source programming suffer from similar problems.
 
 Whether or not (and which) open source program is used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability or usefulness.  Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to directions of research.

<p>Introduction: Sasha  is the  open problems  chair for both  COLT   and   ICML .  Open problems will be presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day.   COLT has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML.  If you have a difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider submitting it for review,  due March 16 .  You’ll benefit three ways: 
  
 The effort of writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand the nature of the problem. 
 Your problem will be officially published and citable. 
 You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people. 
  
The general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical variety.

<p>Introduction: Iain  noticed that hunch.net had zero width divs hiding spammy URLs.  Some investigation reveals that the wordpress version being used (2.0.3) had security flaws.  I’ve upgraded to the latest, rotated passwords, and removed the spammy URLs.  I don’t believe any content was lost.  You can check your own and other sites for a similar problem by greping for “width:0″ or “width: 0″ in the delivered html source.</p><p>4 0.72897106 <a title="429-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-06-Exact_Online_Learning_for_Classification.html">78 hunch net-2005-06-06-Exact Online Learning for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jacob Abernethy and I have found a computationally tractable method for computing an optimal (or near optimal depending on setting) master algorithm combining expert predictions addressing  this open problem .  A draft is  here .  
 
The effect of this improvement seems to be about a factor of  2  decrease in the regret (= error rate minus best possible error rate) for the low error rate situation.  (At large error rates, there may be no significant difference.)  
 
There are some unfinished details still to consider:
  
 When we remove all of the approximation slack from online learning, is the result a satisfying learning algorithm, in practice?  I consider online learning is one of the more compelling methods of analyzing and deriving algorithms, but that expectation must be either met or not by this algorithm 
 Some extra details: The algorithm is optimal given a small amount of side information ( k  in the draft).  What is the best way to remove this side information?  The removal</p><p>5 0.66200012 <a title="429-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-02-Thoughts_regarding_%26%238220%3BIs_machine_learning_different_from_statistics%3F%26%238221%3B.html">230 hunch net-2007-02-02-Thoughts regarding &#8220;Is machine learning different from statistics?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given John’s recent posts on CMU’s new machine learning department and “Deep Learning,” I asked for an opportunity to give a computational learning theory perspective on these issues.
 
To my mind, the answer to the question “Are the core problems from machine learning different from the core problems of statistics?” is a clear Yes.  The point of this post is to describe a core problem in machine learning that is computational in nature and will appeal to statistical learning folk (as an extreme example note that if P=NP– which, for all we know, is true– then we would suddenly find almost all of our favorite machine learning problems considerably more tractable).
 
If the central question of statistical learning theory were crudely summarized as “given a hypothesis with a certain loss bound over a test set, how well will it generalize?” then the central question of computational learning theory might be “how can we find such a hypothesis efficently (e.g., in polynomial-time)?”

<p>Introduction: Netflix is  running a contest  to improve recommender prediction systems.   A 10% improvement over their current system yields a $1M prize.  Failing that, the best smaller improvement yields a smaller $50K prize.  This contest looks quite real, and the $50K prize money is almost certainly achievable with a bit of thought.  The contest also comes with a dataset which is apparently 2 orders of magnitude larger than any other public recommendation system datasets.</p><p>3 0.14014338 <a title="427-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-21-Netflix_finishes_%28and_starts%29.html">371 hunch net-2009-09-21-Netflix finishes (and starts)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attended the  Netflix prize  ceremony this morning.  The press conference part is  covered fine elsewhere , with the basic outcome being that  BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos  won over  The Ensemble  by 15-20  minutes , because they were tied in performance on the ultimate holdout set.  I’m sure the individual participants will have many chances to speak about the solution.  One of these is Bell at the  NYAS ML symposium on Nov. 6 .
 
Several additional details may interest ML people.
  
 The degree of overfitting exhibited by the difference in performance on the  leaderboard test set  and the ultimate hold out set was small, but determining at .02 to .03%. 
 A tie was possible, because the rules cut off measurements below the fourth digit based on significance concerns.  In actuality, of course, the scores do differ before rounding, but everyone I spoke to claimed not to know how.  The complete dataset has been  released on UCI , so each team could compute their own score to whatever accu</p><p>4 0.13142632 <a title="427-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-The_cross_validation_problem%3A_cash_reward.html">86 hunch net-2005-06-28-The cross validation problem: cash reward</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on the  public Netflix test set  by a  3-way ensemble team .  This is just in time for  Yehuda ‘s presentation at  KDD , which I’m sure will be one of the best attended ever.  
 
This isn’t quite over—there are a few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test set, but I expect not.  
 
Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of ensemble methods.</p><p>6 0.091328546 <a title="427-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-11-AAAI_blog.html">92 hunch net-2005-07-11-AAAI blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In October 2006, the online movie renter, Netflix, announced the  Netflix Prize  contest. They published a comprehensive dataset including more than 100 million movie ratings, which were performed by about 480,000 real customers on 17,770 movies. Ã‚Â   Competitors in the challenge are required to estimate a few million ratings. Ã‚Â   To win the “grand prize,” they need to deliver a 10% improvement in the prediction error compared with the results of Cinematch, Netflix’s proprietary recommender system. Best current results deliver 9.12%  improvement , which is quite close to the 10% goal, yet painfully distant. 
   Ã‚Â   The Netflix Prize breathed new life and excitement into recommender systems research. The competition allowed the wide research community to access a large scale, real life dataset. Beyond this, the competition changed the rules of the game. Claiming that your nice idea could outperform some mediocre algorithms on some toy dataset is no longer acceptable.

<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  There were 303 registrations, up a bit from  last year .  I particularly enjoyed talks by  Bill Freeman  on vision and ML,  Jon Lenchner  on strategy in Jeopardy, and  Tara N. Sainath  and Brian Kingsbury on  deep learning for speech recognition .  If anyone has suggestions or thoughts for next year, please speak up.
 
I also attended  Strata + Hadoop World  for the first time.  This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee.  This is ground zero for the  Big data  buzzword, and I see now why.  It’s about data, and the word “big” is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it.  There were essentially zero academic talks.  Instead, the focus was on war stories, product announcements, and education.  The general level of education is much lower—explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary operating point.  Nevertheless that’s happening, a</p><p>5 0.03410266 <a title="427-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-21-Netflix_finishes_%28and_starts%29.html">371 hunch net-2009-09-21-Netflix finishes (and starts)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attended the  Netflix prize  ceremony this morning.  The press conference part is  covered fine elsewhere , with the basic outcome being that  BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos  won over  The Ensemble  by 15-20  minutes , because they were tied in performance on the ultimate holdout set.  I’m sure the individual participants will have many chances to speak about the solution.  One of these is Bell at the  NYAS ML symposium on Nov. 6 .
 
Several additional details may interest ML people.
  
 The degree of overfitting exhibited by the difference in performance on the  leaderboard test set  and the ultimate hold out set was small, but determining at .02 to .03%. 
 A tie was possible, because the rules cut off measurements below the fourth digit based on significance concerns.

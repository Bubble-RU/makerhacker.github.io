improvement over their current system yields a $1M prize. Failing that, the

<p>Introduction: I attended theNetflix prizeceremony this morning. The press conference part
iscovered fine elsewhere, with the basic outcome being thatBellKor's Pragmatic
Chaoswon overThe Ensembleby 15-20minutes, because they were tied in
performance on the ultimate holdout set. I'm sure the individual participants
will have many chances to speak about the solution. One of these is Bell at
theNYAS ML symposium on Nov. 6.Several additional details may interest ML
people.The degree of overfitting exhibited by the difference in performance on
theleaderboard test setand the ultimate hold out set was small, but
determining at .02 to .03%.A tie was possible, because the rules cut off
measurements below the fourth digit based on significance concerns. In
actuality, of course, the scores do differ before rounding, but everyone I
spoke to claimed not to know how. The complete dataset has beenreleased on
UCI, so each team could compute their own score to whatever accuracy desired.I

<p>Introduction: A calibrated predictor is one which predicts the probability of a binary event
with the property: For all predictionsp, the proportion of the time that1is
observed isp.Since there are infinitely manyp, this definition must be
"softened" to make sense for any finite number of samples. The standard method
for "softening" is to consider all predictions in a small neighborhood about
each possiblep.A great deal of effort has been devoted to strategies for
achieving calibrated (such ashere) prediction. With statements like: (under
minimal conditions) you can always make calibrated predictions.Given the
strength of these statements, we might conclude we are done, but that would be
a "confusion of ends". A confusion of ends arises in the following way:We want
good probabilistic predictions.Good probabilistic predictions are
calibrated.Therefore, we want calibrated predictions.The "Therefore" step
misses the fact that calibration is a necessary but not

<p>Introduction: In 2001, the "Journal of Machine Learning Research" was created in reaction to
unadaptive publisher policies atMLJ. Essentially, with the creation of the
internet, the bottleneck in publishing research shifted from publishing to
research. Thedeclaration of independenceaccompanying this move expresses the
reasons why in greater detail.MLJ has strongly changed its policy in reaction
to this. In particular, there is no longer an assignment of copyright to the
publisher (*), and MLJ regularly sponsors many student "best paper awards"
across several conferences with cash prizes. This is an advantage of MLJ over
JMLR: MLJ can afford to sponsor cash prizes for the machine learning
community. The remaining disadvantage is that reading papers in MLJ sometimes
requires searching for the author's website where the free version is
available. In contrast, JMLR articles are freely available to everyone off the
JMLR website. Whether or not this disadvantage cancels the advantage is
debatable, but ess</p><p>4 0.031481966 <a title="427-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Watchword%3A_Probability.html">5 hunch net-2005-01-26-Watchword: Probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then
it has probability ab</p><p>5 0.026679004 <a title="427-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-11-Yahoo%26%238217%3Bs_Learning_Problems..html">156 hunch net-2006-02-11-Yahoo&#8217;s Learning Problems.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>6 0.023961663 <a title="427-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-07-Pittsburgh_Mind_Reading_Competition.html">155 hunch net-2006-02-07-Pittsburgh Mind Reading Competition</a></p>

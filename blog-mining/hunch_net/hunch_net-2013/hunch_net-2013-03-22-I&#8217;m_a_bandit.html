<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeck  points out  COLT   registration  with a May 13 early registration deadline.   The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs with a $300 registration fee.
 
 ICML   registration  is also available, at about an x3 higher cost.  My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>3 0.16249746 <a title="480-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time. 
  Feedback failure .  This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from</p><p>5 0.12808228 <a title="480-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.  This isn’t necessarily</p><p>6 0.12576398 <a title="480-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-13-David_Pennock_starts_Oddhead.html">214 hunch net-2006-10-13-David Pennock starts Oddhead</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs. 
 
The good news from a learning perspective is that (based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at learning and learning-related fields.

<p>Introduction: A language is a set of primitives which can be combined to succesfully create complex objects.  Languages arise in all sorts of situations: mechanical construction, martial arts, communication, etc…  Languages appear to be the key to succesfully creating complex objects—it is difficult to come up with any convincing example of a complex object which is not built using some language.  Since languages are so crucial to success, it is interesting to organize various machine learning research programs by language.
 
The most common language in machine learning are languages for representing the solution to machine learning.   This includes:
  
  Bayes Nets and Graphical Models  A language for representing probability distributions.  The key concept supporting modularity is conditional independence.   Michael Kearns  has been working on extending this to game theory. 
  Kernelized Linear Classifiers  A language for representing linear separators, possibly in a large space.

<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the form 
FOR  n =1,2,…: 
— Reality chooses a datum  x n  . 
— Decision Maker chooses his decision  d n  . 
— Reality chooses an observation  y n  . 
— Decision Maker suffers loss   L ( y n  , d n  ). 
END FOR. 
The observation  y n   can be, for example, tomorrow’s stock price and the decision  d n   the number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy.  The datum  x n   ideally contains all information that might be relevant in making this decision.  We do not want to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and data.
 
Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision rule  D  mapping each datum  x  to a decision  D ( x ).  Can we perform as well, or almost as well, as  D , without knowing it?  This is essentially a special case of the problem of  on-line learning .
 
This is a simple result of this kind.  Suppose the data  x n   are taken from [0,1] and  L ( y , d )=| y – d |.

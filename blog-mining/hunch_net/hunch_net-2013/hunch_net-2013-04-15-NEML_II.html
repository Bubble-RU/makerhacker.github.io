<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>6 0.48197567 <a title="481-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-18-7th_Annual_Machine_Learning_Symposium.html">474 hunch net-2012-10-18-7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT
and Lucent for exampl</p><p>5 0.8413052 <a title="481-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-26-Netflix_nearly_done.html">362 hunch net-2009-06-26-Netflix nearly done</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on thepublic Netflix test setby a3-way
ensemble team. This is just in time forYehuda's presentation atKDD, which I'm
sure will be one of the best attended ever.This isn't quite over--there are a
few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is
some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test
set, but I expect not.Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for
ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of
ensemble methods.</p><p>6 0.56215924 <a title="481-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

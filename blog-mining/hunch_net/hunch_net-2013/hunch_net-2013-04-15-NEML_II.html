<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>6 0.14814009 <a title="481-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup a  Mathematics and Computation  Blog.  As a first step he has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.  As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary.  Despite this necessity, every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally clumsy.  Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:
  
  MathML   This was supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: “Internet Explorer” doesn’t read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-limit which no one would ever consider writing in.  (In contrast, html is easy to write in.)  It’s also very annoying that math fonts must be installed independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers. 
 Create inline images.  This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers, you can’t cut & paste inside the images, and you can’t hyperlink from (say) symbol to de</p><p>3 0.492194 <a title="481-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, there was a discussion about  future publication models at NIPS .   Yann  and  Zoubin  have specific detailed proposals which I’ll add links to when I get them ( Yann’s proposal  and  Zoubin’s proposal ).
 
What struck me about the discussion is that there are many simultaneous concerns as well as many simultaneous proposals, which makes it difficult to keep all the distinctions straight in a verbal conversation.  It also seemed like people were serious enough about this that we may see some real movement.  Certainly, my personal experience motivates that as I’ve  posted many times  about the substantial flaws in our review process, including some very poor personal experiences.
 
Concerns include the following:
  
 (Several) Reviewers are overloaded, boosting the noise in decision making. 
 ( Yann ) A new system should run with as little built-in delay and friction to the process of research as possible.

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.
 
Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>6 0.43814927 <a title="481-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

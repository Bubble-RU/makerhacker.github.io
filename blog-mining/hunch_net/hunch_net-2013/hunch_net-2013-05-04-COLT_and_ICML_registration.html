<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive. 
 Tutorials are a good way to gain some understanding of a long-standing direction of research.  They are generally more coherent than workshops.   ICML has 7  and  AAAI has 15 .</p><p>6 0.17308332 <a title="482-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.
 
The conference will take place on 13-15 June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.
 
The website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.html
 
The early registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel rates is May 9.
 
Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM, $18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>3 0.70733798 <a title="482-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-12-ICML_accepted_papers_and_early_registration.html">465 hunch net-2012-05-12-ICML accepted papers and early registration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Maybe it’s too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions at this year’s  ICML ,  it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here are my  highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these  papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.
 
The first observation I made is that the once disreputable “Neural” nomenclature is being used again  in lieu of  “deep learning”. Maybe it’s because Adam Coates et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.

  The Importance of Encoding Versus Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization ,  Adam Coates ,  Andrew Y. Ng  (ICML 2011) 
  
Another surprising result out of Andrew Ng’s group comes from Andrew  Saxe et al. who show that certain convolutional pooling architectures  can obtain close to state-of-the-art pe</p><p>5 0.5210681 <a title="482-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-27-NYAS_ML_2012_and_ICML_2013.html">472 hunch net-2012-08-27-NYAS ML 2012 and ICML 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.
 
Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>6 0.52032173 <a title="482-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

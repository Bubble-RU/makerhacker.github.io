Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over fromJohn

probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for

reviewing decisions atCOLT 2009, one as an author and several as a member of

important work, partly because I'm focused on learning theory with practical
implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is
typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from
insider-clique issues. The degree to which these issues come up varies
substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one. And, it's
important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>6 0.13568971 <a title="482-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-13-%26%238220%3BSister_Conference%26%238221%3B_presentations.html">93 hunch net-2005-07-13-&#8220;Sister Conference&#8221; presentations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.The conference will take place on 13-15
June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing
Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.The
website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.htmlThe early
registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel
rates is May 9.Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially
lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If you've been
contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM,
$18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>4 0.65081584 <a title="482-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-24-COLT_Treasurer_is_now_Phil_Long.html">394 hunch net-2010-04-24-COLT Treasurer is now Phil Long</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereirapoints out a funPrediction Competition. Francisco says:DARPA
is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the
scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the
videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant
with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts,
motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.The
challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant
basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly
interesting:This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably
hard.This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot
deal with.This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and
preprocessed neuroimaging dataset.DARPA is offering prizes!</p><p>4 0.72277528 <a title="482-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-09-The_Machine_Learning_Forum.html">363 hunch net-2009-07-09-The Machine Learning Forum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Fellow Machine Learners,For the past year or so I have become
increasingly frustrated with the peer review system in our field. I constantly
get asked to review papers in which I have no interest. At the same time, as
an action editor in JMLR, I constantly have to harass people to review papers.
When I send papers to conferences and to journals I often get rejected with
reviews that, at least in my mind, make no sense. Finally, I have a very hard
time keeping up with the best new work, because I don't know where to look for
itâ&euro;ŚI decided to try an do something to improve the situation. I started a new
web site, which I decided to call "The machine learning forum" the URL
ishttp://themachinelearningforum.orgThe main idea behind this web site is to
remove anonymity from the review process. In this site, all opinions are
attributed to the actual person that expressed them. I expect that this will
improve the quality of the reviews. An obvious other effect is that there will
be fewer n</p><p>5 0.610753 <a title="482-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-08-Online_Learning_as_the_Mathematics_of_Accountability.html">109 hunch net-2005-09-08-Online Learning as the Mathematics of Accountability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

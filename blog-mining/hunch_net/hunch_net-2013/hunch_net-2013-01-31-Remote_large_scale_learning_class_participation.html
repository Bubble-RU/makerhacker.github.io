What happened: In order to publish 2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service, the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had ignored while removing the data from previous server.
 
What are we doing about this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make sure this does not happen again in future:

<p>Introduction: Yann LeCun  and I are coteaching a class on  Large Scale Machine Learning  starting late January  at NYU .  This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the previous.
 
This is not a beginning class—you really need to have taken a basic machine learning class previously to follow along.  Students will be able to run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms since  Yahoo!  has donated servers which are being configured into a small scale  Hadoop  cluster.   We are planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so good class projects could easily lead to papers.
 
For me, this is a chance to teach on many topics of past research.  In general, it seems like researchers should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of teachability and to see their own research through th</p><p>4 0.12381206 <a title="479-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net.html">240 hunch net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Davor  has been working to setup  videolectures.net  which is the new site for the many lectures  mentioned here .  (Tragically, they seem to only be available in windows media format.) I went through  my own projects  and added a few links to the videos.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, there was a discussion about  future publication models at NIPS .   Yann  and  Zoubin  have specific detailed proposals which I’ll add links to when I get them ( Yann’s proposal  and  Zoubin’s proposal ).
 
What struck me about the discussion is that there are many simultaneous concerns as well as many simultaneous proposals, which makes it difficult to keep all the distinctions straight in a verbal conversation.  It also seemed like people were serious enough about this that we may see some real movement.  Certainly, my personal experience motivates that as I’ve  posted many times  about the substantial flaws in our review process, including some very poor personal experiences.
 
Concerns include the following:
  
 (Several) Reviewers are overloaded, boosting the noise in decision making. 
 ( Yann ) A new system should run with as little built-in delay and friction to the process of research as possible.

<p>Introduction: The  large scale machine learning class  I taught with  Yann LeCun  has finished.  As I expected, it took quite a bit of time   .  We had about 25 people attending in person on average and 400 regularly watching the  recorded lectures  which is substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML class.  We also had some fun with class projects—I’m hopeful that several will eventually turn into papers.
 
I expect there are a number of professors interested in lecturing on this and related topics.  Everyone will have their personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some convergence to common course materials as well.  To help with this, I am making the  sources to my presentations available .

<p>Introduction: Yann and I have arranged so that people who are interested in our  large scale machine learning class  and not able to attend in person can follow along via two methods.
  
  Videos  will be posted with about a 1 day delay on  techtalks .  This is a side-by-side capture of video+slides from  Weyond . 
 We are experimenting with  Piazza  as a discussion forum.  Anyone is welcome to subscribe to Piazza and ask questions there, where I will be monitoring things.   update2 : Sign up  here . 
  
The first lecture is up now, including the  revised version of the slides  which fixes a few typos and rounds out references.</p><p>2 0.92746866 <a title="479-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>3 0.91790146 <a title="479-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>4 0.86190802 <a title="479-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Makc asked a good  question  in comments—”Why bother to make a paper, at all?”  There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately obvious to people not in academia.
 
The basic idea is that papers have considerably more utility than the obvious “present an idea”.
  
 Papers are a formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged on the number of papers they produce. 
 Papers have a formalized method of citing and crediting other—the bibliography.  Academics (especially older ones) are often judged on the number of citations they receive. 
 Papers enable a “more fair” anonymous review.  Conferences receive  many  papers, from which a subset are selected.  Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants to build a reputation for good work. 
 Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.  Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to friends about interesting problems while there.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.75900966 <a title="479-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>

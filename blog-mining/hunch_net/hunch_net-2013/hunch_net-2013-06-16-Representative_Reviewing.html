</p><p>2 When reviewer/paper assignment is automated based on an affinity graph, the affinity graph may be low quality or the constraint on the maximum number of papers per reviewer can easily leave some papers with low affinity to all reviewers orphaned. [sent-17, score-1.999]
</p><p>3 I've seen this happen at the beginning of the reviewing process, but the more insidious case is when it happens at the end, where people are pressed for time and low quality judgements can become common. [sent-19, score-0.77]
</p><p>4 ForICML, there are about 3 levels of "reviewer": the program chair who is responsible for all papers, the area chair who is responsible for organizing reviewing on a subset of papers, and the program committee member/reviewer who has primary responsibility for reviewing. [sent-22, score-1.177]
</p><p>5 We used a constraint system to assign the first reviewer to each paper and two area chairs to each paper. [sent-25, score-0.814]
</p><p>6 Then, we asked each area chair to find one reviewer for each paper. [sent-26, score-0.604]
</p><p>7 This does not happen in the standard review process, because the reviews of others are not visible to other reviewers until they are complete. [sent-34, score-0.605]
</p><p>8 A more subtle form of bias is when one reviewer is simply much louder or charismatic than others. [sent-35, score-0.522]
</p><p>9 A primary issue here is time: most reviewers will submit a review within a time constraint, but it may not be high quality due to limits on time. [sent-38, score-0.653]
</p><p>10 Making reviewers not anonymous to each other helps with motivation as poor reviews will at least be known to some. [sent-44, score-0.566]
</p><p>11 A third form of low quality review is based on miscommunication. [sent-47, score-0.647]
</p><p>12 Sometimes this comes in the form of giving each area chair a budget of papers to "champion". [sent-52, score-0.52]
</p><p>13 Sometimes this comes in the form of an area chair deciding to override all reviews and either accept or more likely reject a paper. [sent-53, score-0.599]
</p><p>14 If the reviewers disgreed, we asked the two area chairs to make decisions and if they agreed, that was the decision. [sent-58, score-0.521]
</p><p>15 Overall, I think it's a significant long term positive for a conference as "insiders" naturally become more concerned with review quality and "outsiders" are more prone to submit. [sent-64, score-0.484]
</p><p>16 This improves review quality by placing a check on unfair reviews and reducing miscommunication at some cost in time. [sent-68, score-0.665]
</p><p>17 This allows authors to better communicate complex ideas, at the potential cost of reviewer time. [sent-70, score-0.524]
</p><p>18 These approaches can be accommodated by simply hiding authors names for a fixed period of 2 months while the initial review process is ongoing. [sent-76, score-0.631]
</p><p>19 If a paper is rejected in a representative reviewing process, then perhaps it is just not of sufficient interest. [sent-78, score-0.466]
</p><p>20 And if the reviewing process is not representative, then perhaps we should fix the failure modes. [sent-80, score-0.468]

<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to
fail:Give early w</p><p>4 0.36755455 <a title="484-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-13-Avoiding_Bad_Reviewing.html">40 hunch net-2005-03-13-Avoiding Bad Reviewing</a></p>

Analysis, and ExperimentsAs far as I know, the essence of the more general
problem was first stated and analyzed with theEXP4 algorithm (page 16)(1998).
It's also the time horizon 1 simplification of the Reinforcement Learning

algorithm itself is functionally identical toOne-Step RL with Traces (page

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>4 0.8877719 <a title="484-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>2 0.94125938 <a title="484-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-13-What_to_do_with_an_unreasonable_conditional_accept.html">238 hunch net-2007-04-13-What to do with an unreasonable conditional accept</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last year about this time, we received a conditional accept for thesearn
paper, which asked us to reference a paper that was not reasonable to cite
because there was strictly more relevant work by the same authors that we
already cited. We wrote a response explaining this, and didn't cite it in the
final draft, giving the SPC an excuse toreject the paper, leading to
unhappiness for all.Later,Sanjoy Dasguptasuggested that an alternative was to
talk to the PC chair instead, as soon as you see that a conditional accept is
unreasonable.William Cohenand I spoke about this by email, the relevant bit of
which is:If an SPC asks for a revision that is inappropriate, the
correctaction is to contact the chairs as soon as the decision is made,clearly
explaining what the problem is, so we can decide whether ornot to over-rule
the SPC. As you say, this is extra work for uschairs, but that's part of the
job, and we're willing to do that sortof work to improve the overall quality

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>4 0.89734519 <a title="484-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-02-ICML%3A_Behind_the_Scenes.html">463 hunch net-2012-05-02-ICML: Behind the Scenes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal
is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came
to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for
future conference organizers.Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)We
chose to useCMTover other conference management software mainly because of its
rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has
extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.),
good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent
technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).
Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at
that interface sometime soon!Toronto Matching System (TMS)TMSis now being used
by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.88228083 <a title="484-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>

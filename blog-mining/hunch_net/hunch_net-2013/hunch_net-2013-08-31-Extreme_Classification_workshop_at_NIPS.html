<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.Barriers in Computational Learning
Theory Workshop, Aug 28.That's tomorrow near Princeton. I'm looking forward to
speaking at this one on "Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory", but
several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory
inclined.Claudia Perlichis running theINFORMS Data Mining Contestwith a
deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they
partnered withHealthCare Intelligence) to predict transfers and mortality. In
the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we
hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions.The
Singularity Summit October 3&4\. This is for the AIists out there. Several of
the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I'll miss it
forALT.Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21. This is stretching the
definition of "New York Area" a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable. This
is a conference of case studies</p><p>5 0.14052728 <a title="488-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.1387457 <a title="488-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Attendance at theNIPS workshopsis highly recommended for both research and
learning. Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of
workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of
interest:Machine Learning in FinanceLearning to RankFoundations of Active
LearningMachine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured EnvironmentsThere
aremanymore workshops. In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible
anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in. Maybe in future years
the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap.Many of
these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>4 0.5492878 <a title="488-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There are very substantial differences in how question asking is viewed
culturally. For example, all of the following are common:If no one asks a
question, then no one is paying attention.To ask a question is disrespectful
of the speaker.Asking a question is admitting your own ignorance.The first
view seems to be the right one for research, for several reasons.Research is
quite hard--it's difficult to guess how people won't understand something in
advance while preparing a presentation. Consequently, it's very common to lose
people. No worthwhile presenter wants that.Real understanding is precious. By
asking a question, you are really declaring "I want to understand", and
everyone should respect that.Asking a question wakes you up. I don't mean from
"asleep" to "awake" but from "awake" to "really awake". It's easy to drift
through something sort-of-understanding. When you ask a question, especially
because you are on the spot, you will do much better.Some of these effects
might seem mi</p><p>3 0.75115579 <a title="488-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-01-Multitask_Poisoning.html">358 hunch net-2009-06-01-Multitask Poisoning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done. For example it's
common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial
solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting
in a paper. In some sense, these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we
should ask: Can all research be this easy?The answer is certainly no for
fields where research inherently requires experimentation to discover how the
real world works. However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer
science, statistics, etcâ&euro;Ś which are effectively mathematics don't require
experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of
thinking. Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?What's going on
here is research-by-communication. Someone knows something, someone knows
something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.
The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>5 0.63292611 <a title="488-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-27-Reviewing_Horror_Stories.html">304 hunch net-2008-06-27-Reviewing Horror Stories</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>6 0.6321069 <a title="488-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

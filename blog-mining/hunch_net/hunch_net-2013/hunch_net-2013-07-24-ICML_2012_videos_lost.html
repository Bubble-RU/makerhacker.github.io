<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereira  points out a fun  Prediction Competition .   Francisco says:
 
DARPA is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts, motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.
 
The challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly interesting:
  
  This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably hard. 
  This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot deal with. 
  This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and preprocessed neuroimaging dataset.

<p>Introduction: A big ouch—all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle.  Rajnish sends the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
 
——————————————————————————
 
Sincere apologies to ICML community for loosing 2012 archived videos
 
What happened: In order to publish 2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service, the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had ignored while removing the data from previous server.
 
What are we doing about this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make sure this does not happen again in future: 
(1) We are going to create a channel on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p- or slide-vers</p><p>2 0.86887521 <a title="487-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize.html">402 hunch net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron. 
 We may not need to simulate a human brain to achieve AI.  Ther</p><p>4 0.76154977 <a title="487-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-14-NIPS_workshp%3A_Learning_Problem_Design.html">265 hunch net-2007-10-14-NIPS workshp: Learning Problem Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alina  and I are organizing a workshop on  Learning Problem Design  at  NIPS .  
 
 What is learning problem design?  Itâ&euro;&trade;s about being clever in creating learning problems from otherwise unlabeled data.  Read the webpage above for examples.
 
 I want to participate!  Email us before Nov. 1 with a description of what you want to talk about.</p><p>5 0.53913301 <a title="487-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-30-NIPS_workshops_are_out..html">264 hunch net-2007-09-30-NIPS workshops are out.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here .  Iâ&euro;&trade;m particularly interested in the  Web Search ,  Efficient ML , and (of course)  Learning Problem Design  workshops but there are many others to check out as well. Workshops are a great chance to make progress on or learn about a topic.

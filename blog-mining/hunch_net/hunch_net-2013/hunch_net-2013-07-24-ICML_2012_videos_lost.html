dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.Machine Learning conferences
are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current
candidate a spring symposium on March 28.Gunnarand I were outvoted here--we
were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee
wants to wait.In some good news, most of theICML 2012 videoshave been restored

<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:Updating
toWordPress1.5.Installing and heavily tweaking theGeeknichetheme. Update: I
switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme.Adding theCustomizable
Post Listingsplugin.Installing theStatTraqplugin.Updating some of the links. I
particularly recommend looking at thecomputer research
policyblog.Addingthreaded comments. This doesn't thread old comments
obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones.Overall, I
think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of myearlier problems. If
you have any difficulties or anything seems "not quite right", please speak
up. A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>6 0.45144102 <a title="487-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-17-Server_Update.html">354 hunch net-2009-05-17-Server Update</a></p>

current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service,
the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had
ignored while removing the data from previous server.What are we doing about
this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can
retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make
sure this does not happen again in future:(1) We are going to create a channel
on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p-</p><p>2 0.68283248 <a title="487-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-05-%26%238220%3BStructural%26%238221%3B_Learning.html">161 hunch net-2006-03-05-&#8220;Structural&#8221; Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fernando Pereirapointed outAndo andZhang'spaperon "structural" learning.
Structural learning is multitask learning on subproblems created from
unlabeled data.The basic idea is to take a look at the unlabeled data and
create many supervised problems. On text data, which they test on, these
subproblems might be of the form "Given surrounding words predict the middle
word". The hope here is that successfully predicting on these subproblems is
relevant to the prediction of your core problem.In the long run, the precise
mechanism used (essentially, linear predictors with parameters tied by a
common matrix) and the precise problems formed may not be critical. What seems
critical is that the hope is realized: the technique provides a significant
edge in practice.Some basic questions about this approach are:Are there
effective automated mechanisms for creating the subproblems?Is it necessary to
use a shared representation?</p><p>3 0.37226772 <a title="487-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-15-ESPgame_and_image_labeling.html">20 hunch net-2005-02-15-ESPgame and image labeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahnhas been running theespgamefor awhile now. The espgame provides a
picture to two randomly paired people across the web, and asks them to agree
on a label. It hasn't managed to label the web yet, but it has produced alarge
datasetof (image, label) pairs. I organized the dataset so you couldexplore
the implied bipartite graph(requires much bandwidth).Relative to other image
datasets, this one is quite large--67000 images, 358,000 labels (average of
5/image with variation from 1 to 19), and 22,000 unique labels (one every 3
images). The dataset is also very 'natural', consisting of images spidered
from the internet. The multiple label characteristic is intriguing because
'learning to learn' and metalearning techniques may be applicable. The
'natural' quality means that this dataset varies greatly in difficulty from
easy (predicting "red") to hard (predicting "funny") and potentially more
rewarding to tackle.The open problem here is, of course, to make an internet

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>5 0.28787115 <a title="487-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AtKDDI enjoyedStephen Boyd's invited talk about optimization quite a bit.
However, the most interesting talk for me wasDavid Haussler's. His talk
started out with a formidable load of biological complexity. About half-way
through you start wondering, "can this be used to help with cancer?" And at
the end he connects it directly to use with a call to arms for the audience:
cure cancer. The core thesis here is that cancer is a complex set of diseases
which can be distentangled via genetic assays, allowing attacking the specific
signature of individual cancers. However, the data quantity and complex
dependencies within the data require systematic and relatively automatic
prediction and analysis algorithms of the kind that we are best familiar
with.Some of the papers which interested me are:Kai-Wei ChangandDan
Roth,Selective Block Minimization for Faster Convergence of Limited Memory
Large-Scale Linear Models, which is about effectively using a hard-example
cache to speedup learning.Leland</p><p>6 0.2852512 <a title="487-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-09-ICML_author_feedback_is_open.html">461 hunch net-2012-04-09-ICML author feedback is open</a></p>

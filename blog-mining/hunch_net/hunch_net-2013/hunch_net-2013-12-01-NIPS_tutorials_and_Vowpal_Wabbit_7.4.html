<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to
handle several large family loss functions.This is a good thing because it is
implausible that thelossfunction imposed by the world can not be taken into
account in the process of solving a prediction problem. Even people used to
the hard-coreBayesianapproach to learning often note that some approximations
are almost inevitable in specifying apriorand/or integrating to achieve a
posterior. Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both
computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve
performance.A current laundry list of capabilities includes:2002multiclass SVM
including arbitrary cost matricesICML 2003Hidden Markov ModelsNIPS 2003Markov

<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for thereductions
tutorialAlina,Bianca, and I are planning to do atICML. Please come, if you are
interested.Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building
new useful abstractions. The running example I'll use islearning
reductionswhere I have experience. The basic abstraction here is that we can
build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a
small expected regret. This is used repeatedly to solve more complex
problems.In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many
substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly
difficult.It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism
for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits. People rarely
see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new
abstractions. Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, you
often don't know the right way to</p><p>6 0.13426788 <a title="492-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-13-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_6.1_%26%23038%3B_the_NIPS_tutorial.html">451 hunch net-2011-12-13-Vowpal Wabbit version 6.1 &#038; the NIPS tutorial</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm releasingversion 4.0(tarball) ofVowpal Wabbit. The biggest change (by far)
in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable
help fromDaniel Hsu.I also took advantage of the major version number to
introduce some incompatible changes, including switching tomurmurhash 2, and
other alterations to cachefiles. You'll need to delete and regenerate them. In
addition, the precise specification for a "tag" (i.e. string that can be used
to identify an example) changed--you can't have a space between the tag and
the '|' at the beginning of the feature namespace.And, of course, we made it
faster.For the future, I put up mytodo listoutlining the major future
improvements I want to see in the code. I'm planning to discuss the current
mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at thelarge scale
machine learning workshopatNIPSlater this week. Several people have asked me
to do a tutorial/walkthrough of VW, which is arranged for friday 2pm in the
works</p><p>4 0.67815161 <a title="492-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-20-The_Large_Scale_Learning_Survey_Tutorial.html">442 hunch net-2011-08-20-The Large Scale Learning Survey Tutorial</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just madeversion 6.1ofVowpal Wabbit. Relative to6.0, there are few new
features, but many refinements.The cluster parallel learning code better
supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been
mostly removed. This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning
core.The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l1(via
a truncated gradient variant) and l2regularization, and a generalized form of
variable metric learning.There is a solid persistent server mode which can
train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in
text or binary.This should be a very good release if you are just getting
started, as we've made it compile more automatically out of the box, have
several newexamplesand updated documentation.Aspertradition, we're planning to
do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at theparallel learning workshopat 2pm
Spanish time Friday. I'll cover the basics, leaving the fun stuff for
others.Mirowill cov</p><p>6 0.60875678 <a title="492-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-18-SVM_Adaptability.html">103 hunch net-2005-08-18-SVM Adaptability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Apparently, the companySpockis setting up a$50k entity resolution challenge.
$50k is much less than the Netflix challenge, but it's effectively the same as
Netflix untilsomeone reaches 10%. It's also nice that the Spock challenge has
a short duration. The (visible) test set is of size 25k and the training set
has size 75k.</p><p>2 0.91203088 <a title="492-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-09-A_Healthy__COLT.html">324 hunch net-2008-11-09-A Healthy  COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Awhile ago, we discussed the health ofCOLT.COLT 2008substantially addressed my
concerns. The papers were diverse and several were interesting. Attendance was
up, which is particularly notable in Europe. In my opinion, the colocation
with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.And, perhaps best of all,
registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from
theAcademy of Finland,Google,IBM, andYahoo.A basic question is: what went
right? There seem to be several answers.Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants
to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university
substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel.Organization-wise, the
Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up. Having
too many volunteers is a good failure mode.Organization-wise, it was clear
that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program
.Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made the colocation much more
real than many others</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87060469 <a title="492-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-12-01-NIPS_tutorials_and_Vowpal_Wabbit_7.4.html">492 hunch net-2013-12-01-NIPS tutorials and Vowpal Wabbit 7.4</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At NIPS I'm giving atutorial on Learning to Interact. In essence this is about
dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious
tutorials, I'll be covering several new results that changed my understanding
of the nature of the problem. Note thatJudea PearlandElias Bareinboimhave
atutorial on causality. This might appear similar, but is quite different in
practice. Pearl and Bareinboim's tutorial will be about the general concepts
while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,
including code. Luckily, they have the right order. I recommend going to bothI
also just released version 7.4 ofVowpal Wabbit. When I was a frustrated
learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and
addressing the issues. One of the issues is that machine learning itself was
not automatic enough, while another is that creating a very low overhead

<p>Introduction: Hal,Daniel, and I have been working on the algorithmSearnfor structured
prediction. This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML,
and we were quite surprised. By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an
interesting algorithm.Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any
other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature
set. This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their
papers.Theoretical underpinning. Searn is a reduction which comes with a
reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good
performance for the overall system. No other theorem of this type has been
made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know.Speed.
Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we
tested against.Simplicity. Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-
specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to implement
Searn.Generality.</p><p>5 0.75603974 <a title="492-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>6 0.75518739 <a title="492-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>

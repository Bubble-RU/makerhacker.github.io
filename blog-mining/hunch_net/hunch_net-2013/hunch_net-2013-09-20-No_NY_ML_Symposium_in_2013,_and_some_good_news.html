<p>Introduction: The 201314 isNew York Machine Learning Symposiumis finally happening on March
28th at theNew York Academy of Science. Every invited speaker interests me
personally. They are:Rayid Ghani(Chief Scientist at Obama 2012)Brian
Kingsbury(Speech Recognition @ IBM)Jorge Nocedal(who did LBFGS)We've been
somewhat disorganized in advertising this. As a consequence, anyone who has
not submitted an abstract but would like to do so may send one directly to me
(jl@hunch.net title NYASMLS) by Friday March 14. I will forward them to the
rest of the committee for consideration.</p><p>4 0.1356827 <a title="489-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.12539551 <a title="489-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

speaking at this one on "Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory", but
several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory
inclined.Claudia Perlichis running theINFORMS Data Mining Contestwith a
deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they
partnered withHealthCare Intelligence) to predict transfers and mortality. In
the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we
hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions.The
Singularity Summit October 3&4\. This is for the AIists out there. Several of
the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I'll miss it
forALT.Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21. This is stretching the

<p>Introduction: AtICML 2003,Marty Zinkevichproposedthe online convex optimization setting and
showed that a particular gradient descent algorithm has regret O(T0.5) with
respect to the best predictor where T is the number of rounds. This seems to
be a nice model for online learning, and there has been some significant
follow-up work.AtCOLT 2006Elad Hazan,Adam Kalai,Satyen Kale, andAmit
Agarwalpresenteda modification which takes a Newton stepguaranteeing O(log T)
regret when the first and second derivatives are bounded.Then they applied
these algorithms to portfolio managementatICML 2006(withRobert Schapire)
yielding some very fun graphs.</p><p>3 0.80684239 <a title="489-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-04-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_5.0%2C_and_the_second_heresy.html">419 hunch net-2010-12-04-Vowpal Wabbit, version 5.0, and the second heresy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>4 0.78596872 <a title="489-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>5 0.76476657 <a title="489-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "boosting" comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes
"weak" learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than
random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very
well).Adaboostin 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting
algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around
since 1990 (see the bottom ofthis page).Since then, many different
interpretations of why boosting works have arisen. There is significant
discussion about these different views in theannals of statistics, including
aresponsebyYoav FreundandRobert Schapire.I believe there is a great deal of
value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for
creating a strong learner from a weak learner). This is not a claim that one
particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no
other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.Comparing with
all other views of boosting is t</p><p>6 0.69363731 <a title="489-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-13-Wikis_for_Summer_Schools_and_Workshops.html">81 hunch net-2005-06-13-Wikis for Summer Schools and Workshops</a></p>

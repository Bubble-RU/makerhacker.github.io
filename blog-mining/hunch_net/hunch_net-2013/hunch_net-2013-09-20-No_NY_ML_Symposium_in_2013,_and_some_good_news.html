<p>Introduction: The 20 13 14 is  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is finally happening on March 28th at the  New York Academy of Science .  Every invited speaker interests me personally.  They are:
  
  Rayid Ghani  (Chief Scientist at Obama 2012) 
  Brian Kingsbury  (Speech Recognition @ IBM) 
  Jorge Nocedal  (who did LBFGS)

<p>Introduction: A big ouch—all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle.  Rajnish sends the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
 
——————————————————————————
 
Sincere apologies to ICML community for loosing 2012 archived videos
 
What happened: In order to publish 2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service, the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had ignored while removing the data from previous server.
 
What are we doing about this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make sure this does not happen again in future: 
(1) We are going to create a channel on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p- or slide-vers</p><p>4 0.19418615 <a title="489-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>5 0.15908052 <a title="489-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-24-David_Waltz.html">460 hunch net-2012-03-24-David Waltz</a></p>
<p>Introduction: has  died .   He lived a full life.  I know him personally as a founder of the  Center for Computational Learning Systems  and the  New York Machine Learning Symposium , both of which have sheltered and promoted the advancement of machine learning.

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>4 0.62080991 <a title="489-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).

<p>Introduction: A  while ago , we discussed the health of  COLT .   COLT 2008  substantially addressed my concerns.  The papers were diverse and several were interesting.  Attendance was up, which is particularly notable in Europe.  In my opinion, the colocation with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.
 
And, perhaps best of all, registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from the  Academy of Finland ,  Google ,  IBM , and  Yahoo .
 
A basic question is: what went right?  There seem to be several answers.
  
 Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel. 
 Organization-wise, the Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up.  Having too many volunteers is a good failure mode. 
 Organization-wise, it was clear that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program.

<p>Introduction: Much of the success and popularity of machine learning has been driven by its practical impact. Of course, the evaluation of empirical work is an integral part of the field. But are the existing mechanisms for evaluating algorithms and comparing results good enough? We ( Percy  and  Jake ) believe there are currently a number of shortcomings:  

  
  Incomplete Disclosure:  You read a paper that proposes Algorithm A which is shown to outperform SVMs on two datasets.  Great.  But what about on other datasets?  How sensitive is this result?   What about compute time – does the algorithm take two seconds on a laptop or two weeks on a 100-node cluster? 
  Lack of Standardization:  Algorithm A beats Algorithm B on one version of a dataset.  Algorithm B beats Algorithm A on another version yet uses slightly different preprocessing.  Though doing a head-on comparison would be ideal, it would be tedious since the programs probably use different dataset formats and have a large array of options</p><p>4 0.45714068 <a title="489-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-07-Interesting_Papers_at_SODA_2009.html">334 hunch net-2009-01-07-Interesting Papers at SODA 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year’s SODA.
  
  Maria-Florina Balcan ,  Avrim Blum , and  Anupam Gupta ,  Approximate Clustering without the Approximation .  This paper gives reasonable algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of clustering.  It’s conceptually interesting, because it’s the second example I’ve seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition subtle but reasonable way.  Essentially, they show that if any near-approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it’s computationally easy to find a near-optimal solution.  This subtle shift bears serious thought.  A similar one occurred in  our ranking paper  with respect to minimum feedback arcset.  With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.

<p>Introduction: The term “boosting” comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes “weak” learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very well).    Adaboost  in 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around since 1990 (see the bottom of  this page ).
 
Since then, many different interpretations of why boosting works have arisen.  There is significant discussion about these different views in the  annals of statistics , including a  response  by  Yoav Freund  and  Robert Schapire .
 
I believe there is a great deal of value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for creating a strong learner from a weak learner).  This is not a claim that one particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.

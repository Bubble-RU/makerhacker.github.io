<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple.  Viewed representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural networks or kernelized SVMs).  Should we go beyond this, and start using “deep” representations?
 
 What is deep learning?  
Intuitively, deep learning is about learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the input (observed) features.
 
Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be rather difficult.  Consider the following cases:
  
 SVM with Gaussian Kernel.  This is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can’t succinctly represent certain decision surfaces.  One of  Yann LeCun ‘s examples is recognizing objects based on pixel values.  An SVM will need a new support vector for each significantly different background.  Since the number</p><p>3 0.14211453 <a title="477-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-23-Boosted_Decision_Trees_for_Deep_Learning.html">407 hunch net-2010-08-23-Boosted Decision Trees for Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated that  decision trees qualify as a deep learning algorithm  because they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in the input representation.   Ping Li  has  proved this correct, empirically  at  UAI  by showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions of  Mnist  which are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by deep learning algorithms.  
 
This is an important point, because the ability to solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a deep learning algorithm we have.   Iâ&euro;&trade;m not that surprised.  In my experience, if you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they can achieve pretty good performance.
 
 Geoff Hinton  once told me that the great thing about deep belief networks is that they work.  I understand that Ping had very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some reviewers step up to the standard of valuing wha</p><p>4 0.11305062 <a title="477-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-19-Second_Annual_Reinforcement_Learning_Competition.html">268 hunch net-2007-10-19-Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition is about to get started.  The aim of the competition is to facilitate direct comparisons between various learning methods on important and realistic domains.  This yearâ&euro;&trade;s event will feature well-known benchmark domains as well as more challenging problems of real-world complexity, such as helicopter control and robot soccer keepaway.
 
The competition begins on November 1st, 2007 when training software is released.   Results must be submitted by July 1st, 2008.  The competition will culminate in an event at ICML-08 in Helsinki, Finland, at which the winners will be announced.

<p>Introduction: “Deep learning” is used to describe learning architectures which have significant depth (as a circuit).  
 
 One claim  is that shallow architectures (one or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with more depth can concisely represent these same functions.  Proving lower bounds on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are constructive), but some results are known.   Luca Trevisan ‘s  class notes  detail how XOR is not concisely representable by “AC0″ (= constant depth unbounded fan-in AND, OR, NOT gates).  This doesn’t quite prove that depth is necessary for the representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.
 
Examples like this are a bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees depending on who you ask) can’t learn XOR very easily.</p><p>6 0.099001467 <a title="477-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-17-What_does_Watson_mean%3F.html">424 hunch net-2011-02-17-What does Watson mean?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers that I found surprisingly interesting.
  
  Yoshua Bengio , Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici, Hugo Larochelle,  Greedy Layer-wise Training of Deep Networks . Empirically investigates some of the design choices behind deep belief networks.
 
  Long Zhu , Yuanhao Chen,  Alan Yuille  Unsupervised Learning of a Probabilistic Grammar for Object Detection and Parsing.  An unsupervised method for detecting objects using simple feature filters that works remarkably well on the (supervised)  caltech-101 dataset . 
  Shai Ben-David ,  John Blitzer ,  Koby Crammer , and  Fernando Pereira ,  Analysis of Representations for Domain Adaptation .  This is the first analysis I’ve seen of learning with respect to samples drawn differently from the evaluation distribution which depends on reasonable measurable quantities. 
  
All of these papers turn out to have a common theme—the power of unlabeled data to do generically useful things.</p><p>5 0.59716445 <a title="477-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-18-A_paper_not_at_Snowbird.html">431 hunch net-2011-04-18-A paper not at Snowbird</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all of  AIStat  and most of the  learning workshop , otherwise known as Snowbird, when it’s at  Snowbird .  
 
At snowbird, the talk on  Sum-Product  networks by  Hoifung Poon  stood out to me ( Pedro Domingos  is a coauthor.).  The basic point was that by appropriately constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible representation+learning algorithm.  As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster and working better on an image completion task.
 
Snowbird doesn’t have real papers—just the abstract above.  I look forward to seeing the paper.

This is a rare event in research: a significant capability breakout.  Congratulations are definitely in order for those who managed to achieve it.  At this point, deep learning algorithms seem like a choice undeniably worth investigating for real applications with significant data.</p><p>2 0.86280352 <a title="477-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-08-Fast_SVMs.html">54 hunch net-2005-04-08-Fast SVMs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There was a  presentation at snowbird  about parallelized support vector machines.  In many cases, people parallelize by ignoring serial operations, but that is not what happened hereâ&euro;&rdquo;they parallelize with optimizations.  Consequently, this seems to be the fastest SVM in existence.

<p>Introduction: We are releasing the  Vowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) code  as open source under a BSD (revised) license.  This is a  project at Yahoo! Research  to build a useful large scale learning algorithm which  Lihong Li ,  Alex Strehl , and I have been working on.
 
To appreciate the meaning of “large”, it’s useful to define “small” and “medium”.  A “small” supervised learning problem is one where a human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor.  A “medium” supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern desktop computer.  A “large” supervised learning problem is one which does not fit into the RAM of a normal machine.  VW tackles large scale learning problems by this definition of large.  I’m not aware of any other open source Machine Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist).  A few close ones are:
  
  IBM’s Parallel Machine Learning Toolbox   isn’t quite open source .  The approach used by this toolbox is essenti</p><p>5 0.42042303 <a title="477-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-12-04-Structural_Problems_in_NIPS_Decision_Making.html">221 hunch net-2006-12-04-Structural Problems in NIPS Decision Making</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially touchy subject.  Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought about carefully.
 
There are a few things which should be understood:
  
 The system is changing and responsive.  We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC, and even we-the-NIPS-board.  NIPS has implemented ‘secondary program chairs’, ‘author response’, and ‘double blind reviewing’ in the last few years to help with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future. 
 Agreement creates a perception of correctness.  When any PC meets and makes a group decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness.  For the many people who have been on the NIPS PC it’s reasonable to entertain a healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.

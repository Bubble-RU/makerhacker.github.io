<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique
sites p</p><p>5 0.28333601 <a title="486-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

be of wider interest.</p><p>6 0.25290009 <a title="486-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a
problem, letting the world know is helpful. This isn't necessarily because the
world will help you s</p><p>6 0.45016927 <a title="486-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-02-Retrospective.html">225 hunch net-2007-01-02-Retrospective</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the article aboutscience using modern tools interesting, especially
the part about 'blogophobia', which in my experience is often a substantial
issue: many potential guest posters aren't quite ready, because of the fear of
a permanent public mistake, because it is particularly hard to write about the
unknown (the essence of research), and because the system for public credit
doesn't yet really handle blog posts.So far, science has been relatively
resistant to discussing research on blogs. Some things need to change to get
there. Public tolerance of the occasional mistake is essential, as is a
willingness to cite (and credit) blogs as freely as papers.I've often run into
another reason for holding back myself: I don't want to overtalk my own
research. Nevertheless, I'm slowly changing to the opinion that I'm holding
back too much: the real power of a blog in research is that it can be used to
confer with many people, and that just makes research work better.</p><p>4 0.37463942 <a title="486-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-26-Another_10-year_paper_in_Machine_Learning.html">368 hunch net-2009-08-26-Another 10-year paper in Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was thinking about the best "10 year paper" forICML, I also took a look
at a few other conferences. Here is one from 10 years ago that interested
me:David McAllesterPAC-Bayesian Model Averaging,COLT1999.2001 Journal
Draft.Prior to this paper, the only mechanism known for controlling or
estimating the necessary sample complexity for learning over continuously
parameterized predictors was VC theory and variants, all of which suffered
from a basic problem: they were incredibly pessimistic in practice. This meant
that only very gross guidance could be provided for learning algorithm design.
The PAC-Bayes bound provided an alternative approach to sample complexity
bounds which was radically tighter, quantitatively. It also imported and
explained many of the motivations for Bayesian learning in a way that learning
theory and perhaps optimization people might appreciate. Since this paper came
out, there have been a number of moderately successful attempts to drive
algorithms directly b</p><p>5 0.27363104 <a title="486-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own
experience is that a basic attitude of "no child unrealized" is better than
"no child lef</p><p>6 0.24598359 <a title="486-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>3 0.13673522 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-23-Migrating_data_from_a_SQL_database_to_Hadoop.html">11 nathan marz storm-2010-03-23-Migrating data from a SQL database to Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We did a fun post on the BackType blog today analyzing a meme that took off on
Twitter this week. A person with about 500 followers started the meme that
eventually reached more than 27 million people. Check out our analysishere,
and you can check out TechCrunch coverage of our analysishere.Doing the
analysis was relatively simple. We extracted an 80 MB dataset of the tweets
involved in the meme from our 25 TB social dataset. We downloaded that data to
a local computer and ran queries on the data from a Clojure REPL
usingCascalog. Doing the data analysis only took us a couple hours.</p><p>5 0.079176225 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-03-29-My_talks_at_POSSCON.html">30 nathan marz storm-2011-03-29-My talks at POSSCON</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week I went to POSSCON in Columbia, South Carolina. It was an interesting
experience and a good reminder that not everyone in the world thinks like we
do in Silicon Valley.I gave two talks at the conference. One was a technical
talk about how to build realtime Big Data systems, and the other was a non-
technical talk about the things we do at BackType to be a super-productive
team. Both slide decks are embedded below.The Secrets of Building Realtime Big

<p>Introduction: Spencer Fry wrote agreat poston "Why entrepreneurs should write." I would
further add that the benefits of writing are so extraordinary that you should
write a blog even if you have no readers (and regardless of whether you're an
entrepreneur).I have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some of them are just a few
ideas scribbled down arguing with myself. Most of them will never be
published, yet I got value out of writing all of them.Writing makes you a
better readerBlogging has changed how I read other people's writing.In
struggling to find the right ways to structure and present my posts, I am much
more attuned to what makes a good argument and what makes a bad argument. I am
better at seeing holes in other people's reasoning.At the same time, when
reading I am less likely to fall into the trap of discrediting a post with
weak counterclaims. In most any post, there are likely to be counterclaims
that are based onexceptional cases. Internet commenters love to point these
out. However, these ex</p><p>6 0.087319873 <a title="5-lsi-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-03-29-My_talks_at_POSSCON.html">30 nathan marz storm-2011-03-29-My talks at POSSCON</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I wish I had known this a year ago. Now, with some simple mathematics I can
finally answer:Why doesn't the speed of my workflow double when I double the
amount of processing power?Why does a 10% failure rate cause my runtime to go
up by 300%?How does optimizing out 30% of my workflow runtime cause the
runtime to decrease by 80%?How many machines should I have in my cluster to be
adequately performant and fault-tolerant?All of these questions are neatly
answered by one simple equation:Runtime = Overhead / (1 - {Time to process one
hour of data})We will derive this equation in a moment. First, let's briefly
discuss what I mean by "Hadoop-based system."1A common use-case of Hadoop is
running a workflow that processes a continuous stream of incoming data. The
workflow runs in a "while(true)" loop, and each iteration of the workflow
processes the data that accumulated since last iteration.The inspiration for
the following analysis can be summarized in a simple example. Let's say you

<p>Introduction: Here's a few tips for optimizing your Cascading flows. I also recommend
checking out"7 Tips for Improving MapReduce Performance"for general MapReduce
optimization tips.1. Filter data as early as possibleLess data equals less
work. Sometimes you can easily filter data out early by moving filters earlier
in your flow. Other times, it can be more complicated.One important use case
that can be heavily optimized is querying a set of records for matches against
a large set of keys - also known as abatch query. You can read more about the
mechanics of batch querieshere. You can find the source code for batch
queryinghere. The implementation utilizes a bloom filter to filter data out of
the flow before using a join to complete the logic for the query.Another wide-
range of use cases involves keeping data in memory within each task for
querying. For example, let's say you have a bunch of key-value pairs in HDFS,
and you want all the pairs where the keydoes notbelong in a separate list of

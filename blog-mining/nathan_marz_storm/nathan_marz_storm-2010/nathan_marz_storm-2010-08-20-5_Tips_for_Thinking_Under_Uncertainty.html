<p>Introduction: This is the first in a series of posts on the principles of software
engineering. There's far more to software engineering than just "making
computers do stuff" – while that phrase is accurate, it does not come close to
describing what's involved in making robust, reliable software. I will use my
experience building large scale systems to inform a first principles approach
to defining what it is we do – or should be doing – as software engineers. I'm
not interested in tired debates like dynamic vs. static languages – instead, I
intend to explore the really core aspects of software engineering.The first
order of business is to define what software engineering even is in the first
place. Software engineering is the construction of software that produces some
desired output for some range of inputs. The inputs to software are more than
just method parameters: they include the hardware on which it's running, the
rate at which it receives data, and anything else that influences the
operatio</p><p>3 0.095878564 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>4 0.07517951 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: In this tutorial forCascalog, we are going to create part of the back-end for
a simplified version of a Facebook-like news feed. In doing so we are going to
walk through an end-to-end example of running Cascalog on a production
cluster. If you're new to Cascalog, you should first look at the introductory
tutorialshereandhere.The code and sample data for the example presented in
this tutorial can be found onGithub.Problem descriptionA news feed ranks
events happening in your social network. Our program will take as input two
sources of data. The first is "follows" relationships which are stored in text
format:nathan bobchris mikemike chrismichelle nathanFollows relationships are
2-tuples of (username, username) with fields separated by whitespace.Our
second source of data is "action" data which is also stored in text

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that

<p>Introduction: Most people flee uncertainty. Yet being able to think well under uncertainty
can be very rewarding, and I've come to realize it's a skill that can be
learned. Here are some tips for thinking under uncertainty.1. Think in terms
of ranges of scenariosIn many situations, you only have limited information.
Our brains are quick to make conclusions and don't consider all the
scenarios.Don't let this happen.You have to realize that given the information
you have, there is a range of scenarios that could account for it.Talking to
someone who seems cold and aloof? Maybe the person is unfriendly, or maybe the
person is justshy.Is your boss micromanaging you lately? Maybe he doesn't
trust you, maybe he's under increased pressure fromhisboss, or maybe it's just
a random event.You need to avoid tunnel vision. It's easy to become focused on
one scenario - because you're afraid of the scenario or really hopeful for it
- and ignore information that points to other possibilities.For each decision

<p>Introduction: Last week I went to POSSCON in Columbia, South Carolina. It was an interesting
experience and a good reminder that not everyone in the world thinks like we
do in Silicon Valley.I gave two talks at the conference. One was a technical
talk about how to build realtime Big Data systems, and the other was a non-
technical talk about the things we do at BackType to be a super-productive
team. Both slide decks are embedded below.The Secrets of Building Realtime Big

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>4 0.28751898 <a title="21-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-13-Mimi_Silbert%3A_the_greatest_hacker_in_the_world.html">3 nathan marz storm-2010-01-13-Mimi Silbert: the greatest hacker in the world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a problem for you: build an organization that transforms thousands of
homeless people, ex-cons, and recovering drug addicts into productive members
of society.OK,now do it with no money and no staff. And achieve a >90% success
rate. While you're at it, make the organization double as a business that
provides valuable services to the community. And make the whole thing self-
sustaining.Amazingly, Mimi Silbert accomplishedthis very feat. She's been at
it for 35 years and her organization is called theDelancey Street Foundation.
I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I could find about how
Delancey Street operates, and simply put, it's the most spectacular and
innovative organization I've ever come across.At the highest level, Delancey
Street is a stunning example of social entrepreneurship. Residents work in
Delancey Street's numerous training schools, such as theirmoving
companyandrestaurant. These businesses give the residents marketable skills
and also generate</p><p>5 0.25615507 <a title="21-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>6 0.25423452 <a title="21-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-10-13-How_to_beat_the_CAP_theorem.html">31 nathan marz storm-2011-10-13-How to beat the CAP theorem</a></p>

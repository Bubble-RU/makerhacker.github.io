</p><p>3 These businesses give the residents marketable skills and also generate revenue to support the organization. [sent-11, score-0.608]
</p><p>4 What's really amazing is that the residents run the whole organization -- Mimi Silbert is the only "outsider" within Delancey Street. [sent-13, score-0.74]
</p><p>5 Mimi has crafted an organization where the residents have to support each other, teach each other, work for each other, and learn to care for each other. [sent-14, score-0.899]
</p><p>6 Asdescribedby Mimi Silbert:We determined that these people have been passive recipients their entire lives - they've received welfare, they've received therapy, they've received punishment, they've received analysis, and they're busy receiving statistics left and right. [sent-15, score-0.452]
</p><p>7 It's an 'each one teach one' place - every resident's in charge of teaching a newer resident what they've learned. [sent-30, score-0.322]
</p><p>8 And that's the basis of our organization: everyone is the therapist, everyone is the teacher, everyone is saying thank you to someone and everyone is having thank you said to them. [sent-34, score-0.344]
</p><p>9 Mimi discovered a wildly more effective way of rehabilitating people - make the residents be givers and teachers rather than just receivers. [sent-42, score-0.556]
</p><p>10 No staff is needed because the residents are the staff. [sent-44, score-0.53]
</p><p>11 And the philosophy of rehabilitation through doing meshes perfectly with entrepreneurship - operating businesses teaches the residents accountability, responsibility, and job skills, along with generating income to support Delancey Street1. [sent-46, score-0.652]
</p><p>12 Yet she held firm in her belief that these people were capable of being good, that these people we teach our children to fear can be transformed. [sent-51, score-0.337]
</p><p>13 For starters, the residents of Delancey Street don't exactly have healthy views on sexuality. [sent-53, score-0.468]
</p><p>14 "So we set a period of time in which residents are not allowed to touch or even say, 'Hey, you and me baby, in six months. [sent-68, score-0.468]
</p><p>15 "2Another serious problem Delancey Street deals with is that residents come into the organization and "don't think they need to be fixed because they're not broken. [sent-89, score-0.788]
</p><p>16 Another interesting example of an implementation detail that needed to be overcome were the residents' own biases and self-stereotypes:In the first few years of Delancey Street's growth, residents chose the area in which they wanted to be trained. [sent-97, score-0.672]
</p><p>17 However, the residents fell into the stereotypes job positions they assumed society held for them. [sent-98, score-0.574]
</p><p>18 The women chose paperwork jobs; the Blacks and Latins primarily chose physical labor; and the Anglo males picked sales. [sent-99, score-0.477]
</p><p>19 Now, every resident is briefly trained in one physical labor job; one sales-oriented job; and one paperwork job. [sent-100, score-0.361]
</p><p>20 After residents see they have abilities in areas beyond their stereotypic images, they can choose the field in which they want to make their careers. [sent-101, score-0.468]

<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>6 0.050699241 <a title="3-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's

<p>Introduction: Here's a problem for you: build an organization that transforms thousands of
homeless people, ex-cons, and recovering drug addicts into productive members
of society.OK,now do it with no money and no staff. And achieve a >90% success
rate. While you're at it, make the organization double as a business that
provides valuable services to the community. And make the whole thing self-
sustaining.Amazingly, Mimi Silbert accomplishedthis very feat. She's been at
it for 35 years and her organization is called theDelancey Street Foundation.
I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I could find about how
Delancey Street operates, and simply put, it's the most spectacular and
innovative organization I've ever come across.At the highest level, Delancey
Street is a stunning example of social entrepreneurship. Residents work in
Delancey Street's numerous training schools, such as theirmoving
companyandrestaurant. These businesses give the residents marketable skills

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>3 0.16417679 <a title="3-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that
you can sociali</p><p>4 0.14515074 <a title="3-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-05-10-Why_we_in_tech_must_support_Lawrence_Lessig.html">41 nathan marz storm-2014-05-10-Why we in tech must support Lawrence Lessig</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this
problem instantly by reclassifying the internet from an "information service"
to a</p><p>5 0.14485796 <a title="3-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>6 0.14448923 <a title="3-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>

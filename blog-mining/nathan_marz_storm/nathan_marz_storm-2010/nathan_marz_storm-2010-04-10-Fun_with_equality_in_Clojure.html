<p>Introduction: In thefirst tutorialforCascalog, I showed off many of Cascalog's powerful
features: joins, aggregates, subqueries, custom operations, and more. Since
Cascalog's release a couple weeks ago, I've added a number of new features to
Cascalog that seriously increase the expressiveness and performance of the
language without compromising its simplicity or flexibility.Like the first

'cascalog.playground) (bootstrap)moreOuter joinsAs we saw in the first
tutorial, you can join together multiple sources of data in Cascalog by using
the same variable name in multiple sources of data. For example, given "age"
and "gender" sources, we can get the age and gender for each person by
running:user=> (?<\- (stdout) [?person ?age ?gender](age ?person ?age) (gender

<p>Introduction: In this tutorial forCascalog, we are going to create part of the back-end for
a simplified version of a Facebook-like news feed. In doing so we are going to
walk through an end-to-end example of running Cascalog on a production
cluster. If you're new to Cascalog, you should first look at the introductory
tutorialshereandhere.The code and sample data for the example presented in
this tutorial can be found onGithub.Problem descriptionA news feed ranks
events happening in your social network. Our program will take as input two
sources of data. The first is "follows" relationships which are stored in text
format:nathan bobchris mikemike chrismichelle nathanFollows relationships are
2-tuples of (username, username) with fields separated by whitespace.Our

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago I read apostby Daniel Levine that shows a formal proof of x*0 = 0.
Here's a reprint of the proof:y = y (identity axiom)y - y = 0 (arithmetic)x*(y
- y) = 0 (substitution)x*y - x*y = 0 (distributive)x*y = x*y (arithmetic)The
logic of this proof is that since we can reduce x*0 = 0 to the identity axiom,
x*0 = 0 is true. Unfortunately, this is not logically sound.Now I don't mean
to pick on Daniel Levine. He's a really smart guy. I've made this same
mistake, and only when I lost points on problem sets a number of times did I
really understand the fallacy of this logic.To show why this logic is unsound,
here's a "proof" that 1 = 0:1 = 0 (hypothesis)0 * 1 = 0 * 0 (multiply each
side by same amount maintains equality)0 = 0 (arithmetic)According to the
logic of the previous proof, we have reduced 1 = 0 to 0 = 0, a known true
statement, so 1 = 0 is true. Obviously this is incorrect.What we have actually
shown is that 1 = 0implies0 = 0. You would write this out formally as:(1 = 0)

<p>Introduction: I ran into some very non-intuitive behavior from Clojure recently. See if you
can guess what "foo" is in the following examples:Example 1:user=> foo1user=>
(= foo 1)trueuser=> (= [foo 2] [1 2])trueuser=> (= {foo 2} {1 2})falseExample
2:user=> foofalseuser=> (= foo false)trueuser=> (when foo (println "shouldn't
print?"))shouldn't print?nilYikes, huh? Here are the answers:Example 1: (def
foo (Long. "1"))Example 2: (def foo (Boolean. false))For example 1, the map
equality breaks down because Long and Integer have different hashcodes for the
same numeric value. In example 2, Clojure considers anything besides false or
nil to be true in a conditional, so that means a false Boolean object will be
true in a conditional even though it's equal to "false".I would definitely
consider #1 a bug, as part of the contract of equality is that two equal
objects have the same hashcode. #2 is more debatable, but it seems more
intuitive that the Boolean object false be considered false in conditionals as

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because
there are no</p><p>3 0.3165009 <a title="12-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-27-Fastest_Viable_Product%3A_Investing_in_Speed_at_a_Startup.html">23 nathan marz storm-2010-10-27-Fastest Viable Product: Investing in Speed at a Startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A startup is like a rat in a maze searching for a piece of cheese. The cheese
in the startup's case isproduct-market fit, that pivotal point when the
startup can scale and monetize the business.In the maze, the startup has a
dazzling amount of choices of where to go. Should we build this new feature?
Should we try this new idea we have for a product? Should we backtrack and
completely change our idea?Lean startupsuse a strategy called "Minimum Viable
Products" to help navigate the maze. The idea is that a startup formulates
hypotheses about what users want or do not want; each of these hypotheses is a
"turn" in the maze. A "Minimum Viable Product" is the smallest test that will
let the startup know whether their "turn" was a good one. A startup wants to
stop going the wrong direction as early as possible.A "Minimum Viable Product"
can be anything from a working application to anSEO'd survey that will gauge
interest in an idea. "Minimum Viable Products"

<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>5 0.28664342 <a title="12-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-08-Follow-up_to_%22The_mathematics_behind_Hadoop-based_systems%22.html">8 nathan marz storm-2010-03-08-Follow-up to "The mathematics behind Hadoop-based systems"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In aprevious post, I developed an equation modeling the stable runtime of an
iterative, batch-oriented workflow. We saw how the equation explained a number
of counter-intuitive behaviors of batch-oriented systems. In this post, we
will learn how to measure the amount of overhead versus dynamic time in a
workflow, which is the first step in applying the theory to optimize a
workflow.Recall that we started with the equation for the runtime of a single
iteration of a workflow:Runtime = Overhead + {Time to process one hour of
data} * {Hours of Data}T = O + P * HWe ended with the equation for the stable
runtime of a workflow that runs repeatedly:{Stable Runtime} = Overhead / (1 -
{Time to process one hour of data}T = O / (1 - P)Measuring O and PThe first
step towards utilizing this theory for optimizing your workflow will be to
measure the values of O and P for your workflow. This can be difficult if the
cluster is shared with lots of other jobs, as the P for each run will vary.

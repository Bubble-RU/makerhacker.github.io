</p><p>5 A startup wants to stop going the wrong direction as early as possible. [sent-10, score-0.253]
</p><p>6 The real goal is to test hypotheses asfastas possible, and being minimal is just a side effect of being fast. [sent-14, score-0.821]
</p><p>7 "Minimum Viable Product" is focused on minimizing wasted work -- minimize the amount of code and features required to validate a hypothesis. [sent-17, score-0.251]
</p><p>8 When you're focused on speed, as opposed to just minimizing wasted work, you can work on things for the sole purpose of improving your iteration speed in the future. [sent-19, score-0.384]
</p><p>9 A rat with a jetpack will find the cheese faster than a rat without one. [sent-20, score-0.606]
</p><p>10 The large size and deeply interconnected nature of our dataset used to be a barrier to testing hypotheses quickly. [sent-24, score-0.732]
</p><p>11 Testing hypotheses was an exercise in figuring out what data to ignore and what parts of the algorithm to fake. [sent-25, score-0.518]
</p><p>12 The fact that we wanted to do things with our data that were difficult to do with our current infrastructure indicated that we could "build a jetpack" by scaling. [sent-26, score-0.218]
</p><p>13 The traditional risk of investing in back-end infrastructure is that it's a large time investment that doesn't directly test hypotheses about customers. [sent-27, score-1.1]
</p><p>14 If you have to significantly change direction, the investment could turn out to be a huge waste of time. [sent-28, score-0.276]
</p><p>15 The existence of the market was clear based on the number of companies in the space and the fact that customers were coming to us asking for better tools. [sent-30, score-0.189]
</p><p>16 We had reduced significant risk and knew that scaling would help us test hypotheses that were difficult for us at the time. [sent-31, score-1.092]
</p><p>17 Now, we can iterate on features and test hypotheses extremely quickly. [sent-33, score-0.836]
</p><p>18 They don't test hypotheses, but they help your startup move faster (and aren't huge investments). [sent-40, score-0.603]
</p><p>19 The tradeoff to investing in speed is that it takes away valuable time that could be spent testing hypotheses. [sent-41, score-0.352]
</p><p>20 If you succeed in increasing the speed of your iterations, you'll be able to test more hypotheses faster. [sent-43, score-0.931]

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in

interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>6 0.050972328 <a title="23-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-12-06-You_Are_a_Product.html">25 nathan marz storm-2010-12-06-You Are a Product</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a

<p>Introduction: A startup is like a rat in a maze searching for a piece of cheese. The cheese
in the startup's case isproduct-market fit, that pivotal point when the
startup can scale and monetize the business.In the maze, the startup has a
dazzling amount of choices of where to go. Should we build this new feature?
Should we try this new idea we have for a product? Should we backtrack and
completely change our idea?Lean startupsuse a strategy called "Minimum Viable
Products" to help navigate the maze. The idea is that a startup formulates
hypotheses about what users want or do not want; each of these hypotheses is a
"turn" in the maze. A "Minimum Viable Product" is the smallest test that will
let the startup know whether their "turn" was a good one. A startup wants to
stop going the wrong direction as early as possible.A "Minimum Viable Product"
can be anything from a working application to anSEO'd survey that will gauge
interest in an idea. "Minimum Viable Products"

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: I ran into some very non-intuitive behavior from Clojure recently. See if you
can guess what "foo" is in the following examples:Example 1:user=> foo1user=>
(= foo 1)trueuser=> (= [foo 2] [1 2])trueuser=> (= {foo 2} {1 2})falseExample
2:user=> foofalseuser=> (= foo false)trueuser=> (when foo (println "shouldn't
print?"))shouldn't print?nilYikes, huh? Here are the answers:Example 1: (def
foo (Long. "1"))Example 2: (def foo (Boolean. false))For example 1, the map
equality breaks down because Long and Integer have different hashcodes for the
same numeric value. In example 2, Clojure considers anything besides false or
nil to be true in a conditional, so that means a false Boolean object will be
true in a conditional even though it's equal to "false".I would definitely
consider #1 a bug, as part of the contract of equality is that two equal
objects have the same hashcode. #2 is more debatable, but it seems more
intuitive that the Boolean object false be considered false in conditionals as

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>5 0.17234735 <a title="23-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that

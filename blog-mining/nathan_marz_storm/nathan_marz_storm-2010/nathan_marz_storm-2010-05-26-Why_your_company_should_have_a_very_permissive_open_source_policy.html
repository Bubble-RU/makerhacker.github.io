the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to

</p><p>4 Top programmers aren't differentiated from the next tier of programmers and get badly mispriced in the market. [sent-8, score-0.759]
</p><p>5 Top programmers need better mechanisms to communicate their value so that they can be priced more fairly in the market. [sent-9, score-0.537]
</p><p>6 moreOpen source makes the market for an individual programmer more efficientOpen source is an equalizer. [sent-10, score-1.036]
</p><p>7 An open source project shows how a programmer goes about solving real problems that didn't have serviceable solutions yet. [sent-11, score-1.078]
</p><p>8 An open source project has much greater scope than anything that can be given to a programmer in a job interview and shows the kind of quality work a programmer produces from design to implementation to testing. [sent-12, score-1.343]
</p><p>9 The more mispriced a programmer, the more that programmer should desire being involved in open source to normalize his perceived value. [sent-14, score-1.372]
</p><p>10 The most mispriced programmers are those at the high end, the so called "rock stars" and "ninjas", so these programmers have the most to gain from open source. [sent-15, score-1.186]
</p><p>11 This means that companies with restrictive open source policies are putting up a barrier to recruiting stellar engineers. [sent-17, score-1.5]
</p><p>12 Companies may dislike open sourcing internal projects for a variety of reasons. [sent-18, score-0.632]
</p><p>13 They may feel that open source distracts the team from building out the products of the business. [sent-21, score-0.888]
</p><p>14 These are the tradeoffs in having a permissive open source policy and are tradeoffs that must be made to have access to "rock stars". [sent-22, score-1.593]
</p><p>15 Additionally, open source can give the company access to speaking engagements at user groups and conferences which is a great way to get the company's name out there and source candidates. [sent-25, score-1.375]
</p><p>16 Finally, there's the obvious benefit that the company can receive "free work" from outside contributions to their open source projects. [sent-26, score-0.932]
</p><p>17 This knowledge isn't universal yetA lot of programmers don't yet realize the value of having an open source portfolio, and there are certainly great programmers working for companies with restrictive open source policies. [sent-27, score-2.672]
</p><p>18 However, as more and more programmers realize how open source can increase their value, more and more companies will use a permissive open source policy as a recruitment tool. [sent-28, score-2.655]
</p><p>19 Of course, it takes more than having a permissive open source policy to recruit the superstar programmers. [sent-30, score-1.451]
</p><p>20 It's just that not having a permissive policy will eventually become a barrier to recruiting those programmers at all. [sent-31, score-1.019]

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: Having a permissive open source policy is important if a company wants to
recruit truly stellar programmers. Or put another way: great programmers will
be less inclined to work for you if you have a restrictive open source policy
because being involved in open source projects is one of the best ways for a
programmer to increase his market value.Traditional methods for measuring
programming ability are ineffectiveThe job market for programmers, especially
the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to
employers lacking good methods for evaluating programmers. The standard
techniques used to evaluate programmers -- resumes, on-the-spot coding
questions, take-home projects -- are at best crude approximations of a
programmer's ability, and none of them will be indicators of the truly
visionary people. Sure, there are other indicators like being involved in
successful companies or having past impressive titles, but those are still
indirect indicators of program</p><p>2 0.94832206 <a title="17-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>3 0.44926825 <a title="17-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-24-The_inexplicable_rise_of_open_floor_plans_in_tech_companies.html">40 nathan marz storm-2014-02-24-The inexplicable rise of open floor plans in tech companies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: I originally quoted the average price of office space as $36 / square
foot / month, where in reality it's per year. So I was accidentally weakening
my own argument! The post has been updated to reflect the right number.The
"open floor plan" has really taken over tech companies in San Francisco.
Offices are organized as huge open spaces with row after row of tables.
Employees sit next to each other and each have their own piece of desk space.
Now, I don't want to comment on the effectiveness of open floor plans for
fields other than my own. But for software development, this isthe single best
way to sabotage the productivity of your entire engineering team.The
problemProgramming is a very brain-intensive task. You have to hold all sorts
of disparate information in your head at once and synthesize it into extremely
precise code. It requires intense amounts of focus. Distractions and
interruptions are death to the productivity of a programmer. And an open-floor
plan encourages dis</p><p>4 0.43628722 <a title="17-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-12-06-You_Are_a_Product.html">25 nathan marz storm-2010-12-06-You Are a Product</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.
Your demand is yourperceived valueby others. At the end of the day, you will

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

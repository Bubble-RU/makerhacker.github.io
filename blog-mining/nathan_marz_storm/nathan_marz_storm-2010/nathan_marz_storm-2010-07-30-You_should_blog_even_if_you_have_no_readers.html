<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's

interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to

to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more

please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in

<p>Introduction: Spencer Fry wrote agreat poston "Why entrepreneurs should write." I would
further add that the benefits of writing are so extraordinary that you should
write a blog even if you have no readers (and regardless of whether you're an
entrepreneur).I have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some of them are just a few
ideas scribbled down arguing with myself. Most of them will never be
published, yet I got value out of writing all of them.Writing makes you a
better readerBlogging has changed how I read other people's writing.In
struggling to find the right ways to structure and present my posts, I am much
more attuned to what makes a good argument and what makes a bad argument. I am
better at seeing holes in other people's reasoning.At the same time, when
reading I am less likely to fall into the trap of discrediting a post with
weak counterclaims. In most any post, there are likely to be counterclaims
that are based onexceptional cases. Internet commenters love to point these
out. However, these ex</p><p>2 0.32331491 <a title="20-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>3 0.23788534 <a title="20-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>4 0.20938285 <a title="20-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>5 0.20823145 <a title="20-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that
you can sociali</p><p>6 0.19935045 <a title="20-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-08-Follow-up_to_%22The_mathematics_behind_Hadoop-based_systems%22.html">8 nathan marz storm-2010-03-08-Follow-up to "The mathematics behind Hadoop-based systems"</a></p>

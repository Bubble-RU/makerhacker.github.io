<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this
problem instantly by reclassifying the internet from an "information service"

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and

for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.
Your demand is yourperceived valueby others. At the end of the day, you will

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: When I was in high school, I started the Chess Club. I needed money to buy
chess sets and chess clocks to get the club going, but at first I had some
difficulty raising cash.Then I hacked the system, and Chess Club became a cash
generating machine.Before the hackClubs made money by reselling burritos or
pizza from nearby restaurants during lunch. Each of these lunch sales
typically made about $100 in profit. Since I didn't want to charge dues for
the club, I needed lunch sales to raise money for Chess Club.Unfortunately,
the rules around lunch sales were restrictive. Only one club could sell per
week, and other clubs like the Science Club had a much stronger precedent for
needing lunch sales. Without a precedent for needing money, I was unable to
acquire enough lunch sale dates.The hackI studied the rules for operating
clubs on campus and found the loophole I needed: clubs were allowed to go into
debt to the student government for $200. I figured that if I were in debt to

<p>Introduction: I used to send a job candidate an email like the following after the person
failed a phone interview:Hi [Candidate],Thanks a lot for taking the time to
interview with us. However, we've decided not to move forward in the process
with you. I wish you the best of luck on your future
projects.Best,NathanRejection emails like that are cold, impersonal, and
hollow. It doesn't feel good to send an email like that, and it sure doesn't
feel good to receive an email like that.You want a candidate to feel good
about your company even after failing the interview process. You don't want
the candidate to discourage their friends from interviewing with your company,
and ideally you want the candidate to refer their friends to your company.Now
I tell candidates on the spot whether they pass or fail at the end of the
phone interview. I give them feedback on what they did well and what they did
poorly. I'm very candid with them.The first time I tried this, I had
butterflies in my stomach. I thought to</p><p>3 0.087433673 <a title="24-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-26-My_conversation_with_the_great_John_McCarthy.html">4 nathan marz storm-2010-01-26-My conversation with the great John McCarthy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Back when I was a sophomore at Stanford, I cold emailedJohn McCarthy(inventor
of Lisp, one of the godfathers of AI) and asked if I could meet him and learn
about his life and perspective. To my pleasant surprise, he was happy to meet
with me. A week later I biked over to his house and had a very interesting two
hour conversation with him.McCarthy told me a lot about his career and his
transition from MIT to Stanford. What struck me the most though was what he
had to say about Lisp. Lisp was acomplete afterthoughtfor McCarthy. He just
needed a language for doing AI research, his true passion. Since the languages
available at that time were difficult to use, he created a language that he
felt would make him the most productive in his research. This reminds me a lot
about how Isaac Newton invented the tool of calculus to further his research
in gravity. Calculus transformed mathematics in its own right, and the
innovations of Lisp are still reverberating through the programming language

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>6 0.082621925 <a title="24-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>

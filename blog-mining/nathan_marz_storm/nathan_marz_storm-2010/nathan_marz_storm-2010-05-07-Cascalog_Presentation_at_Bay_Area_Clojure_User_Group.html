<p>Introduction: I'll be teaching a Cascalog workshop on February 19th at BackType HQ in Union Square. You can sign up at  http://cascalog.eventbrite.com . Early bird tickets are available until January 31st.
 
I'm very excited to be teaching this workshop. Cascalog's tight integration with Clojure opens up a world of techniques that no other data processing tool is able to do. Even though I created Cascalog, I've been discovering many of these techniques as I've made use of Cascalog for more and more varied tasks. Along the way, I've tweaked Cascalog so that making use of these techniques would be cleaner and more idiomatic. At this point, after nine months of iteration, Cascalog is a joy to use for even the most complex tasks. I'm excited to impart this knowledge upon others in this workshop.</p><p>3 0.14952071 <a title="15-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-04-27-New_Cascalog_features%3A_outer_joins%2C_combiners%2C_sorting%2C_and_more.html">14 nathan marz storm-2010-04-27-New Cascalog features: outer joins, combiners, sorting, and more</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the  first tutorial  for  Cascalog , I showed off many of Cascalog's powerful features: joins, aggregates, subqueries, custom operations, and more. Since Cascalog's release a couple weeks ago, I've added a number of new features to Cascalog that seriously increase the expressiveness and performance of the language without compromising its simplicity or flexibility.
 
Like the first tutorial, go ahead and load up the playground by issuing the following commands:
  lein compile-java && lein compile lein repl user=> (use 'cascalog.playground) (bootstrap)     Outer joins  
As we saw in the first tutorial, you can join together multiple sources of data in Cascalog by using the same variable name in multiple sources of data. For example, given "age" and "gender" sources, we can get the age and gender for each person by running:
  user=> (?<- (stdout) [?person ?age ?gender]           (age ?person ?age) (gender ?person ?gender))   
This is an  inner join .

<p>Introduction: I'm very excited to be releasing  Cascalog  as open-source today. Cascalog is a Clojure-based query language for Hadoop inspired by  Datalog .
  Highlights   
  Simple  - Functions, filters, and aggregators all use the same syntax. Joins are implicit and natural. 
  Expressive  - Logical composition is very powerful, and you can run arbitrary Clojure code in your query with little effort. 
  Interactive  - Run queries from the Clojure REPL. 
  Scalable  - Cascalog queries run as a series of MapReduce jobs. 
  Query anything  - Query HDFS data, database data, and/or local data by making use of Cascading's "Tap" abstraction 
  Careful handling of null values  - Null values can make life difficult. Cascalog has a feature called "non-nullable variables" that makes dealing with nulls painless. 
  First class interoperability with Cascading  - Operations defined for Cascalog can be used in a Cascading flow and vice-versa

<p>Introduction: Storm  was open-sourced exactly one year ago today. It's been an action-packed year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's happened over the past year:
  
 27 companies have publicized that they're  using Storm in production . I know of at least a few more companies using it that haven't published anything yet. 
 O'Reilly  published a book  on Storm. 
 The  Storm mailing list  has over 1300 members, with over 500 messages per month. 
 The  @stormprocessor  account has over 1200 followers. 
 More than 4000 people have starred the project  on Github . 
 There's a  regular Storm meetup  in the Bay Area with over 230 members. I've also seen lots of Storm-focused meetups happen all over the world over the past year. 
 29 people all over the world have contributed to the codebase 
 We released  Trident , a high level abstraction for realtime computation, that is a major leap forward in what's possible in realtime. 
 Libraries have been released integrating Stor</p><p>6 0.047571577 <a title="15-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-03-29-My_talks_at_POSSCON.html">30 nathan marz storm-2011-03-29-My talks at POSSCON</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I ran into some very non-intuitive behavior from Clojure recently. See if you can guess what "foo" is in the following examples:
  Example 1:   user=> foo 1 user=> (= foo 1) true user=> (= [foo 2] [1 2]) true user=> (= {foo 2} {1 2}) false    Example 2:   user=> foo false user=> (= foo false) true user=> (when foo (println "shouldn't print?")) shouldn't print? nil  
Yikes, huh? Here are the answers:
 
Example 1: (def foo (Long. "1"))
 
Example 2: (def foo (Boolean. false))
 
For example 1, the map equality breaks down because Long and Integer have different hashcodes for the same numeric value. In example 2, Clojure considers anything besides false or nil to be true in a conditional, so that means a false Boolean object will be true in a conditional even though it's equal to "false".
 
I would definitely consider #1 a bug, as part of the contract of equality is that two equal objects have the same hashcode. #2 is more debatable, but it seems more intuitive that the Boolean object false</p><p>6 0.062679596 <a title="15-lsi-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-09-19-Storm%27s_1st_birthday.html">34 nathan marz storm-2012-09-19-Storm's 1st birthday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'll be teaching a Cascalog workshop on February 19th at BackType HQ in Union Square. You can sign up at  http://cascalog.eventbrite.com . Early bird tickets are available until January 31st.
 
I'm very excited to be teaching this workshop. Cascalog's tight integration with Clojure opens up a world of techniques that no other data processing tool is able to do. Even though I created Cascalog, I've been discovering many of these techniques as I've made use of Cascalog for more and more varied tasks. Along the way, I've tweaked Cascalog so that making use of these techniques would be cleaner and more idiomatic. At this point, after nine months of iteration, Cascalog is a joy to use for even the most complex tasks. I'm excited to impart this knowledge upon others in this workshop.</p><p>3 0.02019746 <a title="15-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-09-19-Storm%27s_1st_birthday.html">34 nathan marz storm-2012-09-19-Storm's 1st birthday</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Storm  was open-sourced exactly one year ago today. It's been an action-packed year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's happened over the past year:
  
 27 companies have publicized that they're  using Storm in production . I know of at least a few more companies using it that haven't published anything yet. 
 O'Reilly  published a book  on Storm. 
 The  Storm mailing list  has over 1300 members, with over 500 messages per month. 
 The  @stormprocessor  account has over 1200 followers. 
 More than 4000 people have starred the project  on Github . 
 There's a  regular Storm meetup  in the Bay Area with over 230 members. I've also seen lots of Storm-focused meetups happen all over the world over the past year. 
 29 people all over the world have contributed to the codebase 
 We released  Trident , a high level abstraction for realtime computation, that is a major leap forward in what's possible in realtime. 
 Libraries have been released integrating Stor</p><p>4 0.0 <a title="15-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2009/nathan_marz_storm-2009-12-28-The_mathematics_behind_Hadoop-based_systems.html">1 nathan marz storm-2009-12-28-The mathematics behind Hadoop-based systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wish I had known this a year ago. Now, with some simple mathematics I can finally answer:
  
 Why doesn't the speed of my workflow double when I double the amount of processing power? 
 Why does a 10% failure rate cause my runtime to go up by 300%? 
 How does optimizing out 30% of my workflow runtime cause the runtime to decrease by 80%? 
 How many machines should I have in my cluster to be adequately performant and fault-tolerant? 
  
All of these questions are neatly answered by one simple equation:
 
Runtime = Overhead / (1 - {Time to process one hour of data})
 
We will derive this equation in a moment. First, let's briefly discuss what I mean by "Hadoop-based system."  1   A common use-case of Hadoop is running a workflow that processes a continuous stream of incoming data. The workflow runs in a "while(true)" loop, and each iteration of the workflow processes the data that accumulated since last iteration.
 
The inspiration for the following analysis can be summarized in a simp</p><p>5 0.0 <a title="15-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-03-Tips_for_Optimizing_Cascading_Flows.html">2 nathan marz storm-2010-01-03-Tips for Optimizing Cascading Flows</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a few tips for optimizing your Cascading flows. I also recommend checking out  "7 Tips for Improving MapReduce Performance"  for general MapReduce optimization tips.
  1. Filter data as early as possible  
Less data equals less work. Sometimes you can easily filter data out early by moving filters earlier in your flow. Other times, it can be more complicated.
 
One important use case that can be heavily optimized is querying a set of records for matches against a large set of keys - also known as a  batch query . You can read more about the mechanics of batch queries  here . You can find the source code for batch querying  here . The implementation utilizes a bloom filter to filter data out of the flow before using a join to complete the logic for the query.
 
Another wide-range of use cases involves keeping data in memory within each task for querying. For example, let's say you have a bunch of key-value pairs in HDFS, and you want all the pairs where the key  does not  belong</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="15-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-13-Mimi_Silbert%3A_the_greatest_hacker_in_the_world.html">3 nathan marz storm-2010-01-13-Mimi Silbert: the greatest hacker in the world</a></p>

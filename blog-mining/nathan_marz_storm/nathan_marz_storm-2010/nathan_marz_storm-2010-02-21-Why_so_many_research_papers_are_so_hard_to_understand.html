<p>Introduction: Back when I was a sophomore at Stanford, I cold emailed  John McCarthy  (inventor of Lisp, one of the godfathers of AI) and asked if I could meet him and learn about his life and perspective. To my pleasant surprise, he was happy to meet with me. A week later I biked over to his house and had a very interesting two hour conversation with him.
 
McCarthy told me a lot about his career and his transition from MIT to Stanford. What struck me the most though was what he had to say about Lisp. Lisp was a  complete afterthought  for McCarthy. He just needed a language for doing AI research, his true passion. Since the languages available at that time were difficult to use, he created a language that he felt would make him the most productive in his research. This reminds me a lot about how Isaac Newton invented the tool of calculus to further his research in gravity. Calculus transformed mathematics in its own right, and the innovations of Lisp are still reverberating through the programming</p><p>3 0.057291791 <a title="6-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-30-You_should_blog_even_if_you_have_no_readers.html">20 nathan marz storm-2010-07-30-You should blog even if you have no readers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Spencer Fry wrote a  great post  on "Why entrepreneurs should write." I would further add that the benefits of writing are so extraordinary that you should write a blog even if you have no readers (and regardless of whether you're an entrepreneur).
 
I have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some of them are just a few ideas scribbled down arguing with myself. Most of them will never be published, yet I got value out of writing all of them.
  Writing makes you a better reader  
Blogging has changed how I read other people's writing. 
 
In struggling to find the right ways to structure and present my posts, I am much more attuned to what makes a good argument and what makes a bad argument. I am better at seeing holes in other people's reasoning.
 
At the same time, when reading I am less likely to fall into the trap of discrediting a post with weak counterclaims. In most any post, there are likely to be counterclaims that are based on  exceptional cases .

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the recruitment process.
 
Now I'm a few years out of college and  I have that kick-ass job  I was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.
 
Here are my tips, from preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in the comments!
  Preparing for the job search  
 1. Make a list of the qualities you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the same:
 
 Write a blog. 
 
A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can do.
 
Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off – startups are  desperate  for talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of candidates.
 
Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume.

<p>Introduction: Wondering why so many research papers are so hard to read? I got some great words of wisdom from  Professor Jean-Claude Latombe  on the subject back when I was in his research group at Stanford. He described two strategies people employ for getting your paper published in a journal. The first is to do some great research and write the results up in a clear, well-written way.
 
Sometimes, however, you may invest time in research and end up with not particularly interesting results. If you wrote a paper describing your insignificant research in a clear manner, then your paper would clearly be bad and would be rejected. A strategy to employ in this scenario is to present your research in a complex, non-straightforward manner. Now no one will ever say your paper is great, but people will be less likely to say your paper is flat out bad (after all, it sounds like you were researching something really complex!). So your paper will fall into the middle of the pack which may be good enough to</p><p>2 0.97549701 <a title="6-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the recruitment process.
 
Now I'm a few years out of college and  I have that kick-ass job  I was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.
 
Here are my tips, from preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in the comments!
  Preparing for the job search  
 1. Make a list of the qualities you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific. 
 
What are you looking for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from?

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it more productive, your company has knowledge debt.
 
Companies tend to operate in ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly typical job ad:
  Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to join the engineering team.  Responsibilities      * Design core, back-end software components     * Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stability       of various system resources   Requirements      * M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred     * 2+ years of Java experience     * Expert in relational data modeling and query       optimization using MySQL  
I would posit a guess that this company uses Java for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right in" and contribute.
 
This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be hiring for problem solving skills</p><p>4 0.42637354 <a title="6-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-04-Introducing_%22Nanny%22_-_a_really_simple_dependency_management_tool.html">7 nathan marz storm-2010-03-04-Introducing "Nanny" - a really simple dependency management tool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dependency management in software projects is a pretty simple problem when you think about it.  A tool to manage dependencies just needs to do three things:
  
 Provide a mechanism to specify the direct dependencies to a project 
 Download the transitive closure of dependencies to a project 
 Publish packages that can be used as a dependency to other projects 
  
Some languages have good dependency management systems - for example, rubygems. Others, like Java, have tools like Maven which I would call a complex solution to a simple problem. You shouldn't need to buy a  book  to understand the solution to such a simple problem. Plus, these dependency management systems are all language specific.
 
I've seen companies do crazy things to manage their dependencies. One company, to manage their jar files, would put all the jars that any project might need in a special "jars" project. You would then need to setup a JARS_HOME environment variable and be sure to update the jars project if you n</p><p>5 0.39391607 <a title="6-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-24-The_inexplicable_rise_of_open_floor_plans_in_tech_companies.html">40 nathan marz storm-2014-02-24-The inexplicable rise of open floor plans in tech companies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: I originally quoted the average price of office space as $36 / square foot / month, where in reality it's per year. So I was accidentally weakening my own argument! The post has been updated to reflect the right number. 
 
The "open floor plan" has really taken over tech companies in San Francisco. Offices are organized as huge open spaces with row after row of tables. Employees sit next to each other and each have their own piece of desk space. Now, I don't want to comment on the effectiveness of open floor plans for fields other than my own. But for software development, this is  the single best way to sabotage the productivity of your entire engineering team .
  The problem  
Programming is a very brain-intensive task. You have to hold all sorts of disparate information in your head at once and synthesize it into extremely precise code. It requires intense amounts of focus. Distractions and interruptions are death to the productivity of a programmer. And an open-floor plan e</p><p>6 0.38011995 <a title="6-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>

please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>4 0.12509848 <a title="25-tfidf-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about

work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to

recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.
Your demand is yourperceived valueby others. At the end of the day, you will

<p>Introduction: Having a permissive open source policy is important if a company wants to
recruit truly stellar programmers. Or put another way: great programmers will
be less inclined to work for you if you have a restrictive open source policy
because being involved in open source projects is one of the best ways for a
programmer to increase his market value.Traditional methods for measuring
programming ability are ineffectiveThe job market for programmers, especially
the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to
employers lacking good methods for evaluating programmers. The standard
techniques used to evaluate programmers -- resumes, on-the-spot coding
questions, take-home projects -- are at best crude approximations of a
programmer's ability, and none of them will be indicators of the truly
visionary people. Sure, there are other indicators like being involved in
successful companies or having past impressive titles, but those are still
indirect indicators of program</p><p>3 0.25350791 <a title="25-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>4 0.19243868 <a title="25-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

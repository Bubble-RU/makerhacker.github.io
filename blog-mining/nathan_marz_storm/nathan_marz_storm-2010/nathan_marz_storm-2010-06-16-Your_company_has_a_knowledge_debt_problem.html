<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator â€“ and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities

<p>Introduction: Having a permissive open source policy is important if a company wants to
recruit truly stellar programmers. Or put another way: great programmers will
be less inclined to work for you if you have a restrictive open source policy
because being involved in open source projects is one of the best ways for a
programmer to increase his market value.Traditional methods for measuring
programming ability are ineffectiveThe job market for programmers, especially
the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about

work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be
hiring for problem solving skills, programming ability, and cultural fit, not
for any specif</p><p>2 0.28907046 <a title="18-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator â€“ and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>3 0.24784711 <a title="18-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because
there are no</p><p>4 0.24365517 <a title="18-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that
you can sociali</p><p>5 0.23122959 <a title="18-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-05-26-Why_your_company_should_have_a_very_permissive_open_source_policy.html">17 nathan marz storm-2010-05-26-Why your company should have a very permissive open source policy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Having a permissive open source policy is important if a company wants to
recruit truly stellar programmers. Or put another way: great programmers will
be less inclined to work for you if you have a restrictive open source policy
because being involved in open source projects is one of the best ways for a
programmer to increase his market value.Traditional methods for measuring
programming ability are ineffectiveThe job market for programmers, especially
the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to
employers lacking good methods for evaluating programmers. The standard
techniques used to evaluate programmers -- resumes, on-the-spot coding
questions, take-home projects -- are at best crude approximations of a
programmer's ability, and none of them will be indicators of the truly
visionary people. Sure, there are other indicators like being involved in
successful companies or having past impressive titles, but those are still
indirect indicators of program</p><p>6 0.2250575 <a title="18-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>

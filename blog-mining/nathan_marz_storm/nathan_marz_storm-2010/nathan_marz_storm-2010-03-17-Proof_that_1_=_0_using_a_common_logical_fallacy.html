[sent-7, score-0.678]
</p><p>4 You would write this out formally as:(1 = 0) -> (0 = 0)Let's take a quick detour to discuss the implication operator. [sent-10, score-0.156]
</p><p>5 Showing that A -> B is true doesn't mean that either A or B themselves are true. [sent-12, score-0.332]
</p><p>6 Instead, it shows that one of the followingcombinationsof A and B is valid:ABfalsefalsefalsetruetruetrue The only combination missing is true -> false, since something true can never imply something false. [sent-13, score-0.64]
</p><p>7 As you can see above, when B is true, A can be either true or false. [sent-14, score-0.292]
</p><p>8 So, if you can show A -> B to be true and also show that A is true, you can combine A and A -> B to show that B is true. [sent-16, score-0.629]
</p><p>9 As we just saw, this says nothing about the truthfulness of 1 = 0 and our proof is invalid. [sent-20, score-0.766]
</p><p>10 Likewise, the x*0 = 0 proof just showed that (x*0 = 0) -> (x*y = x*y) which doesn't prove the truthfulness of x*0 = 0. [sent-21, score-1.076]
</p><p>11 There's an easy fix to the proof by making use ofproof by contradiction. [sent-22, score-0.701]
</p><p>12 Proof by contradiction makes use of the fact that A -> B and ~B -> ~A ("~" meaning "boolean negation") are logically equivalent. [sent-23, score-0.446]
</p><p>13 By proving A to be true, we can combine A with A -> B using modus ponens to prove that B is true. [sent-26, score-0.478]
</p><p>14 This technique is called "proof by contradiction" because by assuming ~B to be true, we are able to show that both A and ~A are true which is a logical contradiction. [sent-27, score-0.427]
</p><p>15 Let's use proof by contradiction to fix the proof of x*0 = 0. [sent-28, score-1.693]

</p><p>19 I've only had to do a formal proof one time in the past two years, but the proof was for an algorithm whose correctness was absolutely critical for my company. [sent-44, score-1.411]
</p><p>20 More generally though, I find the rigorous, disciplined approach to thinking about problems to be really valuable. [sent-45, score-0.114]

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.
Your demand is yourperceived valueby others. At the end of the day, you will

<p>Introduction: I ran into some very non-intuitive behavior from Clojure recently. See if you
can guess what "foo" is in the following examples:Example 1:user=> foo1user=>
(= foo 1)trueuser=> (= [foo 2] [1 2])trueuser=> (= {foo 2} {1 2})falseExample
2:user=> foofalseuser=> (= foo false)trueuser=> (when foo (println "shouldn't

foo (Long. "1"))Example 2: (def foo (Boolean. false))For example 1, the map
equality breaks down because Long and Integer have different hashcodes for the
same numeric value. In example 2, Clojure considers anything besides false or
nil to be true in a conditional, so that means a false Boolean object will be
true in a conditional even though it's equal to "false".I would definitely
consider #1 a bug, as part of the contract of equality is that two equal
objects have the same hashcode. #2 is more debatable, but it seems more
intuitive that the Boolean object false be considered false in conditionals as

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: Spencer Fry wrote agreat poston "Why entrepreneurs should write." I would
further add that the benefits of writing are so extraordinary that you should
write a blog even if you have no readers (and regardless of whether you're an
entrepreneur).I have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some of them are just a few
ideas scribbled down arguing with myself. Most of them will never be
published, yet I got value out of writing all of them.Writing makes you a
better readerBlogging has changed how I read other people's writing.In
struggling to find the right ways to structure and present my posts, I am much
more attuned to what makes a good argument and what makes a bad argument. I am
better at seeing holes in other people's reasoning.At the same time, when
reading I am less likely to fall into the trap of discrediting a post with
weak counterclaims. In most any post, there are likely to be counterclaims
that are based onexceptional cases. Internet commenters love to point these
out. However, these ex</p><p>6 0.032986347 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-03-Tips_for_Optimizing_Cascading_Flows.html">2 nathan marz storm-2010-01-03-Tips for Optimizing Cascading Flows</a></p>

that can be heavily optimized is querying a set of records for matches against
a large set of keys - also known as abatch query. You can read more about the
mechanics of batch querieshere. You can find the source code for batch
queryinghere. The implementation utilizes a bloom filter to filter data out of
the flow before using a join to complete the logic for the query.Another wide-
range of use cases involves keeping data in memory within each task for
querying. For example, let's say you have a bunch of key-value pairs in HDFS,
and you want all the pairs where the keydoes notbelong in a separate list of

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.
Your demand is yourperceived valueby others. At the end of the day, you will

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago I read apostby Daniel Levine that shows a formal proof of x*0 = 0.
Here's a reprint of the proof:y = y (identity axiom)y - y = 0 (arithmetic)x*(y
- y) = 0 (substitution)x*y - x*y = 0 (distributive)x*y = x*y (arithmetic)The
logic of this proof is that since we can reduce x*0 = 0 to the identity axiom,
x*0 = 0 is true. Unfortunately, this is not logically sound.Now I don't mean
to pick on Daniel Levine. He's a really smart guy. I've made this same
mistake, and only when I lost points on problem sets a number of times did I
really understand the fallacy of this logic.To show why this logic is unsound,
here's a "proof" that 1 = 0:1 = 0 (hypothesis)0 * 1 = 0 * 0 (multiply each
side by same amount maintains equality)0 = 0 (arithmetic)According to the
logic of the previous proof, we have reduced 1 = 0 to 0 = 0, a known true
statement, so 1 = 0 is true. Obviously this is incorrect.What we have actually
shown is that 1 = 0implies0 = 0. You would write this out formally as:(1 = 0)

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>5 0.069783777 <a title="10-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-08-20-5_Tips_for_Thinking_Under_Uncertainty.html">21 nathan marz storm-2010-08-20-5 Tips for Thinking Under Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most people flee uncertainty. Yet being able to think well under uncertainty
can be very rewarding, and I've come to realize it's a skill that can be
learned. Here are some tips for thinking under uncertainty.1. Think in terms
of ranges of scenariosIn many situations, you only have limited information.
Our brains are quick to make conclusions and don't consider all the
scenarios.Don't let this happen.You have to realize that given the information
you have, there is a range of scenarios that could account for it.Talking to
someone who seems cold and aloof? Maybe the person is unfriendly, or maybe the
person is justshy.Is your boss micromanaging you lately? Maybe he doesn't
trust you, maybe he's under increased pressure fromhisboss, or maybe it's just
a random event.You need to avoid tunnel vision. It's easy to become focused on
one scenario - because you're afraid of the scenario or really hopeful for it
- and ignore information that points to other possibilities.For each decision

<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

<p>Introduction: Back when I was a sophomore at Stanford, I cold emailedJohn McCarthy(inventor
of Lisp, one of the godfathers of AI) and asked if I could meet him and learn
about his life and perspective. To my pleasant surprise, he was happy to meet
with me. A week later I biked over to his house and had a very interesting two
hour conversation with him.McCarthy told me a lot about his career and his
transition from MIT to Stanford. What struck me the most though was what he
had to say about Lisp. Lisp was acomplete afterthoughtfor McCarthy. He just
needed a language for doing AI research, his true passion. Since the languages
available at that time were difficult to use, he created a language that he
felt would make him the most productive in his research. This reminds me a lot
about how Isaac Newton invented the tool of calculus to further his research
in gravity. Calculus transformed mathematics in its own right, and the
innovations of Lisp are still reverberating through the programming language

<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>5 0.086764216 <a title="11-lsi-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-01-09-Early_access_edition_of_my_book_is_available.html">32 nathan marz storm-2012-01-09-Early access edition of my book is available</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be

<p>Introduction: I wish I had known this a year ago. Now, with some simple mathematics I can
finally answer:Why doesn't the speed of my workflow double when I double the
amount of processing power?Why does a 10% failure rate cause my runtime to go
up by 300%?How does optimizing out 30% of my workflow runtime cause the
runtime to decrease by 80%?How many machines should I have in my cluster to be
adequately performant and fault-tolerant?All of these questions are neatly
answered by one simple equation:Runtime = Overhead / (1 - {Time to process one
hour of data})We will derive this equation in a moment. First, let's briefly
discuss what I mean by "Hadoop-based system."1A common use-case of Hadoop is
running a workflow that processes a continuous stream of incoming data. The
workflow runs in a "while(true)" loop, and each iteration of the workflow
processes the data that accumulated since last iteration.The inspiration for
the following analysis can be summarized in a simple example. Let's say you

<p>Introduction: Here's a few tips for optimizing your Cascading flows. I also recommend
checking out"7 Tips for Improving MapReduce Performance"for general MapReduce
optimization tips.1. Filter data as early as possibleLess data equals less
work. Sometimes you can easily filter data out early by moving filters earlier
in your flow. Other times, it can be more complicated.One important use case
that can be heavily optimized is querying a set of records for matches against
a large set of keys - also known as abatch query. You can read more about the
mechanics of batch querieshere. You can find the source code for batch
queryinghere. The implementation utilizes a bloom filter to filter data out of
the flow before using a join to complete the logic for the query.Another wide-
range of use cases involves keeping data in memory within each task for
querying. For example, let's say you have a bunch of key-value pairs in HDFS,
and you want all the pairs where the keydoes notbelong in a separate list of

<p>Introduction: Here's a problem for you: build an organization that transforms thousands of
homeless people, ex-cons, and recovering drug addicts into productive members
of society.OK,now do it with no money and no staff. And achieve a >90% success
rate. While you're at it, make the organization double as a business that
provides valuable services to the community. And make the whole thing self-
sustaining.Amazingly, Mimi Silbert accomplishedthis very feat. She's been at
it for 35 years and her organization is called theDelancey Street Foundation.
I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I could find about how
Delancey Street operates, and simply put, it's the most spectacular and
innovative organization I've ever come across.At the highest level, Delancey
Street is a stunning example of social entrepreneurship. Residents work in
Delancey Street's numerous training schools, such as theirmoving
companyandrestaurant. These businesses give the residents marketable skills
and also generate</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="11-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-26-My_conversation_with_the_great_John_McCarthy.html">4 nathan marz storm-2010-01-26-My conversation with the great John McCarthy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

<p>Introduction: Here's a few tips for optimizing your Cascading flows. I also recommend
checking out"7 Tips for Improving MapReduce Performance"for general MapReduce
optimization tips.1. Filter data as early as possibleLess data equals less
work. Sometimes you can easily filter data out early by moving filters earlier
in your flow. Other times, it can be more complicated.One important use case
that can be heavily optimized is querying a set of records for matches against
a large set of keys - also known as abatch query. You can read more about the
mechanics of batch querieshere. You can find the source code for batch
queryinghere. The implementation utilizes a bloom filter to filter data out of
the flow before using a join to complete the logic for the query.Another wide-
range of use cases involves keeping data in memory within each task for
querying. For example, let's say you have a bunch of key-value pairs in HDFS,
and you want all the pairs where the keydoes notbelong in a separate list of

<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>6 0.11901074 <a title="16-lsi-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-03-Tips_for_Optimizing_Cascading_Flows.html">2 nathan marz storm-2010-01-03-Tips for Optimizing Cascading Flows</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In this tutorial forCascalog, we are going to create part of the back-end for
a simplified version of a Facebook-like news feed. In doing so we are going to
walk through an end-to-end example of running Cascalog on a production
cluster. If you're new to Cascalog, you should first look at the introductory
tutorialshereandhere.The code and sample data for the example presented in
this tutorial can be found onGithub.Problem descriptionA news feed ranks
events happening in your social network. Our program will take as input two
sources of data. The first is "follows" relationships which are stored in text
format:nathan bobchris mikemike chrismichelle nathanFollows relationships are
2-tuples of (username, username) with fields separated by whitespace.Our
second source of data is "action" data which is also stored in text

<p>Introduction: I'm very excited to be releasingCascalogas open-source today. Cascalog is a
Clojure-based query language for Hadoop inspired byDatalog.HighlightsSimple-
Functions, filters, and aggregators all use the same syntax. Joins are
implicit and natural.Expressive- Logical composition is very powerful, and you
can run arbitrary Clojure code in your query with little effort.Interactive-
Run queries from the Clojure REPL.Scalable- Cascalog queries run as a series
of MapReduce jobs.Query anything- Query HDFS data, database data, and/or local
data by making use of Cascading's "Tap" abstractionCareful handling of null
values- Null values can make life difficult. Cascalog has a feature called
"non-nullable variables" that makes dealing with nulls painless.First class
interoperability with Cascading- Operations defined for Cascalog can be used
in a Cascading flow and vice-versaFirst class interoperability with Clojure-
Can use regular Clojure functions as operations or filters, and since Cascalog
is a</p><p>3 0.23260441 <a title="16-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-04-27-New_Cascalog_features%3A_outer_joins%2C_combiners%2C_sorting%2C_and_more.html">14 nathan marz storm-2010-04-27-New Cascalog features: outer joins, combiners, sorting, and more</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In thefirst tutorialforCascalog, I showed off many of Cascalog's powerful
features: joins, aggregates, subqueries, custom operations, and more. Since
Cascalog's release a couple weeks ago, I've added a number of new features to
Cascalog that seriously increase the expressiveness and performance of the
language without compromising its simplicity or flexibility.Like the first
tutorial, go ahead and load up the playground by issuing the following
commands:lein compile-java && lein compilelein repluser=> (use
'cascalog.playground) (bootstrap)moreOuter joinsAs we saw in the first
tutorial, you can join together multiple sources of data in Cascalog by using
the same variable name in multiple sources of data. For example, given "age"
and "gender" sources, we can get the age and gender for each person by
running:user=> (?<\- (stdout) [?person ?age ?gender](age ?person ?age) (gender
?person ?gender))This is aninner join. We will only have results for people
that appear in both sets of data. We</p><p>4 0.18228389 <a title="16-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency.

<p>Introduction: In aprevious post, I developed an equation modeling the stable runtime of an
iterative, batch-oriented workflow. We saw how the equation explained a number
of counter-intuitive behaviors of batch-oriented systems. In this post, we
will learn how to measure the amount of overhead versus dynamic time in a
workflow, which is the first step in applying the theory to optimize a
workflow.Recall that we started with the equation for the runtime of a single
iteration of a workflow:Runtime = Overhead + {Time to process one hour of
data} * {Hours of Data}T = O + P * HWe ended with the equation for the stable
runtime of a workflow that runs repeatedly:{Stable Runtime} = Overhead / (1 -
{Time to process one hour of data}T = O / (1 - P)Measuring O and PThe first
step towards utilizing this theory for optimizing your workflow will be to
measure the values of O and P for your workflow. This can be difficult if the
cluster is shared with lots of other jobs, as the P for each run will vary.

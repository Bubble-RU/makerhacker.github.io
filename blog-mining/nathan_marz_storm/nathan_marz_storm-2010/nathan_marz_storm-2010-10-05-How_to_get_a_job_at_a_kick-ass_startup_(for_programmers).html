<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: Having a permissive open source policy is important if a company wants to
recruit truly stellar programmers. Or put another way: great programmers will
be less inclined to work for you if you have a restrictive open source policy
because being involved in open source projects is one of the best ways for a
programmer to increase his market value.Traditional methods for measuring
programming ability are ineffectiveThe job market for programmers, especially
the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to
employers lacking good methods for evaluating programmers. The standard
techniques used to evaluate programmers -- resumes, on-the-spot coding
questions, take-home projects -- are at best crude approximations of a
programmer's ability, and none of them will be indicators of the truly
visionary people. Sure, there are other indicators like being involved in
successful companies or having past impressive titles, but those are still
indirect indicators of program</p><p>6 0.14466465 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-12-09-How_to_reject_a_job_candidate_without_being_an_asshole.html">26 nathan marz storm-2010-12-09-How to reject a job candidate without being an asshole</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly

resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that
you can sociali</p><p>2 0.99287546 <a title="22-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-02-21-Why_so_many_research_papers_are_so_hard_to_understand.html">6 nathan marz storm-2010-02-21-Why so many research papers are so hard to understand</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wondering why so many research papers are so hard to read? I got some great
words of wisdom fromProfessor Jean-Claude Latombeon the subject back when I
was in his research group at Stanford. He described two strategies people
employ for getting your paper published in a journal. The first is to do some
great research and write the results up in a clear, well-written
way.Sometimes, however, you may invest time in research and end up with not
particularly interesting results. If you wrote a paper describing your
insignificant research in a clear manner, then your paper would clearly be bad
and would be rejected. A strategy to employ in this scenario is to present
your research in a complex, non-straightforward manner. Now no one will ever
say your paper is great, but people will be less likely to say your paper is
flat out bad (after all, it sounds like you were researching something really
complex!). So your paper will fall into the middle of the pack which may be
good enough to get pub</p><p>3 0.49613196 <a title="22-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-06-16-Your_company_has_a_knowledge_debt_problem.html">18 nathan marz storm-2010-06-16-Your company has a knowledge debt problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be
hiring for problem solving skills, programming ability, and cultural fit, not
for any specif</p><p>4 0.47568557 <a title="22-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>5 0.4756254 <a title="22-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>6 0.47479585 <a title="22-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-04-Introducing_%22Nanny%22_-_a_really_simple_dependency_management_tool.html">7 nathan marz storm-2010-03-04-Introducing "Nanny" - a really simple dependency management tool</a></p>

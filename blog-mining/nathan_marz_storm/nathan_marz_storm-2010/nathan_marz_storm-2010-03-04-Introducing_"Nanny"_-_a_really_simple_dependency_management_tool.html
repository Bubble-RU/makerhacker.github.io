<p>Introduction: This is the first in a series of posts on the principles of software
engineering. There's far more to software engineering than just "making
computers do stuff" – while that phrase is accurate, it does not come close to
describing what's involved in making robust, reliable software. I will use my
experience building large scale systems to inform a first principles approach
to defining what it is we do – or should be doing – as software engineers. I'm
not interested in tired debates like dynamic vs. static languages – instead, I
intend to explore the really core aspects of software engineering.The first
order of business is to define what software engineering even is in the first
place. Software engineering is the construction of software that produces some
desired output for some range of inputs. The inputs to software are more than
just method parameters: they include the hardware on which it's running, the
rate at which it receives data, and anything else that influences the
operatio</p><p>3 0.083266944 <a title="7-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>6 0.048783068 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dependency management in software projects is a pretty simple problem when you
think about it. A tool to manage dependencies just needs to do three
things:Provide a mechanism to specify the direct dependencies to a
projectDownload the transitive closure of dependencies to a projectPublish
packages that can be used as a dependency to other projectsSome languages have
good dependency management systems - for example, rubygems. Others, like Java,
have tools like Maven which I would call a complex solution to a simple
problem. You shouldn't need to buy abookto understand the solution to such a
simple problem. Plus, these dependency management systems are all language
specific.I've seen companies do crazy things to manage their dependencies. One
company, to manage their jar files, would put all the jars that any project
might need in a special "jars" project. You would then need to setup a
JARS_HOME environment variable and be sure to update the jars project if you
need any of the dependenc</p><p>2 0.2036173 <a title="7-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented_programming.html">33 nathan marz storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>3 0.20241293 <a title="7-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that

<p>Introduction: Wondering why so many research papers are so hard to read? I got some great
words of wisdom fromProfessor Jean-Claude Latombeon the subject back when I
was in his research group at Stanford. He described two strategies people
employ for getting your paper published in a journal. The first is to do some
great research and write the results up in a clear, well-written
way.Sometimes, however, you may invest time in research and end up with not
particularly interesting results. If you wrote a paper describing your
insignificant research in a clear manner, then your paper would clearly be bad
and would be rejected. A strategy to employ in this scenario is to present
your research in a complex, non-straightforward manner. Now no one will ever
say your paper is great, but people will be less likely to say your paper is
flat out bad (after all, it sounds like you were researching something really
complex!). So your paper will fall into the middle of the pack which may be
good enough to get pub</p><p>5 0.17833662 <a title="7-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>6 0.16850847 <a title="7-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-09-19-Storm%27s_1st_birthday.html">34 nathan marz storm-2012-09-19-Storm's 1st birthday</a></p>

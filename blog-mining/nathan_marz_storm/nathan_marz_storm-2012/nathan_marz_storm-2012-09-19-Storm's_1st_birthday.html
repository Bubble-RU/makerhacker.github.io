<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>3 0.21497843 <a title="34-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: This is the first in a series of posts on the principles of software
engineering. There's far more to software engineering than just "making
computers do stuff" – while that phrase is accurate, it does not come close to
describing what's involved in making robust, reliable software. I will use my
experience building large scale systems to inform a first principles approach
to defining what it is we do – or should be doing – as software engineers. I'm
not interested in tired debates like dynamic vs. static languages – instead, I
intend to explore the really core aspects of software engineering.The first
order of business is to define what software engineering even is in the first
place. Software engineering is the construction of software that produces some
desired output for some range of inputs. The inputs to software are more than
just method parameters: they include the hardware on which it's running, the
rate at which it receives data, and anything else that influences the

<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

<p>Introduction: Stormwas open-sourced exactly one year ago today. It's been an action-packed
year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's
happened over the past year:27 companies have publicized that they'reusing
Storm in production. I know of at least a few more companies using it that
haven't published anything yet.O'Reillypublished a bookon Storm.The Storm
mailing list has over 1300 members, with over 500 messages per month.The
@stormprocessor account has over 1200 followers.More than 4000 people have
starred the projecton Github.There's a regular Storm meetup in the Bay Area
with over 230 members. I've also seen lots of Storm-focused meetups happen all
over the world over the past year.29 people all over the world have
contributed to the codebaseWe releasedTrident, a high level abstraction for
realtime computation, that is a major leap forward in what's possible in
realtime.Libraries have been released integrating Storm with Kestrel, Kafka,
JMS, Cassandra, Memcached,</p><p>2 0.99490356 <a title="34-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-01-11-Cascalog_workshop.html">28 nathan marz storm-2011-01-11-Cascalog workshop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'll be teaching a Cascalog workshop on February 19th at BackType HQ in Union
Square. You can sign up athttp://cascalog.eventbrite.com. Early bird tickets
are available until January 31st.I'm very excited to be teaching this
workshop. Cascalog's tight integration with Clojure opens up a world of
techniques that no other data processing tool is able to do. Even though I
created Cascalog, I've been discovering many of these techniques as I've made
use of Cascalog for more and more varied tasks. Along the way, I've tweaked
Cascalog so that making use of these techniques would be cleaner and more
idiomatic. At this point, after nine months of iteration, Cascalog is a joy to
use for even the most complex tasks. I'm excited to impart this knowledge upon
others in this workshop.</p><p>3 0.24322821 <a title="34-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-04-Introducing_%22Nanny%22_-_a_really_simple_dependency_management_tool.html">7 nathan marz storm-2010-03-04-Introducing "Nanny" - a really simple dependency management tool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dependency management in software projects is a pretty simple problem when you
think about it. A tool to manage dependencies just needs to do three
things:Provide a mechanism to specify the direct dependencies to a
projectDownload the transitive closure of dependencies to a projectPublish
packages that can be used as a dependency to other projectsSome languages have
good dependency management systems - for example, rubygems. Others, like Java,
have tools like Maven which I would call a complex solution to a simple
problem. You shouldn't need to buy abookto understand the solution to such a
simple problem. Plus, these dependency management systems are all language
specific.I've seen companies do crazy things to manage their dependencies. One
company, to manage their jar files, would put all the jars that any project
might need in a special "jars" project. You would then need to setup a
JARS_HOME environment variable and be sure to update the jars project if you
need any of the dependenc</p><p>4 0.1962778 <a title="34-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>5 0.19462086 <a title="34-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-24-The_inexplicable_rise_of_open_floor_plans_in_tech_companies.html">40 nathan marz storm-2014-02-24-The inexplicable rise of open floor plans in tech companies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: I originally quoted the average price of office space as $36 / square
foot / month, where in reality it's per year. So I was accidentally weakening
my own argument! The post has been updated to reflect the right number.The
"open floor plan" has really taken over tech companies in San Francisco.
Offices are organized as huge open spaces with row after row of tables.
Employees sit next to each other and each have their own piece of desk space.
Now, I don't want to comment on the effectiveness of open floor plans for
fields other than my own. But for software development, this isthe single best
way to sabotage the productivity of your entire engineering team.The
problemProgramming is a very brain-intensive task. You have to hold all sorts
of disparate information in your head at once and synthesize it into extremely
precise code. It requires intense amounts of focus. Distractions and
interruptions are death to the productivity of a programmer. And an open-floor
plan encourages dis</p><p>6 0.18708591 <a title="34-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>

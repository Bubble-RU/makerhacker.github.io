<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's
happened over the past year:27 companies have publicized that they'reusing

<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

<p>Introduction: This is the first in a series of posts on the principles of software
engineering. There's far more to software engineering than just "making
computers do stuff" – while that phrase is accurate, it does not come close to
describing what's involved in making robust, reliable software. I will use my
experience building large scale systems to inform a first principles approach
to defining what it is we do – or should be doing – as software engineers. I'm
not interested in tired debates like dynamic vs. static languages – instead, I
intend to explore the really core aspects of software engineering.The first
order of business is to define what software engineering even is in the first
place. Software engineering is the construction of software that produces some
desired output for some range of inputs. The inputs to software are more than
just method parameters: they include the hardware on which it's running, the
rate at which it receives data, and anything else that influences the
operatio</p><p>6 0.095923632 <a title="33-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There's been a lot of speculation about what my new startup is doing, so I've
decided to set the record straight and reveal all. We are working on one of
the biggest problems on Earth, a problem that affects nearly every person on
this planet. Our products will significantly improve the quality of life for
billions of people.We are going to revolutionize the bedsheet industry.Think
about it. There's been almost no innovation in bedsheets in thousands of
years. There's nothing worse than waking up to discover one of the corners of
your Egyptian cotton fitted sheets has slipped off the mattress. How is this
not a solved problem yet? Why are we still using sheets with that annoying
elastic in it to secure them to our mattresses? They slip all the time – and
if you have a deep mattress, good luck finding sheets that even fit. You're
just screwed.Consider the impact of solving this problem, of a bedsheet
product thatneverslips, thatalwaysstays secure on the mattress. This

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>2 0.36398149 <a title="33-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>3 0.35141051 <a title="33-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-10-13-How_to_beat_the_CAP_theorem.html">31 nathan marz storm-2011-10-13-How to beat the CAP theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to
the cl</p><p>4 0.28585038 <a title="33-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-04-Introducing_%22Nanny%22_-_a_really_simple_dependency_management_tool.html">7 nathan marz storm-2010-03-04-Introducing "Nanny" - a really simple dependency management tool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dependency management in software projects is a pretty simple problem when you
think about it. A tool to manage dependencies just needs to do three
things:Provide a mechanism to specify the direct dependencies to a
projectDownload the transitive closure of dependencies to a projectPublish
packages that can be used as a dependency to other projectsSome languages have
good dependency management systems - for example, rubygems. Others, like Java,
have tools like Maven which I would call a complex solution to a simple
problem. You shouldn't need to buy abookto understand the solution to such a
simple problem. Plus, these dependency management systems are all language
specific.I've seen companies do crazy things to manage their dependencies. One
company, to manage their jar files, would put all the jars that any project
might need in a special "jars" project. You would then need to setup a
JARS_HOME environment variable and be sure to update the jars project if you
need any of the dependenc</p><p>5 0.22801201 <a title="33-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>6 0.21999253 <a title="33-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-01-19-Inglourious_Software_Patents.html">29 nathan marz storm-2011-01-19-Inglourious Software Patents</a></p>

</p><p>2 One of the best ways to become a better programmer is to learn new programming languages. [sent-14, score-0.477]
</p><p>3 By learn I mean more than just learning the syntax of the language, I mean understanding the language's idioms and writing something substantial in it. [sent-15, score-0.376]
</p><p>4 For me, learning Clojure made me a much better programmer in all languages. [sent-16, score-0.332]
</p><p>5 I took a bunch of "algorithmic game theory" classes with him – algorithmic game theory is basically the intersection of economics and computer science. [sent-23, score-0.334]
</p><p>6 I took the classes not so much for the material but to improve my problem solving skills. [sent-24, score-0.396]
</p><p>7 Learning those skills has made me a much better problem solver in all scenarios, as well as being a much better communicator of difficult concepts. [sent-26, score-0.388]
</p><p>8 They provide a 6 week bootcamp to help math/science/physics PhD's learn programming skills so they can start a career in data science. [sent-44, score-0.379]
</p><p>9 I think the industry will be much better off by building these systems more rigorously and less haphazardly, and I felt that this book was the right way to effect that change. [sent-53, score-0.393]
</p><p>10 I knew that writing a book would be a lot of work, but it turned about to be signicantly more work than I expected. [sent-54, score-0.378]
</p><p>11 At one point I had half the book written, but I realized I was taking the wrong approach to communicating the material so I scrapped everything and started over. [sent-56, score-0.308]
</p><p>12 I was taught to make your general "thesis" statement up front, and then drill down into that general statement with supporting points and eventually specific details. [sent-60, score-0.577]
</p><p>13 A much better way to communicate is to tell a story – start with a situation the reader already understands, and then connect step by step to the ultimate general statement you want your reader to understand. [sent-65, score-0.793]
</p><p>14 Specific to general is always better than general to specific. [sent-66, score-0.377]
</p><p>15 On top of that, when you open source software as a company, you benefit from other people trying it out, finding issues, and improving your software "for free". [sent-72, score-0.309]
</p><p>16 He told me he needed a better programming language for doing AI research, so he invented Lisp for that purpose. [sent-88, score-0.477]
</p><p>17 He really didn't seem to care that much about programming languages – his real passion was AI. [sent-89, score-0.306]
</p><p>18 The general idea is to avoid making "general" or "extensible" solutions until you have a very deep understanding of the problem domain. [sent-99, score-0.317]
</p><p>19 The key was that we had tons of experience with realtime computation so knew the problem domain very well. [sent-144, score-0.313]

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>3 0.21497843 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-09-19-Storm%27s_1st_birthday.html">34 nathan marz storm-2012-09-19-Storm's 1st birthday</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stormwas open-sourced exactly one year ago today. It's been an action-packed
year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's
happened over the past year:27 companies have publicized that they'reusing
Storm in production. I know of at least a few more companies using it that
haven't published anything yet.O'Reillypublished a bookon Storm.The Storm
mailing list has over 1300 members, with over 500 messages per month.The
@stormprocessor account has over 1200 followers.More than 4000 people have
starred the projecton Github.There's a regular Storm meetup in the Bay Area
with over 230 members. I've also seen lots of Storm-focused meetups happen all
over the world over the past year.29 people all over the world have
contributed to the codebaseWe releasedTrident, a high level abstraction for
realtime computation, that is a major leap forward in what's possible in
realtime.Libraries have been released integrating Storm with Kestrel, Kafka,
JMS, Cassandra, Memcached,</p><p>4 0.20677945 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>5 0.19200388 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>2 0.37274864 <a title="39-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-06-16-Your_company_has_a_knowledge_debt_problem.html">18 nathan marz storm-2010-06-16-Your company has a knowledge debt problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be

<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>4 0.34574956 <a title="39-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>5 0.33758757 <a title="39-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-10-13-How_to_beat_the_CAP_theorem.html">31 nathan marz storm-2011-10-13-How to beat the CAP theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

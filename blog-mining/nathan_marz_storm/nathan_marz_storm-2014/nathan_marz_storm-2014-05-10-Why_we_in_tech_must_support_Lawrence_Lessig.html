<p>Introduction: When I was in high school, I started the Chess Club. I needed money to buy
chess sets and chess clocks to get the club going, but at first I had some
difficulty raising cash.Then I hacked the system, and Chess Club became a cash
generating machine.Before the hackClubs made money by reselling burritos or
pizza from nearby restaurants during lunch. Each of these lunch sales
typically made about $100 in profit. Since I didn't want to charge dues for
the club, I needed lunch sales to raise money for Chess Club.Unfortunately,
the rules around lunch sales were restrictive. Only one club could sell per
week, and other clubs like the Science Club had a much stronger precedent for
needing lunch sales. Without a precedent for needing money, I was unable to
acquire enough lunch sale dates.The hackI studied the rules for operating
clubs on campus and found the loophole I needed: clubs were allowed to go into

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>6 0.066100545 <a title="41-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-13-Mimi_Silbert%3A_the_greatest_hacker_in_the_world.html">3 nathan marz storm-2010-01-13-Mimi Silbert: the greatest hacker in the world</a></p>

homeless people, ex-cons, and recovering drug addicts into productive members
of society.OK,now do it with no money and no staff. And achieve a >90% success
rate. While you're at it, make the organization double as a business that
provides valuable services to the community. And make the whole thing self-
sustaining.Amazingly, Mimi Silbert accomplishedthis very feat. She's been at
it for 35 years and her organization is called theDelancey Street Foundation.
I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I could find about how
Delancey Street operates, and simply put, it's the most spectacular and
innovative organization I've ever come across.At the highest level, Delancey
Street is a stunning example of social entrepreneurship. Residents work in
Delancey Street's numerous training schools, such as theirmoving

<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this
problem instantly by reclassifying the internet from an "information service"
to a</p><p>2 0.46141642 <a title="41-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>3 0.17710066 <a title="41-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>4 0.16636108 <a title="41-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-13-Mimi_Silbert%3A_the_greatest_hacker_in_the_world.html">3 nathan marz storm-2010-01-13-Mimi Silbert: the greatest hacker in the world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a problem for you: build an organization that transforms thousands of
homeless people, ex-cons, and recovering drug addicts into productive members
of society.OK,now do it with no money and no staff. And achieve a >90% success
rate. While you're at it, make the organization double as a business that
provides valuable services to the community. And make the whole thing self-
sustaining.Amazingly, Mimi Silbert accomplishedthis very feat. She's been at
it for 35 years and her organization is called theDelancey Street Foundation.
I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I could find about how
Delancey Street operates, and simply put, it's the most spectacular and
innovative organization I've ever come across.At the highest level, Delancey
Street is a stunning example of social entrepreneurship. Residents work in
Delancey Street's numerous training schools, such as theirmoving
companyandrestaurant. These businesses give the residents marketable skills
and also generate</p><p>5 0.16176572 <a title="41-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-01-19-Inglourious_Software_Patents.html">29 nathan marz storm-2011-01-19-Inglourious Software Patents</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most articles arguing for the abolishment of software patents focus on how so
many software patents don't meet the "non-obvious and non-trivial" guidelines
for patents. The problem with this approach is that the same argument could be
used to advocate for reform in how software patents are evaluated rather than
the abolishment of software patents altogether.Software patents should be
abolished though, and I'm going to show this with an economic analysis. We'll
see that even non-obvious and non-trivial software patents should never be
granted as they can only cause economic loss.Why do patents exist in the first
place?The patent system exists to provide an incentive for innovationwhere
that incentive would not have existed otherwise.Imagine you're an individual
living in the 19th century. Let's say the patent system does not exist and you
have an idea to make a radically better kind of sewing machine. If you
invested the time to develop your idea into a working invention, the existing

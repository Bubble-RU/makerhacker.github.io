<p>Introduction: I used to send a job candidate an email like the following after the person
failed a phone interview:Hi [Candidate],Thanks a lot for taking the time to
interview with us. However, we've decided not to move forward in the process
with you. I wish you the best of luck on your future
projects.Best,NathanRejection emails like that are cold, impersonal, and
hollow. It doesn't feel good to send an email like that, and it sure doesn't
feel good to receive an email like that.You want a candidate to feel good
about your company even after failing the interview process. You don't want
the candidate to discourage their friends from interviewing with your company,
and ideally you want the candidate to refer their friends to your company.Now
I tell candidates on the spot whether they pass or fail at the end of the
phone interview. I give them feedback on what they did well and what they did
poorly. I'm very candid with them.The first time I tried this, I had
butterflies in my stomach. I thought to</p><p>2 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-25" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-12-06-You_Are_a_Product.html">nathan marz storm-2010-12-06-You Are a Product</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and
"employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and
you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your
career as a product development problem.You sell yourself for various things:
money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good
coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but
please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.Supply and
DemandLike any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you
can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful
websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the
best work out of others. Your supply is theactual valueyou will provide to a
company that hires you.Your demand is what companiesthinkyou can do for them.
Your demand is yourperceived valueby others. At the end of the day, you will

<p>Introduction: When I was in high school, I started the Chess Club. I needed money to buy
chess sets and chess clocks to get the club going, but at first I had some
difficulty raising cash.Then I hacked the system, and Chess Club became a cash
generating machine.Before the hackClubs made money by reselling burritos or
pizza from nearby restaurants during lunch. Each of these lunch sales
typically made about $100 in profit. Since I didn't want to charge dues for
the club, I needed lunch sales to raise money for Chess Club.Unfortunately,
the rules around lunch sales were restrictive. Only one club could sell per
week, and other clubs like the Science Club had a much stronger precedent for
needing lunch sales. Without a precedent for needing money, I was unable to
acquire enough lunch sale dates.The hackI studied the rules for operating
clubs on campus and found the loophole I needed: clubs were allowed to go into
debt to the student government for $200. I figured that if I were in debt to
the student g</p><p>4 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-23" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-27-Fastest_Viable_Product%3A_Investing_in_Speed_at_a_Startup.html">nathan marz storm-2010-10-27-Fastest Viable Product: Investing in Speed at a Startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A startup is like a rat in a maze searching for a piece of cheese. The cheese
in the startup's case isproduct-market fit, that pivotal point when the
startup can scale and monetize the business.In the maze, the startup has a
dazzling amount of choices of where to go. Should we build this new feature?
Should we try this new idea we have for a product? Should we backtrack and
completely change our idea?Lean startupsuse a strategy called "Minimum Viable
Products" to help navigate the maze. The idea is that a startup formulates
hypotheses about what users want or do not want; each of these hypotheses is a
"turn" in the maze. A "Minimum Viable Product" is the smallest test that will
let the startup know whether their "turn" was a good one. A startup wants to
stop going the wrong direction as early as possible.A "Minimum Viable Product"
can be anything from a working application to anSEO'd survey that will gauge
interest in an idea. "Minimum Viable Products"

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that

<p>Introduction: Most people flee uncertainty. Yet being able to think well under uncertainty
can be very rewarding, and I've come to realize it's a skill that can be
learned. Here are some tips for thinking under uncertainty.1. Think in terms
of ranges of scenariosIn many situations, you only have limited information.
Our brains are quick to make conclusions and don't consider all the
scenarios.Don't let this happen.You have to realize that given the information
you have, there is a range of scenarios that could account for it.Talking to
someone who seems cold and aloof? Maybe the person is unfriendly, or maybe the
person is justshy.Is your boss micromanaging you lately? Maybe he doesn't
trust you, maybe he's under increased pressure fromhisboss, or maybe it's just
a random event.You need to avoid tunnel vision. It's easy to become focused on
one scenario - because you're afraid of the scenario or really hopeful for it
- and ignore information that points to other possibilities.For each decision
you c</p><p>7 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-20" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-30-You_should_blog_even_if_you_have_no_readers.html">nathan marz storm-2010-07-30-You should blog even if you have no readers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Spencer Fry wrote agreat poston "Why entrepreneurs should write." I would
further add that the benefits of writing are so extraordinary that you should
write a blog even if you have no readers (and regardless of whether you're an
entrepreneur).I have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some of them are just a few
ideas scribbled down arguing with myself. Most of them will never be
published, yet I got value out of writing all of them.Writing makes you a
better readerBlogging has changed how I read other people's writing.In
struggling to find the right ways to structure and present my posts, I am much
more attuned to what makes a good argument and what makes a bad argument. I am
better at seeing holes in other people's reasoning.At the same time, when
reading I am less likely to fall into the trap of discrediting a post with
weak counterclaims. In most any post, there are likely to be counterclaims
that are based onexceptional cases. Internet commenters love to point these
out. However, these ex</p><p>8 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-19" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be
hiring for problem solving skills, programming ability, and cultural fit, not
for any specif</p><p>10 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-17" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-05-26-Why_your_company_should_have_a_very_permissive_open_source_policy.html">nathan marz storm-2010-05-26-Why your company should have a very permissive open source policy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Having a permissive open source policy is important if a company wants to
recruit truly stellar programmers. Or put another way: great programmers will
be less inclined to work for you if you have a restrictive open source policy
because being involved in open source projects is one of the best ways for a
programmer to increase his market value.Traditional methods for measuring
programming ability are ineffectiveThe job market for programmers, especially
the top programmers, is notoriously inefficient. This inefficiency is due to
employers lacking good methods for evaluating programmers. The standard
techniques used to evaluate programmers -- resumes, on-the-spot coding
questions, take-home projects -- are at best crude approximations of a
programmer's ability, and none of them will be indicators of the truly
visionary people. Sure, there are other indicators like being involved in
successful companies or having past impressive titles, but those are still
indirect indicators of program</p><p>11 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-16" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-05-08-News_Feed_in_38_lines_of_code_using_Cascalog.html">nathan marz storm-2010-05-08-News Feed in 38 lines of code using Cascalog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In this tutorial forCascalog, we are going to create part of the back-end for
a simplified version of a Facebook-like news feed. In doing so we are going to
walk through an end-to-end example of running Cascalog on a production
cluster. If you're new to Cascalog, you should first look at the introductory
tutorialshereandhere.The code and sample data for the example presented in
this tutorial can be found onGithub.Problem descriptionA news feed ranks
events happening in your social network. Our program will take as input two
sources of data. The first is "follows" relationships which are stored in text
format:nathan bobchris mikemike chrismichelle nathanFollows relationships are
2-tuples of (username, username) with fields separated by whitespace.Our
second source of data is "action" data which is also stored in text

<p>Introduction: In thefirst tutorialforCascalog, I showed off many of Cascalog's powerful
features: joins, aggregates, subqueries, custom operations, and more. Since
Cascalog's release a couple weeks ago, I've added a number of new features to
Cascalog that seriously increase the expressiveness and performance of the
language without compromising its simplicity or flexibility.Like the first
tutorial, go ahead and load up the playground by issuing the following
commands:lein compile-java && lein compilelein repluser=> (use
'cascalog.playground) (bootstrap)moreOuter joinsAs we saw in the first
tutorial, you can join together multiple sources of data in Cascalog by using
the same variable name in multiple sources of data. For example, given "age"
and "gender" sources, we can get the age and gender for each person by
running:user=> (?<\- (stdout) [?person ?age ?gender](age ?person ?age) (gender
?person ?gender))This is aninner join. We will only have results for people
that appear in both sets of data.

<p>Introduction: I'm very excited to be releasingCascalogas open-source today. Cascalog is a
Clojure-based query language for Hadoop inspired byDatalog.HighlightsSimple-
Functions, filters, and aggregators all use the same syntax. Joins are
implicit and natural.Expressive- Logical composition is very powerful, and you
can run arbitrary Clojure code in your query with little effort.Interactive-
Run queries from the Clojure REPL.Scalable- Cascalog queries run as a series
of MapReduce jobs.Query anything- Query HDFS data, database data, and/or local
data by making use of Cascading's "Tap" abstractionCareful handling of null
values- Null values can make life difficult. Cascalog has a feature called
"non-nullable variables" that makes dealing with nulls painless.First class
interoperability with Cascading- Operations defined for Cascalog can be used
in a Cascading flow and vice-versaFirst class interoperability with Clojure-
Can use regular Clojure functions as operations or filters, and since Cascalog

<p>Introduction: I ran into some very non-intuitive behavior from Clojure recently. See if you
can guess what "foo" is in the following examples:Example 1:user=> foo1user=>
(= foo 1)trueuser=> (= [foo 2] [1 2])trueuser=> (= {foo 2} {1 2})falseExample
2:user=> foofalseuser=> (= foo false)trueuser=> (when foo (println "shouldn't
print?"))shouldn't print?nilYikes, huh? Here are the answers:Example 1: (def
foo (Long. "1"))Example 2: (def foo (Boolean. false))For example 1, the map
equality breaks down because Long and Integer have different hashcodes for the
same numeric value. In example 2, Clojure considers anything besides false or
nil to be true in a conditional, so that means a false Boolean object will be
true in a conditional even though it's equal to "false".I would definitely
consider #1 a bug, as part of the contract of equality is that two equal
objects have the same hashcode. #2 is more debatable, but it seems more
intuitive that the Boolean object false be considered false in conditionals as

database to Hadoop, the problems with existing solutions, and a new solution
that we open-sourced on theBackType tech blog. The tool we open-sourced is on

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago I read apostby Daniel Levine that shows a formal proof of x*0 = 0.
Here's a reprint of the proof:y = y (identity axiom)y - y = 0 (arithmetic)x*(y
- y) = 0 (substitution)x*y - x*y = 0 (distributive)x*y = x*y (arithmetic)The
logic of this proof is that since we can reduce x*0 = 0 to the identity axiom,
x*0 = 0 is true. Unfortunately, this is not logically sound.Now I don't mean
to pick on Daniel Levine. He's a really smart guy. I've made this same
mistake, and only when I lost points on problem sets a number of times did I
really understand the fallacy of this logic.To show why this logic is unsound,
here's a "proof" that 1 = 0:1 = 0 (hypothesis)0 * 1 = 0 * 0 (multiply each
side by same amount maintains equality)0 = 0 (arithmetic)According to the
logic of the previous proof, we have reduced 1 = 0 to 0 = 0, a known true
statement, so 1 = 0 is true. Obviously this is incorrect.What we have actually
shown is that 1 = 0implies0 = 0. You would write this out formally as:(1 = 0)

<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency.

<p>Introduction: In aprevious post, I developed an equation modeling the stable runtime of an
iterative, batch-oriented workflow. We saw how the equation explained a number
of counter-intuitive behaviors of batch-oriented systems. In this post, we
will learn how to measure the amount of overhead versus dynamic time in a
workflow, which is the first step in applying the theory to optimize a
workflow.Recall that we started with the equation for the runtime of a single
iteration of a workflow:Runtime = Overhead + {Time to process one hour of
data} * {Hours of Data}T = O + P * HWe ended with the equation for the stable
runtime of a workflow that runs repeatedly:{Stable Runtime} = Overhead / (1 -
{Time to process one hour of data}T = O / (1 - P)Measuring O and PThe first
step towards utilizing this theory for optimizing your workflow will be to
measure the values of O and P for your workflow. This can be difficult if the
cluster is shared with lots of other jobs, as the P for each run will vary.

<p>Introduction: Dependency management in software projects is a pretty simple problem when you
think about it. A tool to manage dependencies just needs to do three
things:Provide a mechanism to specify the direct dependencies to a
projectDownload the transitive closure of dependencies to a projectPublish
packages that can be used as a dependency to other projectsSome languages have
good dependency management systems - for example, rubygems. Others, like Java,
have tools like Maven which I would call a complex solution to a simple
problem. You shouldn't need to buy abookto understand the solution to such a
simple problem. Plus, these dependency management systems are all language
specific.I've seen companies do crazy things to manage their dependencies. One
company, to manage their jar files, would put all the jars that any project
might need in a special "jars" project. You would then need to setup a
JARS_HOME environment variable and be sure to update the jars project if you
need any of the dependenc</p><p>21 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-02-21-Why_so_many_research_papers_are_so_hard_to_understand.html">nathan marz storm-2010-02-21-Why so many research papers are so hard to understand</a></p>

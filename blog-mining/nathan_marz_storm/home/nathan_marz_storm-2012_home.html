<p>Introduction: Stormwas open-sourced exactly one year ago today. It's been an action-packed
year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's
happened over the past year:27 companies have publicized that they'reusing
Storm in production. I know of at least a few more companies using it that
haven't published anything yet.O'Reillypublished a bookon Storm.The Storm
mailing list has over 1300 members, with over 500 messages per month.The
@stormprocessor account has over 1200 followers.More than 4000 people have
starred the projecton Github.There's a regular Storm meetup in the Bay Area
with over 230 members. I've also seen lots of Storm-focused meetups happen all
over the world over the past year.29 people all over the world have
contributed to the codebaseWe releasedTrident, a high level abstraction for
realtime computation, that is a major leap forward in what's possible in
realtime.Libraries have been released integrating Storm with Kestrel, Kafka,
JMS, Cassandra, Memcached,</p><p>2 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2012-33" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented_programming.html">nathan marz storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>3 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2012-32" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-01-09-Early_access_edition_of_my_book_is_available.html">nathan marz storm-2012-01-09-Early access edition of my book is available</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Theearly access editionof my bookBig Data: principles and best practices of
scalable realtime data systemsis now available from Manning! I've been working
on this book for quite some time, and I'm excited to have it out there and
start getting some feedback.The interest in the book has already been
overwhelming, and I've been answering questions about iton Hacker News.</p><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this
problem instantly by reclassifying the internet from an "information service"
to a</p><p>2 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2014-40" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-24-The_inexplicable_rise_of_open_floor_plans_in_tech_companies.html">nathan marz storm-2014-02-24-The inexplicable rise of open floor plans in tech companies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: I originally quoted the average price of office space as $36 / square
foot / month, where in reality it's per year. So I was accidentally weakening
my own argument! The post has been updated to reflect the right number.The
"open floor plan" has really taken over tech companies in San Francisco.
Offices are organized as huge open spaces with row after row of tables.
Employees sit next to each other and each have their own piece of desk space.
Now, I don't want to comment on the effectiveness of open floor plans for
fields other than my own. But for software development, this isthe single best
way to sabotage the productivity of your entire engineering team.The
problemProgramming is a very brain-intensive task. You have to hold all sorts
of disparate information in your head at once and synthesize it into extremely
precise code. It requires intense amounts of focus. Distractions and
interruptions are death to the productivity of a programmer. And an open-floor
plan encourages dis</p><p>3 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2014-39" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator â€“ and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><br/><br/><br/>

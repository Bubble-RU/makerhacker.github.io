<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to
the cl</p><p>2 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2011-30" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-03-29-My_talks_at_POSSCON.html">nathan marz storm-2011-03-29-My talks at POSSCON</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week I went to POSSCON in Columbia, South Carolina. It was an interesting
experience and a good reminder that not everyone in the world thinks like we
do in Silicon Valley.I gave two talks at the conference. One was a technical
talk about how to build realtime Big Data systems, and the other was a non-
technical talk about the things we do at BackType to be a super-productive
team. Both slide decks are embedded below.The Secrets of Building Realtime Big
Data SystemsBecome Efficient or Die: The Story of BackType</p><p>3 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2011-29" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-01-19-Inglourious_Software_Patents.html">nathan marz storm-2011-01-19-Inglourious Software Patents</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most articles arguing for the abolishment of software patents focus on how so
many software patents don't meet the "non-obvious and non-trivial" guidelines
for patents. The problem with this approach is that the same argument could be
used to advocate for reform in how software patents are evaluated rather than
the abolishment of software patents altogether.Software patents should be
abolished though, and I'm going to show this with an economic analysis. We'll
see that even non-obvious and non-trivial software patents should never be
granted as they can only cause economic loss.Why do patents exist in the first
place?The patent system exists to provide an incentive for innovationwhere
that incentive would not have existed otherwise.Imagine you're an individual
living in the 19th century. Let's say the patent system does not exist and you
have an idea to make a radically better kind of sewing machine. If you
invested the time to develop your idea into a working invention, the existing

<p>Introduction: I'll be teaching a Cascalog workshop on February 19th at BackType HQ in Union
Square. You can sign up athttp://cascalog.eventbrite.com. Early bird tickets
are available until January 31st.I'm very excited to be teaching this
workshop. Cascalog's tight integration with Clojure opens up a world of
techniques that no other data processing tool is able to do. Even though I
created Cascalog, I've been discovering many of these techniques as I've made
use of Cascalog for more and more varied tasks. Along the way, I've tweaked
Cascalog so that making use of these techniques would be cleaner and more
idiomatic. At this point, after nine months of iteration, Cascalog is a joy to
use for even the most complex tasks. I'm excited to impart this knowledge upon
others in this workshop.</p><p>5 <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2011-27" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-01-07-Analysis_of_the_%23LessAmbitiousMovies_Twitter_Meme.html">nathan marz storm-2011-01-07-Analysis of the #LessAmbitiousMovies Twitter Meme</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We did a fun post on the BackType blog today analyzing a meme that took off on
Twitter this week. A person with about 500 followers started the meme that
eventually reached more than 27 million people. Check out our analysishere,
and you can check out TechCrunch coverage of our analysishere.Doing the
analysis was relatively simple. We extracted an 80 MB dataset of the tweets
involved in the meme from our 25 TB social dataset. We downloaded that data to
a local computer and ran queries on the data from a Clojure REPL
usingCascalog. Doing the data analysis only took us a couple hours.</p><br/><br/><br/>

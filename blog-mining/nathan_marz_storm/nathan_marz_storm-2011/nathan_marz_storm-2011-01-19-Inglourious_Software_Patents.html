<p>Introduction: This is the first in a series of posts on the principles of software
engineering. There's far more to software engineering than just "making
computers do stuff" – while that phrase is accurate, it does not come close to
describing what's involved in making robust, reliable software. I will use my
experience building large scale systems to inform a first principles approach
to defining what it is we do – or should be doing – as software engineers. I'm
not interested in tired debates like dynamic vs. static languages – instead, I
intend to explore the really core aspects of software engineering.The first
order of business is to define what software engineering even is in the first
place. Software engineering is the construction of software that produces some
desired output for some range of inputs. The inputs to software are more than
just method parameters: they include the hardware on which it's running, the

where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>6 0.040685605 <a title="29-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-05-10-Why_we_in_tech_must_support_Lawrence_Lessig.html">41 nathan marz storm-2014-05-10-Why we in tech must support Lawrence Lessig</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this
problem instantly by reclassifying the internet from an "information service"

<p>Introduction: Most articles arguing for the abolishment of software patents focus on how so
many software patents don't meet the "non-obvious and non-trivial" guidelines
for patents. The problem with this approach is that the same argument could be
used to advocate for reform in how software patents are evaluated rather than
the abolishment of software patents altogether.Software patents should be
abolished though, and I'm going to show this with an economic analysis. We'll
see that even non-obvious and non-trivial software patents should never be
granted as they can only cause economic loss.Why do patents exist in the first
place?The patent system exists to provide an incentive for innovationwhere
that incentive would not have existed otherwise.Imagine you're an individual
living in the 19th century. Let's say the patent system does not exist and you
have an idea to make a radically better kind of sewing machine. If you
invested the time to develop your idea into a working invention, the existing

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-
funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business
types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit
obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are
either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the
same:Write a blog.A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it
in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can
do.Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off –
startups aredesperatefor talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to
identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of
candidates.Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's
really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-
inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And
interviews are notorious f</p><p>3 0.13759169 <a title="29-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-05-10-Why_we_in_tech_must_support_Lawrence_Lessig.html">41 nathan marz storm-2014-05-10-Why we in tech must support Lawrence Lessig</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm an entrepreneur and a programmer. I've been fortunate to work in an
industry that has seen incredible growth the past 10 years. It's amazing that
an entrepreneur can launch services that reach millions of people with very,
very small amounts of capital. Startups can compete with established services
on a level playing field because the internet does not discriminate between
different services. The internet is neutral. This has enabled an explosion of
services that has provided massive amounts of value to the entire world.I'm
not here to convince you of the importance of net neutrality. This has been
done thoroughlyhere,here,here, andhere. Instead I want to talk about a much
deeper issue.Losing net neutrality would be extremely harmful to our society
and our economy, and it's not hard to see this. And yet, the government seems
to have a lot of trouble understanding this. The government could fix this
problem instantly by reclassifying the internet from an "information service"
to a</p><p>4 0.13392685 <a title="29-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented_programming.html">33 nathan marz storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>5 0.13271582 <a title="29-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-05-How_to_get_a_job_at_a_kick-ass_startup_%28for_programmers%29.html">22 nathan marz storm-2010-10-05-How to get a job at a kick-ass startup (for programmers)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking

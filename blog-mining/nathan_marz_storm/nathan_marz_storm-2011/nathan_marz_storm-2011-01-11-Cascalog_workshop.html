techniques that no other data processing tool is able to do. Even though I
created Cascalog, I've been discovering many of these techniques as I've made
use of Cascalog for more and more varied tasks. Along the way, I've tweaked
Cascalog so that making use of these techniques would be cleaner and more
idiomatic. At this point, after nine months of iteration, Cascalog is a joy to

<p>Introduction: In thefirst tutorialforCascalog, I showed off many of Cascalog's powerful
features: joins, aggregates, subqueries, custom operations, and more. Since
Cascalog's release a couple weeks ago, I've added a number of new features to
Cascalog that seriously increase the expressiveness and performance of the
language without compromising its simplicity or flexibility.Like the first
tutorial, go ahead and load up the playground by issuing the following
commands:lein compile-java && lein compilelein repluser=> (use
'cascalog.playground) (bootstrap)moreOuter joinsAs we saw in the first
tutorial, you can join together multiple sources of data in Cascalog by using
the same variable name in multiple sources of data. For example, given "age"
and "gender" sources, we can get the age and gender for each person by
running:user=> (?<\- (stdout) [?person ?age ?gender](age ?person ?age) (gender
?person ?gender))This is aninner join. We will only have results for people
that appear in both sets of data.

<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly

resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and

for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be

<p>Introduction: I'll be teaching a Cascalog workshop on February 19th at BackType HQ in Union
Square. You can sign up athttp://cascalog.eventbrite.com. Early bird tickets
are available until January 31st.I'm very excited to be teaching this
workshop. Cascalog's tight integration with Clojure opens up a world of
techniques that no other data processing tool is able to do. Even though I
created Cascalog, I've been discovering many of these techniques as I've made
use of Cascalog for more and more varied tasks. Along the way, I've tweaked
Cascalog so that making use of these techniques would be cleaner and more
idiomatic. At this point, after nine months of iteration, Cascalog is a joy to
use for even the most complex tasks. I'm excited to impart this knowledge upon
others in this workshop.</p><p>2 0.99161667 <a title="28-lda-2" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-09-19-Storm%27s_1st_birthday.html">34 nathan marz storm-2012-09-19-Storm's 1st birthday</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stormwas open-sourced exactly one year ago today. It's been an action-packed
year for Storm, to say the least. Here's some of the exciting stuff that's
happened over the past year:27 companies have publicized that they'reusing
Storm in production. I know of at least a few more companies using it that
haven't published anything yet.O'Reillypublished a bookon Storm.The Storm
mailing list has over 1300 members, with over 500 messages per month.The
@stormprocessor account has over 1200 followers.More than 4000 people have
starred the projecton Github.There's a regular Storm meetup in the Bay Area
with over 230 members. I've also seen lots of Storm-focused meetups happen all
over the world over the past year.29 people all over the world have
contributed to the codebaseWe releasedTrident, a high level abstraction for
realtime computation, that is a major leap forward in what's possible in
realtime.Libraries have been released integrating Storm with Kestrel, Kafka,
JMS, Cassandra, Memcached,</p><p>3 0.22209111 <a title="28-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-04-Introducing_%22Nanny%22_-_a_really_simple_dependency_management_tool.html">7 nathan marz storm-2010-03-04-Introducing "Nanny" - a really simple dependency management tool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dependency management in software projects is a pretty simple problem when you
think about it. A tool to manage dependencies just needs to do three
things:Provide a mechanism to specify the direct dependencies to a
projectDownload the transitive closure of dependencies to a projectPublish
packages that can be used as a dependency to other projectsSome languages have
good dependency management systems - for example, rubygems. Others, like Java,
have tools like Maven which I would call a complex solution to a simple
problem. You shouldn't need to buy abookto understand the solution to such a
simple problem. Plus, these dependency management systems are all language
specific.I've seen companies do crazy things to manage their dependencies. One
company, to manage their jar files, would put all the jars that any project
might need in a special "jars" project. You would then need to setup a
JARS_HOME environment variable and be sure to update the jars project if you
need any of the dependenc</p><p>4 0.17938757 <a title="28-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what
kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for
unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's
alsofantasticfor strongly typed, structured data.In this post I'll discuss how
you can use a tool likeThriftto store strongly typed data in Hadoop while
retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based
schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based
applications.OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in
Hadoop?Anything! AtBackTypewe put data about news, conversations, and people
into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information
about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop.
That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data
format?JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data
inconsistency. For example, if you</p><p>5 0.17810319 <a title="28-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-24-The_inexplicable_rise_of_open_floor_plans_in_tech_companies.html">40 nathan marz storm-2014-02-24-The inexplicable rise of open floor plans in tech companies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: I originally quoted the average price of office space as $36 / square
foot / month, where in reality it's per year. So I was accidentally weakening
my own argument! The post has been updated to reflect the right number.The
"open floor plan" has really taken over tech companies in San Francisco.
Offices are organized as huge open spaces with row after row of tables.
Employees sit next to each other and each have their own piece of desk space.
Now, I don't want to comment on the effectiveness of open floor plans for
fields other than my own. But for software development, this isthe single best
way to sabotage the productivity of your entire engineering team.The
problemProgramming is a very brain-intensive task. You have to hold all sorts
of disparate information in your head at once and synthesize it into extremely
precise code. It requires intense amounts of focus. Distractions and
interruptions are death to the productivity of a programmer. And an open-floor
plan encourages dis</p><p>6 0.16425484 <a title="28-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>

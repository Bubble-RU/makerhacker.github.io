<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator â€“ and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

<p>Introduction: Yesterday was my last day at Twitter. I left to start my own company. What
I'll be working on is very exciting (though I'm keeping it secret for
now).Leaving Twitter was a tough decision. I worked with a whole bunch of
great people on fascinating problems with some of the most interesting data in
the world. Ultimately though, I felt that if I didn't make this move, I
wouldregret itfor the rest of my life. So I put in my papers about a month ago
and then spent a month transitioning my team for my departure.This ends an
eventful three years that started with me joining BackType in January of 2010.
So much has happened in these past three years. I open-
sourcedCascalog,ElephantDB, andStorm, started writinga book, gavea lot of
talks, and in July of 2011 experienced the thrill ofbeing acquired. My
projects spread beyond BackType and Twitter to be relied on bydozens and
dozens of companies. Through all this, I learned an enormous amount about
entrepreneurship, product development, marketing,</p><p>5 0.09391652 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2012/nathan_marz_storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented_programming.html">33 nathan marz storm-2012-02-06-Suffering-oriented programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone asked me an interesting question the other day: "How did you justify
taking such a huge risk on buildingStormwhile working on astartup?" (Storm is
a realtime computation system). I can see how from an outsider's perspective
investing in such a massive project seems extremely risky for a startup. From
my perspective, though, building Storm wasn't risky at all. It was
challenging, but not risky.I follow a style of development that greatly
reduces the risk of big projects like Storm. I call this style "suffering-
oriented programming." Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like
so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it. It
applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday
programming decisions. Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by
ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures
that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large
investment.I have a mantra</p><p>6 0.086824507 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-07-12-My_experience_as_the_first_employee_of_a_Y_Combinator_startup.html">19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: Last week I went to POSSCON in Columbia, South Carolina. It was an interesting
experience and a good reminder that not everyone in the world thinks like we
do in Silicon Valley.I gave two talks at the conference. One was a technical
talk about how to build realtime Big Data systems, and the other was a non-
technical talk about the things we do at BackType to be a super-productive
team. Both slide decks are embedded below.The Secrets of Building Realtime Big

<p>Introduction: Most people flee uncertainty. Yet being able to think well under uncertainty
can be very rewarding, and I've come to realize it's a skill that can be
learned. Here are some tips for thinking under uncertainty.1. Think in terms
of ranges of scenariosIn many situations, you only have limited information.
Our brains are quick to make conclusions and don't consider all the
scenarios.Don't let this happen.You have to realize that given the information
you have, there is a range of scenarios that could account for it.Talking to
someone who seems cold and aloof? Maybe the person is unfriendly, or maybe the
person is justshy.Is your boss micromanaging you lately? Maybe he doesn't
trust you, maybe he's under increased pressure fromhisboss, or maybe it's just
a random event.You need to avoid tunnel vision. It's easy to become focused on
one scenario - because you're afraid of the scenario or really hopeful for it
- and ignore information that points to other possibilities.For each decision

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator â€“ and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>4 0.2539781 <a title="30-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-01-13-Mimi_Silbert%3A_the_greatest_hacker_in_the_world.html">3 nathan marz storm-2010-01-13-Mimi Silbert: the greatest hacker in the world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a problem for you: build an organization that transforms thousands of
homeless people, ex-cons, and recovering drug addicts into productive members
of society.OK,now do it with no money and no staff. And achieve a >90% success
rate. While you're at it, make the organization double as a business that
provides valuable services to the community. And make the whole thing self-
sustaining.Amazingly, Mimi Silbert accomplishedthis very feat. She's been at
it for 35 years and her organization is called theDelancey Street Foundation.
I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I could find about how
Delancey Street operates, and simply put, it's the most spectacular and
innovative organization I've ever come across.At the highest level, Delancey
Street is a stunning example of social entrepreneurship. Residents work in
Delancey Street's numerous training schools, such as theirmoving
companyandrestaurant. These businesses give the residents marketable skills
and also generate</p><p>5 0.2258724 <a title="30-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2011/nathan_marz_storm-2011-10-13-How_to_beat_the_CAP_theorem.html">31 nathan marz storm-2011-10-13-How to beat the CAP theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability,
and partition-tolerance at the same time. But you can't sacrifice partition-
tolerance (seehereandhere), so you must make a tradeoff between availability
and consistency. Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL
movement.Consistency means that after you do a successful write, future reads
will always take that write into account. Availability means that you can
always read and write to the system. During a partition, you can only have one
of these properties.Systems that choose consistency over availability have to
deal with some awkward issues. What do you do when the database isn't
available? You can try buffering writes for later, but you risk losing those
writes if you lose the machine with the buffer. Also, buffering writes can be
a form of inconsistency because a client thinks a write has succeeded but the
write isn't in the database yet. Alternatively, you can return errors back to

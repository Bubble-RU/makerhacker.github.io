<p>Introduction: 7. Which of the following statements accurately summarize claims made by Page and Shapiro in The Rational Public and their associated research articles? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) Americans’ attitudes on policy alternatives are highly unstable over time, reflecting a rational response to unstable political conditions.
 
(b) When studying public opinion, question-wording is less important than scholars have traditionally thought.
 
(c) Attitudes about foreign policy change more abruptly than attitudes on domestic issues.
 
(d) The contents of the mass media account for a high proportion of opinion changes on foreign policy.
 
(e) Using the assumption of rationality, Page and Shapiro fit a hedonic regression to estimate the underlying utility function of survey respondents.
 
(f) Page and Shapiro use the term “rational” ironically; their fundamental claim is that Americans are easily distracted and that rational-public models are seriously flawed.

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

<p>Introduction: David Shor writes:
  
I’m fitting a state-space model right now that estimates the “design effect” of individual pollsters (Ratio of poll variance to that predicted by perfect random sampling). What would be a good prior distribution for that?
  
My quickest suggestion is start with something simple, such as a uniform from 1 to 10, and then to move to something hierarchical, such as a lognormal on (design.effect – 1), with the hyperparameters estimated from data.
 
My longer suggestion is to take things apart.  What exactly do you mean by “design effect”?  There are lots of things going on, both in sampling error (the classical “design effect” that comes from cluster sampling, stratification, weighting, etc.) and nonsampling error (nonresponse bias, likeliy voter screening, bad questions, etc.)  It would be best if you could model both pieces.</p><p>6 0.13198294 <a title="1323-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-06-Question_27_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1368 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-06-Question 27 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).


I would love for you (and anyone you’d like to</p><p>2 0.97459298 <a title="1323-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written_slam_on_moderately_celebrated_writers_is_amusing_nonetheless.html">204 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written slam on moderately celebrated writers is amusing nonetheless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .
 
The other thing I noticed</p><p>3 0.97445977 <a title="1323-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-24-Trends_in_partisanship_by_state.html">536 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-24-Trends in partisanship by state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.
 
P.S.  Perhaps this will clarify:  In a typical economics research pap</p><p>5 0.96762586 <a title="1323-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

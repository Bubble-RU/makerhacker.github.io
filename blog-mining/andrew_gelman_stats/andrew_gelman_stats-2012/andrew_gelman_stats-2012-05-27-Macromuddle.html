<p>Introduction: This news article  by Ryan Tate is an amazing bit of sociology:
  
If you want Facebook to spend millions of dollars hiring you, it helps to be a talented engineer, as the New York Times today [18 May 2011] suggests. But it also helps to carouse with Facebook honchos, invite them to your dad’s Mediterranean party palace, and get them introduced to your father’s venture capital pals, like Sam Lessin did.


Lessin is the poster boy for today’s Times story on Facebook “talent acquisitions.” Facebook spent several million dollars to buy Lessin’s drop.io, only to shut it down and put Lessin to work on internal projects. To the Times, Lessin is an example of how “the best talent” fetches tons of money these days. “Engineers are worth half a million to one million,” a Facebook executive told the paper.


We’ll let you in on a few things the Times left out: Lessin is not an engineer, but a Harvard social studies major and a former Bain consultant.

<p>Introduction: I was reading this  news article  by famed business reporter James Stewart: 
  
  
Measured by market capitalization, Apple is the world’s biggest public company. . . . Sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 . . . totaled $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from the year before. Earnings more than doubled. . . . Here is the rub: Apple is so big, it’s running up against the law of large numbers.
  
Huh?  At this point I sat up, curious.  Stewart continued:
  
Also known as the golden theorem, with a proof attributed to the 17th-century Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the law states that a variable will revert to a mean over a large sample of results. In the case of the largest companies, it suggests that high earnings growth and a rapid rise in share price will slow as those companies grow ever larger.


If Apple’s share price grew even 20 percent a year for the next decade, which is far below its current blistering pace, its $500 billion market capitalization would be more than $3 tri</p><p>4 0.11464635 <a title="1347-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-28-Thoughts_on_Groseclose_book_on_media_bias.html">828 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-28-Thoughts on Groseclose book on media bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Respected political scientist Tim Groseclose just came out with a book, “Left Turn:  How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.”  I was familiar with Groseclose’s article (with Jeffrey Milyo) on media bias that came out several years ago–it was an interesting study but I was not convinced by its central claim that they were measuring an absolute level of bias–and then recently heard about this new book in the context of some  intemperate  things Groseclose said in a interview on the conservative Fox TV network.
 
Groseclose’s big conclusion is that in the absence of media bias, the average American voter would be positioned at around 25 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is a right-wing Republican and 100 is a left-wing Democrat.  (Seeing as the number line is conventionally drawn from left to right, I think it would make more sense for 0 to represent the left and 100 to be on the right, but I guess it’s too late for him to change now.)  Groseclose places the average voter now at around</p><p>5 0.1128133 <a title="1347-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-22-Krugman_sets_the_bar_too_high.html">1733 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-22-Krugman sets the bar too high</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of my left-wing colleagues pointed me to  this  Fox TV interview in which UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose expresses displeasure with having his research criticized by liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America.
 
My colleague thought it was irresponsible and unprofessional for Groseclose to get all indignant about the criticism.  But I understood.  I remember how after the state Attorney General’s office released the study Jeff Fagan and I did on police stops ( see here  for the research-paper version), we were viciously attacked.  Some creep from the NYC Law Department sent a nasty letter full of accusations that were . . . I’d say “bullshit” but I don’t want to say that because “bullshit” contains the word “shit” and I don’t want to use profanity on this blog . . . anyway, this lawyer creep sent us an aggressive letter with bogus claims about our research competence.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an  article  by Riccardo Puglisi, who writes:
  

Controlling for the activity of the incumbent president and the U.S. Congress across issues, I find that during a presidential campaign, The New York Times gives more emphasis to topics on which the Democratic party is perceived as more competent (civil rights, health care, labor and social welfare) when the incumbent president is a Republican. This is consistent with the hypothesis that The New York Times has a Democratic partisanship, with some “anti-incumbent” aspects . . . consistent with The New York Times departing from demand-driven news coverage.

  
I haven’t read the article in the question but the claim seems plausible to me.  I’ve often thought there is an asymmetry in media bias, with Democratic reporters–a survey a few years ago found that twice as many journalists identify as Democrats than as Republicans–biasing their reporting by choosing which topics to focus on, and Republican news organization</p><p>5 0.69165212 <a title="1347-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Unsurprisingly%2C_people_are_more_worried_about_the_economy_and_jobs_than_about_deficits.html">100 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Unsurprisingly, people are more worried about the economy and jobs than about deficits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Lax sends along  this  good catch from Ben Somberg, who noticed  this  from Washington Post writer Lori Montgomery:
  
If Congress doesn’t provide additional stimulus spending, economists inside and outside the administration warn that the nation risks a prolonged period of high unemployment or, more frightening, a descent back into recession. But a competing threat — the exploding federal budget deficit — seems to be resonating more powerfully in Congress and among voters.
  
Somberg is skeptical, though, at least of the part about “resonating among voters.”  He finds that in four out of five recent polls, people are much more concerned about jobs than about the deficit:
  
 
A Pew Research / National Journal poll from early June asked “Which of the following national economic issues worries you most?” Number one was “job situation” with 41%. “Federal budget deficit” got 23%.

I just wanted to alert to this completely misinformed Politico article by Roger Simon, equating sampling theory with “magic.” Normally, I wouldn’t send you this, but I sent him a helpful email and he was a complete jerk about it.
  
Wow—this is really bad. It’s so bad I refuse to link to it. I don’t know who this dude is, but it’s pitiful. Andy Rooney could do better. And I don’t mean Andy Rooney in his prime, I mean Andy Rooney right now. The piece appears to be an attempt at jocularity, but it’s about 10 million times worse than whatever the worst thing is that Dave Barry has ever written.
 
My question to Neil Malhotra is . . . what made you click on this in the first place?

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Kaul wrotes:
  
By statute (“the least burdensome” pathway), the approval standard for devices by the US FDA is lower than for drugs. Before a new drug can be marketed, the sponsor must show “substantial evidence of effectiveness” as based on two or more well-controlled clinical studies (which literally means 2 trials, each with a p value of <0.05, or 1 large trial with a robust p value <0.00125). In contrast, the sponsor of a new device, especially those that are designated as high-risk (Class III) device, need only demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to an FDA-approved device via the 510(k) exemption or a "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness", evaluated through a pre-market approval and typically based on a single study.


What does “reasonable assurance” or “substantial equivalence” imply to you as a Bayesian? These are obviously qualitative constructs, but if one were to quantify them, how would you go about addressing it?

The Centre for Multilevel Modelling at the University of Bristol is seeking to appoint an applied statistician to work on a new ESRC-funded project, Longitudinal Effects, Multilevel Modelling and Applications (LEMMA 3). LEMMA 3 is one of six Nodes of the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). The LEMMA 3 Node will focus on methods for the analysis of longitudinal data.


The appointment, at Research Assistant or Research Associate level, will be for 2.5 years with likelihood of extension to the end of September 2014.

By “modelling,” I think he means “modeling.”  And by “centre,” I think he means “center.”  But I think you get the basic idea.

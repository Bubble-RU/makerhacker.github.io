<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).
  
I agree that (a) the graph could be improved in small ways–in particular, adding half-year data seems like a great idea–and (b) it’s a wonderful, wonderful graph as is.  And the NYT graphics people ad</p><p>5 0.80094451 <a title="1357-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-15-World_record_running_times_vs._distance.html">1011 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-15-World record running times vs. distance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Julyan Arbel  plots  world record running times vs. distance (on the log-log scale):
 
   
 
The line has a slope of 1.1.  I think it would be clearer to plot speed vs. distance—then you’d get a slope of -0.1, and the numbers would be more directly interpretable.
 
Indeed,  this paper  by Sandra Savaglio and Vincenzo Carbone (referred to in the comments on Julyan’s blog) plots speed vs. time.  Graphing by speed gives more resolution:
 
   
 
The upper-left graph in the grid corresponds to the human running records plotted by Arbel.  It’s funny that Arbel sees only one line whereas Savaglio and Carbone see two—but if you remove the 100m record at one end and the 100km at the other end, you can see two lines in Arbel’s graph as well.  The bottom two graphs show swimming records.   Knut  would probably have something to say about all this.</p><p>6 0.79853129 <a title="1357-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-One_more_time-use_graph.html">671 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-One more time-use graph</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.


Four outliers were excl</p><p>2 0.95532489 <a title="1357-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-09-Varying_treatment_effects%2C_again.html">1310 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-09-Varying treatment effects, again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This time  from  Bernard Fraga and Eitan Hersh.  Once you think about it, it’s hard to imagine any nonzero treatment effects that don’t vary.  I’m glad to see this area of research becoming more prominent.  ( Here ‘s a discussion of another political science example, also of voter turnout, from a few years ago, from Avi Feller and Chris Holmes.)
 
Some of my fragmentary work on varying treatment effects is  here  (Treatment Effects in Before-After Data) and  here  (Estimating Incumbency Advantage and Its Variation, as an Example of a Before–After Study).</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94797426 <a title="1357-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-01-Halloween-Valentine%E2%80%99s_update.html">1357 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-01-Halloween-Valentine’s update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago we  reported  on a claim that more babies are born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween.
 
At the time, I wrote that I’d like to see a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.
 
Joshua Gans sent along the following from an unpublished appendix to his paper.  It’s not the graph I was asking for but it does supply additional information beyond those two holidays.  Click to enlarge:
 
   
 
   
 
I don’t know what all those digits are doing (do you really need to know that an estimate is “-70.856″ if its standard error is “10.640″?  I’d think that “-71 +/- 10 would be just fine), but I suppose the careful reader can ignore the numbers and simply read the signs and the stars.  In any case, it’s good to see more data.</p><p>4 0.94569367 <a title="1357-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-22-Tenants_and_landlords.html">158 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-22-Tenants and landlords</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.
 
2.  A year after I graduated, the landlord actually did sell the place but then, when my friends moved out, he refused to pay back their security deposit.  There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.  So they sued the landlord in Mass. housing court</p><p>5 0.93736279 <a title="1357-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-14-Extra_babies_on_Valentine%E2%80%99s_Day%2C_fewer_on_Halloween%3F.html">1167 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-14-Extra babies on Valentine’s Day, fewer on Halloween?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just in time for the holiday, X  pointed  me to  an article  by Becca Levy, Pil Chung, and Martin Slade reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days: 
   
 
What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year.  It would be easy enough to make.  That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.  While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates.  It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.
 
The data are publicly available, so maybe someone could make those graphs?  If the Valentine’s/Halloween data are worth publishing, I think more comprehensive graphs should be publishable as well.  I’d post them here, that’s for sure.</p><p>6 0.92842495 <a title="1357-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-10-Translating_into_Votes%3A_The_Electoral_Impact_of_Spanish-Language_Ballots.html">406 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-10-Translating into Votes: The Electoral Impact of Spanish-Language Ballots</a></p>

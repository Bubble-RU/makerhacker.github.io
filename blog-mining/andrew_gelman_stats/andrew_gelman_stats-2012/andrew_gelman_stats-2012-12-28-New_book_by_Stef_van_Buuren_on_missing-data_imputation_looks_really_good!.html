<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  reviews  a recent book, “Lifecyle Investing,” by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff, two professors of management at Yale.  The book recommends that young adults take out loans to buy stocks and then hold these stocks for many years to prepare for retirement.
 
What I’m wondering is:  What’s the goal of writing this sort of book?  The main audience has got to be young adults (and their parents) who are already pretty well fixed, financially.  Students at Yale, for example.  And the book must be intended for people who are already beyond the standard recommendations of personal-investment books (pay off your credit card debt, don’t waste so much money on restaurant meals and fancy clothes, buy 1 used car instead of 2 new ones, etc).  Basically it sounds like they’re talking to people who have a lot of money but want to make sure that they retire rich rather than merely middle-class.
 
I can’t say that I’m morally opposed to helping the rich get richer.  After all, I’m not out the</p><p>4 0.13204417 <a title="1642-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-12-Single_or_multiple_imputation%3F.html">608 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-12-Single or multiple imputation?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vishnu Ganglani writes:
  
It appears that multiple imputation appears to be the best way to impute missing data because of the more accurate quantification of variance. However, when imputing missing data for income values in national household surveys, would you recommend it would be practical to maintain the multiple datasets associated with multiple imputations, or a single imputation method would suffice. I have worked on household survey projects (in Scotland) and in the past gone with suggesting single methods for ease of implementation, but with the availability of open source R software I am think of performing multiple imputation methodologies, but a bit apprehensive because of the complexity and also the need to maintain multiple datasets (ease of implementation).
  
My reply:  In many applications I’ve just used a single random imputation to avoid the awkwardness of working with multiple datasets.  But if there’s any concern, I’d recommend doing parallel analyses on multipl</p><p>5 0.12989923 <a title="1642-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

<p>Introduction: Ben points us to a new book,  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data .  It’s excellent and I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth the $89.95.  Van Buuren’s book is great even if you don’t end up using the algorithm described in the book (I actually like their approach but I do think there are some limitations with their particular implementation, which is one reason we’re developing our own  package ); he supplies lots of intuition, examples, and graphs. 
   
P.S.  Stef’s book features an introduction by Don Rubin, which gets me thinking:  if Don can find the time to write an introduction to somebody else’s book, he surely should be willing to read and comment on the third edition of his own book, no?</p><p>2 0.96883446 <a title="1642-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-31-Value-added_modeling_in_education%3A__Gaming_the_system_by_sending_kids_on_a_field_trip_at_test_time.html">2083 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-31-Value-added modeling in education:  Gaming the system by sending kids on a field trip at test time</a></p>

In my book “Uneducated Guesses” in the chapter on value-added models, I discuss how the treatment of missing data can have a profound effect on the estimates of teacher scores. I made up how a principal might send the best students on a field trip at the beginning of the year when the ‘pre-test’ was given (and their scores would be imputed from the students who showed up) and that the bottom half of the class would have a matching field trip on the day of the post test. Everyone laughed.


But apparently someone decided to take it seriously.

<p>Introduction: The pre-NYT David Brooks liked to make fun of the NYT.  Here’s one  from 1997 :
  
I’m not sure I’d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I’d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.


And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man—Thomas Arena—who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .


These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan’s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.

Are you familiar with Miller and Chapman’s (2001)  article : Misunderstanding Analysis of Covariance saying that ANCOVA (and therefore, I suppose regression) should not be used when groups differ on a covariate.    It has caused a moderate splash in psychology circles.  I wondered if you had any thoughts on it.
  
I had not heard of the article so I followed the link . . . ugh!  Already on the very first column of the very first page they confuse nonadditivity with nonlinearity.  I could probably continue with, “and it gets worse,” but since nobody’s paying me to read this one, I’ll stop reading right there on the first page!

<p>Introduction: Majid Ezzati writes:
  
My research group is increasingly focusing on a series of problems that involve data that either have missingness or measurements that may have bias/error.  We have at times developed our own approaches to imputation (as simple as interpolating a missing unit and as sophisticated as a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model) and at other times, other groups impute the data. 


The outputs are being used to investigate the basic associations between pairs of variables, Xs and Ys, in regressions; we may or may not interpret these as causal.  I am contacting colleagues with relevant expertise to suggest good references on whether having imputed X and/or Y in a subsequent regression is correct or if it could somehow lead to biased/spurious associations.   Thinking about this, we can have at least the following situations (these could all be Bayesian or not):


1)  X and Y both measured (perhaps with error)

<p>Introduction: David Radwin asks a question which comes up fairly often in one form or another:
  
How should one respond to requests for statistical hypothesis tests for population (or universe) data?


I [Radwin] first encountered this issue as an undergraduate when a professor suggested a statistical significance test for my paper comparing roll call votes between freshman and veteran members of Congress. Later I learned that such tests apply only to samples because their purpose is to tell you whether the difference in the observed sample is likely to exist in the population. If you have data for the whole population, like all members of the 103rd House of Representatives, you do not need a test to discern the true difference in the population. 


Sometimes researchers assume some sort of superpopulation like “all possible Congresses” or “Congresses across all time” and that the members of any given Congress constitute a sample.

<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>4 0.10998408 <a title="1511-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Examining_US_Legislative_process_with_%E2%80%9CMany_Bills%E2%80%9D.html">764 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Examining US Legislative process with “Many Bills”</a></p>

A couple of months ago, you were visiting the University of Groningen, and after the talk you gave there I spoke briefly with you about a study that I conducted with Richard Morey, Jeff Rouder and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers. In the study, we found that researchers’  knowledge of how to interpret a confidence interval (CI), was almost as limited as the knowledge of students who had had no inferential statistics course yet. Our manuscript was recently accepted for publication in  Psychonomic Bulletin & Review , and it’s now available online (see e.g.,  here ). Maybe it’s interesting to discuss on your blog, especially since CIs are often promoted (for example in the new guidelines of Psychological Science ), but apparently researchers seem to have little idea how to interpret them. Given that the confidence percentage of a CI tells something about the procedure rather than about the data at hand, this might be understandable, but, according to us, it’s problematic neve</p><p>6 0.093528152 <a title="1511-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-This_is_a_link_to_a_news_article_about_a_scientific_paper.html">302 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-This is a link to a news article about a scientific paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I recently wrote  something  on the much-discussed OK Cupid analysis of political attitudes of a huge sample of people in their dating database.  My quick comment was that their analysis was interesting, but participants on an online dating site must certainly be far from a random sample of Americans.
 
But suppose I want to not just criticize but also think in a positive direction.  OK Cupid’s database is huge, and one thing statistical methods are good at–Bayesian methods in particular–is combining a huge amount of noisy, biased data with a smaller amount of good data.  This is what we did in our radon study, using a high-quality survey of 5000 houses in 125 counties to calibrate a set of crappier surveys totaling 80,000 houses in 3000 counties.
 
How would it work for OK Cupid?  We’d want to take their data and poststratify on:
 
Age 
Sex 
Marital/family status 
Education 
Income 
Partisanship 
Ideology 
Political participation 
Religion and religious attendance 
State

<p>Introduction: Mark Blumenthal writes: 
  
  
What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW.

<p>Introduction: I’m involved (with Irv Garfinkel and others) in a planned survey of New York City residents.  It’s hard to reach people in the city–not everyone will answer their mail or phone, and you can’t send an interviewer door-to-door in a locked apartment building.  (I think it violates IRB to have a plan of pushing all the buzzers by the entrance and hoping someone will let you in.)  So the plan is to use multiple modes, including phone, in person household, random street intercepts and mail.
 
The question then is how to combine these samples.  My suggested approach is to divide the population into poststrata based on various factors (age, ethnicity, family type, housing type, etc), then to pool responses within each poststratum, then to runs some regressions including postratsta and also indicators for mode, to understand how respondents from different modes differ, after controlling for the demographic/geographic adjustments.
 
Maybe this has already been done and written up somewhere?

I was just going through the latest draft of  your paper with Anthony Unwin . I heard part of it at  the talk  you gave (remotely) here at UMich.  I’m curious about your discussion of the  Baby Name Voyager .


The tool in itself is simple, attractive, and useful.  No argument from me there.  It’s an awesome demonstration of how subtle interactions can be very helpful (click and it zooms, type and it filters… falls perfectly into the Shneiderman visualization mantra). It satisfies a very common use case: finding appropriate names for children.


That said, I can’t help but feeling that what you are really excited about is  the very static analysis on last letters  (you spend most of your time on this).  This analysis, incidentally, is not possible to infer from the interactive application (which doesn’t support this type of filtering and pivoting).  In a sense, the two visualizations don’t have anything to do with each other (other than a shared context/dataset).</p><p>2 0.93801039 <a title="1511-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-10-%E2%80%9CVersatile%2C_affordable_chicken_has_grown_in_popularity%E2%80%9D.html">655 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-10-“Versatile, affordable chicken has grown in popularity”</a></p>

Hipmunk now includes American Airlines in our search results. Please note that users will be taken directly to AA.com to complete the booking/transaction. . . . we are steadily increasing the number of flights that we offer on Hipmunk.
  
As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.  The regular Amtrak website is about as horrible as you’d expect.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92731875 <a title="1511-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-26-What_do_statistical_p-values_mean_when_the_sample_%3D_the_population%3F.html">1511 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-26-What do statistical p-values mean when the sample = the population?</a></p>

I have many friends working with data that they claim to be considered as a ‘population’. For example, the universe of bills presented in a Congress, the roll call votes of all deputies in a legislature, a survey with all deputies in a country, the outcomes of an election, or the set of electoral institutions around the world. Because of the nature of these data, we do not know how to interpret the p-value. I have seen many arguments been made, but I have never seen a formal response to the question. So I don’t know what to say. The most common arguments among the community of young researchers in Brazil are: (1) don’t interpret p-value when you have population, but don’t infer anything either; (2) interpret the p-value because of error measurement which is also present, (3) there is no such a thing as a population, so always look at p-values, (4) don’t worry about p-value, interpret the coefficients substantively, and (5) if you are frequentist you interpret p-</p><p>6 0.92509151 <a title="1511-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-24-Differences_in_color_perception_by_sex%2C_also_the_Bechdel_test_for_women_in_movies.html">161 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-24-Differences in color perception by sex, also the Bechdel test for women in movies</a></p>

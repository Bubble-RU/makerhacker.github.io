<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: Hogg writes:
  
At the end  this article  you wonder about consistency.  Have you ever considered the possibility that utility might resolve some of the problems?  I have no idea if it 
would—I am not advocating that position—I just get some kind of intuition from phrases like “Judgment is required to decide…”. Perhaps there is a coherent and objective description of what is—or could be—done under a coherent “utility” model (like a utility that could be objectively agreed upon and computed).  Utilities are usually subjective—true—but priors are usually subjective too.
  
My reply:
 
I’m happy to think about utility, for some particular problem or class of problems going to the effort of assigning costs and benefits to different outcomes.  I agree that a utility analysis, even if (necessarily) imperfect, can usefully focus discussion.  For example, if a statistical method for selecting variables is justified on the basis of cost, I like the idea of attempting to quantify the costs of ga</p><p>4 0.11418144 <a title="1471-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-06-Some_economists_are_skeptical_about_microfoundations.html">1200 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-06-Some economists are skeptical about microfoundations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.

Perhaps this will clarify:  In a typical economics research pap</p><p>5 0.1074053 <a title="1471-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-07-Challenges_of_experimental_design%3B_also_another_rant_on_the_practice_of_mentioning_the_publication_of_an_article_but_not_naming_its_author.html">399 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-07-Challenges of experimental design; also another rant on the practice of mentioning the publication of an article but not naming its author</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).

<p>Introduction: Peter Thall writes:
  
Some years ago, after I gave a talk at Columbia that you attended, you told me that you would like to see a decision-theoretic analysis formulated and carried out to completion by Donald Berry, who had been quite vocal for some time about the importance of such a “fully Bayesian” analysis.


I do not work with Berry.  But, in recent years  I have begun to do utility-based clinical trial design.  The trial described in  the attached paper  [by Thall and Hoang Nguyen] enrolled its first child very recently.  While the methodology is not terribly sophisticated, I consider this to be one of the most ethical trials that I have designed.  The utility was elicited from the two trial PIs.  When we had the pre-trial start-up meeting, a third oncologist looked hard at the utility table, and he said that he agreed completely with the numerical utilities. 


I doubt that this trial will cure this type of brain tumor, but I do think that the design gives the children a better</p><p>2 0.87852973 <a title="1471-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-19-Retraction_watch.html">1770 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-19-Retraction watch</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

Gronke et al. write (as excerpted by Sides):
  
Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.
  
Gronke et al. attribute confusion of beliefs to the so-called false consensus effect studied by cognitive psychologists, in which people tend to assume th</p><p>5 0.79126793 <a title="1471-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-17-NUTS_discussed_on_Xi%E2%80%99an%E2%80%99s_Og.html">1809 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-17-NUTS discussed on Xi’an’s Og</a></p>

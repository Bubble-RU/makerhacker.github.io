<p>Introduction: Joe Fruehwald writes:
  
I’m working with linguistic data, specifically binomial hits and misses of a certain variable for certain words (specifically whether or not the “t” sound was pronounced at the end of words like “soft”). Word frequency follows a power law, with most words appearing just once, and with some words being hyperfrequent. I’m not interested in specific word effects, but I am interested in the effect of word frequency.


A logistic model fit is going to be heavily influenced by the effect of the hyperfrequent words which constitute only one type. To control for the item effect, I would fit a multilevel model with a random intercept by word, but like I said, most of the words appear only once.


Is there a principled approach to this problem?
  
My response:  It’s ok to fit a multilevel model even if most groups only have one observation each.  You’ll want to throw in some word-level predictors too.  Think of the multilevel model not as a substitute for the usual thoug</p><p>4 0.12825772 <a title="1191-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-A_defense_of_Tom_Wolfe_based_on_the_impossibility_of_the_law_of_small_numbers_in_network_structure.html">1615 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-A defense of Tom Wolfe based on the impossibility of the law of small numbers in network structure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.
 
Now consider how</p><p>5 0.11844701 <a title="1191-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-14-%E2%80%9CThe_best_data_visualizations_should_stand_on_their_own%E2%80%9D%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_so..html">574 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-14-“The best data visualizations should stand on their own”?

<p>Introduction: Jimmy pointed me to  this  blog by Drew Conway on word clouds.  I don’t have much to say about Conway’s specifics–word clouds aren’t really my thing, but I’m glad that people are thinking about how to do them better–but I did notice one phrase of his that I’ll dispute.  Conway writes
  
The best data visualizations should stand on their own . . .
  
I disagree.  I prefer the saying, “A picture plus 1000 words is better than two pictures or 2000 words.”  That is, I see a positive interaction between words and pictures or, to put it another way, diminishing returns for words or pictures on their own.  I don’t have any big theory for this, but I think, when expressed as a joint value function, my idea makes sense.  Also, I live this suggestion in my own work.  I typically accompany my graphs with long captions and I try to accompany my words with pictures (although I’m not doing it here, because with the software I use, it’s much easier to type more words than to find, scale, and insert i</p><p>6 0.11534785 <a title="1191-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Continuous_variables_in_Bayesian_networks.html">1228 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Continuous variables in Bayesian networks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>3 0.78809875 <a title="1191-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-16-Another_update_on_the_spam_email_study.html">35 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-16-Another update on the spam email study</a></p>

Akinola Modupe and Katherine Milkman responded to  my email  about  their study :
  
We want to clarify the reason we believe that the use of deception and a lack of informed consent were appropriate and ethical for this research study. In this project, we were studying how the timing of a decision affects discrimination based on race and/or gender.  The emails all participants in our study received were identical except for a) the sender’s name (we used 20 names that pretesting revealed were strongly associated with being either Caucasian, Black, Indian, Chinese or Hispanic, as well as associated with being male or female) and b) whether the meeting requested was for today or for a week from today.  Recipients were randomly selected and were randomly assigned to one of the race/gender/timing conditions.  This study design will allow us to test for baseline levels of discrimination in acade</p><p>4 0.7637645 <a title="1191-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-22-Researching_the_cost-effectiveness_of_political_lobbying_organisations.html">969 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-22-Researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.

<p>Introduction: As someone who relies strongly on survey research, it’s good for me to be reminded that some surveys are useful, some are useless, but one thing they almost all have in common is . . . they waste the respondents’ time.
 
I thought of this after receiving the following email, which I shall reproduce here.  My own comments appear after.

We are emailing you today to debrief you on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study. We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced.

<p>Introduction: Gerrit Storms reports on an interesting linguistic research project in which you can participate!  Here’s the description:
  
Over the past few weeks, we have been trying to set up a scientific study that is important for many researchers interested in words, word meaning, semantics, and cognitive science in general.  It is a huge word association project, in which people are asked to participate in a small task that doesn’t last longer than 5 minutes. Our goal is to build a global word association network that contains connections between about 40,000 words, the size of the lexicon of an average adult. Setting up such a network might learn us a lot about semantic memory, how it develops, and maybe also about how it can deteriorate (like in Alzheimer’s disease). Most people enjoy doing the task, but we need thousands of participants to succeed. Up till today, we found about 53,000 participants willing to do the little task, but we need more subjects. That is why we address you.

<p>Introduction: Ken Rice writes:
  
In the recent discussion on  stopping rules  I saw a comment that I wanted to chip in on, but thought it might get a bit lost, in the already long thread. Apologies in advance if I misinterpreted what you wrote, or am trying to tell you things you already know.


 The comment  was: “In Bayesian decision making, there is a utility function and you choose the decision with highest expected utility. Making a decision based on statistical significance does not correspond to any utility function.”


… which immediately suggests  this  little 2010 paper; A Decision-Theoretic Formulation of Fisher’s Approach to Testing, The American Statistician, 64(4) 345-349. It contains utilities that lead to decisions that very closely mimic classical Wald tests, and provides a rationale for why this utility is not totally unconnected from how some scientists think. Some (old) slides discussing it  are here .


A few notes, on things not in the paper:

<p>Introduction: From  a couple years ago but still relevant, I think:
  
To me, the Lindley paradox falls apart because of its noninformative prior distribution on the parameter of interest. If you really think there’s a high probability the parameter is nearly exactly zero, I don’t see the point of the model saying that you have no prior information at all on the parameter. In short: my criticism of so-called Bayesian hypothesis testing is that it’s insufficiently Bayesian.
  
P.S.  To clarify (in response to Bill’s comment below):  I’m speaking of all the examples I’ve ever worked on in social and environmental science, where in some settings I can imagine a parameter being very close to zero and in other settings I can imagine a parameter taking on just about any value in a wide range, but where I’ve never seen an example where a parameter could be  either  right at zero  or  taking on any possible value.  But such examples might occur in areas of application that I haven’t worked on.</p><p>4 0.91927576 <a title="1191-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-09-My_homework_success.html">896 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-09-My homework success</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A friend writes to me:
  
You will be amused to know that students in our Bayesian Inference paper at 4th year found solutions to exercises from your book on-line.  The amazing thing was that some of them were dumb enough to copy out solutions verbatim.   However, I thought you might like to know you have done well in this class!
  
Iâ&euro;&trade;m happy to hear this.  I worked hard on those solutions!</p><p>5 0.91923702 <a title="1191-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Steve_Jobs%E2%80%99s_cancer_and_science-based_medicine.html">953 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Steve Jobs’s cancer and science-based medicine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  from David Gorski (which I found via  this  link from Joseph Delaney).
 
I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.  It’s only n=1 and adds almost nothing to the literature on the effectiveness of various treatments, but a story like this can help focus one’s thoughts on the decision problems.</p><p>6 0.91871738 <a title="1191-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-18-Understanding_posterior_p-values.html">2029 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-18-Understanding posterior p-values</a></p>

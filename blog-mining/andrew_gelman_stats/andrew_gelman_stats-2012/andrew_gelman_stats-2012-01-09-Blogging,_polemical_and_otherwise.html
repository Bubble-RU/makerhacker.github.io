<p>Introduction: That’s ok , Krugman earlier  slammed  Galbraith.  (I wonder if Krugman is as big a fan of “tough choices” now as he was  in 1996 .)  Given Krugman’s politicization in recent years, I’m surprised he’s so dismissive of the political (rather than technical-economic) nature of Hayek’s influence.  (I don’t know if he’s changed his views on Galbraith in recent years.)
 
P.S.  Greg Mankiw, in contrast,  labels  Galbraith and Hayek as “two of the great economists of the 20th century” and writes, “even though their most famous works were written many decades ago, they are still well worth reading today.”</p><p>3 0.15429081 <a title="1108-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-27-What_is_an_economic_%E2%80%9Cconspiracy_theory%E2%80%9D%3F.html">630 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-27-What is an economic “conspiracy theory”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reviewing a research article by Michael Spence and Sandile Hlatshwayo about globalization (a paper with the  sobering message  that “higher-paying jobs [are] likely to follow low-paying jobs in leaving US,” Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
It is also a useful corrective to the political conspiracy theories of changes in the income distribution. . .
  
Being not-so-blissfully ignorant of macroeconomics, I can focus on the political question, namely these conspiracy theories.
 
I’m not quite sure what Cowen is referring to here–he neglects to provide a link to the conspiracy theories–but I’m guessing he’s referring to the famous graph by  Piketty and Saez  showing how very high-end incomes (top 1% or 0.1%) have, since the 1970s, risen much more dramatically in the U.S. than in other countries, along with claims by Paul Krugman and others that much of this difference can be explained by political changes in the U.S.  In particular, top tax rates in the U.S. have declined since the 1970s and the p</p><p>4 0.15106647 <a title="1108-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>5 0.13944516 <a title="1108-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>6 0.13487159 <a title="1108-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-John_McAfee_is_a_Heinlein_hero.html">1616 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-John McAfee is a Heinlein hero</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  and  this .  There seems to be a perception that “economists, the people who will cooly explain why people will be completely corrupt if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, see themselves as being completely not corrupt” (according to Atrios) and that “the economists who have decided to lend their names to the [Romney] campaign have been caught up in this culture of fraud” (according to Krugman).
 
The bloggers above are talking about macro, and perhaps they’re right that macroeconomists see themselves as uncorruptible and above it all.  As with political science, the key parts of macroeconomics are about what is good for the world (or, at least, what is good for the country), and it’s hard to do this well from a level of complete cynicism.  I’m no expert on macroeconomics, but my general impression is that, Marxists aside, macroeconomists tend to assume shared goals.

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>4 0.75972593 <a title="1108-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>

And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>5 0.74771976 <a title="1108-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics%3A__Why_ask_%E2%80%9CWhat_went_wrong%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1100 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics:  Why ask “What went wrong?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.
 
2.

<p>Introduction: Last year  we discussed  an important challenge in causal inference:  The standard advice (given in many books, including ours) for causal inference is to control for relevant pre-treatment variables as much as possible.  But, as Judea Pearl has pointed out, instruments (as in “instrumental variables”) are pre-treatment variables that we would  not  want to “control for” in a matching or regression sense.
 
At first, this seems like a minor modification, with the new recommendation being to apply instrumental variables estimation using all pre-treatment instruments, and to control for all other pre-treatment variables.  But that can’t really work as general advice.  What about weak instruments or covariates that have some instrumental aspects?
 
I asked Paul Rosenbaum for his thoughts on the matter, and he wrote the following:
  
In section 18.2 of Design of Observational Studies (DOS), I [Rosenbaum] discuss “seemingly innocuous confounding” defined to be a covariate that predicts a su</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94919437 <a title="1108-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-09-Blogging%2C_polemical_and_otherwise.html">1108 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-09-Blogging, polemical and otherwise</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of Paul Krugman and his critics, Noah Smith compares two styles of argumentation:
  
Way #1 is to put your complete thought process on a page – to lay out both sides of an argument, and explain why you arrived at a conclusion. This is what [Tyler] Cowen calls the “Humean” method, after David Hume. As I [Smith] see it, the Humean method is what you use if you want to get the most out of a discussion with a well-informed but fundamentally disinterested interlocutor. . . .


But not all interlocutors are disinterested. Some have political agendas. Some have strong personal biases. And not all interlocutors are well-informed. . . . In this situation, it may provide the most social benefit to adopt a more Hegelian method of argumentation. . . . two people argue their cases as strongly as possible, and observers can pick and choose the best points of each. This is how our court system works, for example. In the context of econ blogs, using a Hegelian approach means saying “</p><p>3 0.94305944 <a title="1108-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-12-That_claim_that_Harvard_admissions_discriminate_in_favor_of_Jews%3F__After_seeing_the_statistics%2C_I_don%E2%80%99t_see_it..html">1720 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-12-That claim that Harvard admissions discriminate in favor of Jews?

<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.  Some people have sent me some information showing serious problems with Unz’s methods</p><p>4 0.92350376 <a title="1108-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-05-Someone_is_wrong_on_the_internet%2C_part_2.html">1563 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-05-Someone is wrong on the internet, part 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My coblogger John Sides  feeds  a troll.  It’s a tough call.  Yesterday I gave my  reasoning  for ignoring these provocateurs, but in this case the troll in question is writing for a major newspaper so it makes sense for John to go to the trouble of shooting him down.  Even though I suspect the columnist was trolling for no better reason than . . . he had a deadline and nothing to say so he thought he’d wade into a controversy.
 
On the plus side, as a statistician I’m happy that statistics is considered important enough that it’s worth trolling!

<p>Introduction: Nurit Baytch posted a document,  A Critique of Ron Unz’s Article “The Myth of American Meritocracy” , that is relevant to an ongoing discussion we had on this blog. Baytch’s article begins:
  
In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show. In addition, Unz’s arguments have proven to be untenable in light of a recent survey of incoming Harvard freshmen conducted by The Harvard Crimson, which found that students who identified as Jewish reported a mean SAT score of 2289</p><p>6 0.91614521 <a title="1108-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Janet_Mertz%E2%80%99s_response_to_%E2%80%9CThe_Myth_of_American_Meritocracy%E2%80%9D.html">1751 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Janet Mertz’s response to “The Myth of American Meritocracy”</a></p>

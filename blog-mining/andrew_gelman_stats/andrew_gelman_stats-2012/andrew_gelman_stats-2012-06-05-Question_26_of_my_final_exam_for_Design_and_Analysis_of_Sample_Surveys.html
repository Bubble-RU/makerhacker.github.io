You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science—and soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It’s taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power—as well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  our discussion  the other day, Matt Buttice and Ben Highton write:
  
It was nice to see our article mentioned and discussed by Andrew, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza on Andrew’s blog in this post on Wednesday.  As noted in the post, we recently published an  article  in Political Analysis on how well multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) performs at producing estimates of state opinion with conventional national surveys where N≈1,500.  Our central claims are that (i) the performance of MRP is highly variable, (ii) in the absence of knowing the true values, it is difficult to determine the quality of the MRP estimates produced on the basis of a single national sample, and, (iii) therefore, our views about the usefulness of MRP in instances where a researcher has a single sample of N≈1,500 are less optimistic than the ones expressed in previous research on the topic.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  our discussion  the other day, Matt Buttice and Ben Highton write:
  
It was nice to see our article mentioned and discussed by Andrew, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza on Andrew’s blog in this post on Wednesday.  As noted in the post, we recently published an  article  in Political Analysis on how well multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) performs at producing estimates of state opinion with conventional national surveys where N≈1,500.  Our central claims are that (i) the performance of MRP is highly variable, (ii) in the absence of knowing the true values, it is difficult to determine the quality of the MRP estimates produced on the basis of a single national sample, and, (iii) therefore, our views about the usefulness of MRP in instances where a researcher has a single sample of N≈1,500 are less optimistic than the ones expressed in previous research on the topic.  


Obviously we were interested in the blog posts.  We found them stimulating</p><p>6 0.74298704 <a title="1367-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-15-Last_word_on_Mister_P_%28for_now%29.html">2062 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-15-Last word on Mister P (for now)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: They didn’t have room for  all four graphs  of the time-series decomposition so they just  displayed  the date-of-year graph:
 
 
 
They rotated so the graph fit better on the page.  The rotation worked for me, but I was a bit bummed that that they put the title and heading of the graph (“The birthrate tends to drop on holidays . . .”) on the left in the Mar-Apr slot, leaving no room to label Leap Day and April Fool’s.  I suggested to the graphics people that they put the label at the very top and just shrink the rest of the graph by 5 or 10% so as to not take up any more total space.  Then there’d be plenty of space to label Leap Day and April Fool’s.  But they didn’t do it, maybe they felt that it wouldn’t look good to have the label right at the top, I dunno.</p><p>3 0.95900202 <a title="1367-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-23-Can%E2%80%99t_Stop_Won%E2%80%99t_Stop_Mister_P_Beatdown.html">2074 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-23-Can’t Stop Won’t Stop Mister P Beatdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Highton and Matt Buttice point us to  this response  addressing some of the issues Jeff Lax  raised  in his most recent MRP post.
 
P.S.  Jeff replies in comments:
  
It sounds like we’ve converged. They acknowledge MRP performance is significantly better on average than reported in their new paper in PA and yet performance variation in terms of correlation to “truth” remains higher than some might have thought.
  
Cool.  I hope this sort of blog exchange can be a model of scientific discussion.  Instead of a paper just sitting there by itself, it can be openly explored.  Ideally, the published paper would include a link to these discussions of Highton, Buttice, Lax, Phillips, and Ghitza, so that readers would automatically get all this information.</p><p>4 0.95896065 <a title="1367-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-09-Default_priors_update%3F.html">846 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-09-Default priors update?</a></p>

I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.

<p>Introduction: 27. Which of the following problems were identified with the Burnham et al. survey of Iraq mortality? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) The survey used cluster sampling, which is inappropriate for estimating individual out- comes such as death.
 
(b) In their report, Burnham et al. did not identify their primary sampling units.
 
(c) The second-stage sampling was not a probability sample.
 
(d) Survey materials supplied by the authors are incomplete and inconsistent with published descriptions of the survey.

<p>Introduction: Statisticians take tours in other people’s data.
 
All methods of statistical inference rest on statistical models. Experiments typically have problems with compliance, measurement error, generalizability to the real world, and representativeness of the sample. Surveys typically have problems of undercoverage, nonresponse, and measurement error.
 
Real surveys are done to learn about the general population. But real surveys are not random samples. For another example, consider educational tests: what are they exactly measuring? Nobody knows. Medical research: even if it’s a randomized experiment, the participants in the study won’t be a random sample from the population for whom you’d recommend treatment. You don’t need random sampling to generalize the results of a medical experiment to the general population but you need some substantive theory to make the assumption that effects in your nonrepresentative sample of people will be similar to effects in the population of interest.

<p>Introduction: Stephen Collins writes:
  
I’m reading your Multilevel modeling book and am trying to apply it to my work.  I’m concerned with how to estimate a random intercept model if there are hundreds/thousands of levels.  In the Gibbs sampling, am I sampling a parameter for each level?  Or, just the hyper-parameters?  In other words, say I had 500 zipcode intercepts modeled as ~ N(m,s).  Would my posterior be two dimensional, sampling for “m” and “s,” or would it have 502 dimensions?
  
My reply:  Indeed you will have hundreds or thousands of parameters—or, in classical terms, hundreds or thousands of predictive quantities.  But that’s ok.  Even if none of those predictions is precise, you’re learning  about the model.

<p>Introduction: Lots of good statistical methods make use of two models.  For example:
 
- Classical statistics:  estimates and standard errors using the likelihood function; tests and p-values using the sampling distribution.  (The sampling distribution is  not  equivalent to the likelihood, as has been much discussed, for example in sequential stopping problems.)
 
- Bayesian data analysis:  inference using the posterior distribution; model checking using the predictive distribution (which, again, depends on the data-generating process in a way that the likelihood does not).
 
- Machine learning:  estimation using the data; evaluation using cross-validation (which requires some rule for partitioning the data, a rule that stands outside of the data themselves).
 
- Bootstrap, jackknife, etc:  estimation using an “estimator” (which, I would argue, is based in some sense on a model for the data), uncertainties using resampling (which, I would argue, is close to the idea of a “sampling distribution” in</p><p>5 0.1849169 <a title="1628-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-14-Progress%21__%28on_the_understanding_of_the_role_of_randomization_in_Bayesian_inference%29.html">1898 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-14-Progress!

<p>Introduction: Leading theoretical statistician Larry Wassserman  in 2008 :  
  
Some of the greatest contributions of statistics to science involve adding additional randomness and leveraging that randomness. Examples are randomized experiments, permutation tests, cross-validation and data-splitting. These are unabashedly frequentist ideas and, while one can strain to fit them into a Bayesian framework, they don’t really have a place in Bayesian inference. The fact that Bayesian methods do not naturally accommodate such a powerful set of statistical ideas seems like a serious deficiency.
  
To which I responded on the second-to-last paragraph of page 8  here .
 
Larry Wasserman in  2013 :
  
Some people say that there is no role for randomization in Bayesian inference. In other words, the randomization mechanism plays no role in Bayes’ theorem. But this is not really true. Without randomization, we can indeed derive a posterior for theta but it is highly sensitive to the prior.

I’m having a methodological problem and I saw the syllabus for your sampling class online and thought I might be able to ask you about it?


We do a lot of complex surveys nationwide; our typical sample design is as follows:


- stratify by rural/urban/capital 
- sub-stratify the rural and urban strata into NE/NW/SE/SW geographic quadrants 
- select voting precincts as PSUs 
- select households as SSUs 
- select individual respondents as TSUs


I’m relatively new here, and past practice has been to sample voting precincts with probability proportional to size.  It’s desirable because it’s not logistically feasible for us to vary the number of interviews per precinct with precinct size, so it makes the selection probabilities for households more even across precinct sizes. However, I have a complex sampling textbook (Lohr 1999), and it explains how complex it is to calculate sel</p><p>3 0.82681495 <a title="1628-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-04-All_the_Assumptions_That_Are_My_Life.html">2359 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-04-All the Assumptions That Are My Life</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In response to the  discussion  of his remarks on assumptions vs. conditions, Jeff Witmer  writes :
  
If [certain conditions hold] , then the t-test p-value gives a remarkably good approximation to “the real thing” — namely the randomization reference p-value. . . .





I [Witmer] make assumptions about conditions that I cannot check, e.g., that the data arose from a random sample. Of course, just as there is no such thing as a normal population, there is no such thing as a random sample.
  
I disagree strongly with both the above paragraphs!  I say this not to pick a fight with Jeff Witmer but to illustrate how, in statistics, even the most basic points that people take for granted, can’t be.
 
Let’s take the claims in order:
 
1.   The purpose of a t test is to approximate the randomization p-value.   Not to me.  In my world, the purpose of t tests and intervals is to summarize uncertainty in estimates and comparisons.

<p>Introduction: Suguru Mizunoya writes:
  
When we estimate the number of people from a national sampling survey (such as labor force survey) using sampling weights, don’t we obtain underestimated number of people, if the country’s population is growing and the sampling frame is based on an old census data?  In countries with increasing populations, the probability of inclusion changes over time, but the weights can’t be adjusted frequently because census takes place only once every five or ten years.


I am currently working for UNICEF for a project on estimating number of out-of-school children in developing countries. The project leader is comfortable to use estimates of number of people from DHS and other surveys.  But, I am concerned that we may need to adjust the estimated number of people by the population projection, otherwise the estimates will be underestimated.


I googled around on this issue, but I could not find a right article or paper on this.

<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: Phil pointed me to  this paper  so I thought I probably better repeat what I  wrote  a couple years ago:
 
1. The effects are certainly not zero. We are not machines, and anything that can affect our expectations (for example, our success in previous tries) should affect our performance.
 
2. The effects I’ve seen are small, on the order of 2 percentage points (for example, the probability of a success in some sports task might be 45% if you’re “hot” and 43% otherwise).
 
3. There’s a huge amount of variation, not just between but also among players. Sometimes if you succeed you will stay relaxed and focused, other times you can succeed and get overconfidence.
 
4. Whatever the latest results on particular sports, I can’t see anyone overturning the basic finding of Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky that players and spectators alike will perceive the hot hand even when it does not exist and dramatically overestimate the magnitude and consistency of any hot-hand phenomenon that does exist.</p><p>4 0.96332568 <a title="1628-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-31-Untunable_Metropolis.html">833 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-31-Untunable Metropolis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Margolis writes:
  
What are we to make of it when a Metropolis-Hastings step just won’t tune? That is, the acceptance rate is zero at expected-jump-size X, and way above 1/2 at X-exp(-16) (i.e.,  machine precision ).


I’ve solved my practical problem by writing that I would have liked to include results from a diffuse prior, but couldn’t. But I’m bothered by the poverty of my intuition. And since everything I’ve read says this is an issue of efficiency, rather than accuracy, I wonder if I could solve it just by running massive and heavily thinned chains.
  
My reply:
 
I can’t see how this could happen in a well-specified problem!  I suspect it’s a bug.  Otherwise try rescaling your variables so that your parameters will have values on the order of magnitude of 1.
 
To which Margolis responded:
  
I hardly wrote any of the code, so I can’t speak to the bug question — it’s binomial kriging from the R package geoRglm.

<p>Introduction: I remember in 4th grade or so, the teacher would give us a list of vocabulary words each week and we’d have to show we learned them by using each in a sentence.  We quickly got bored and decided to do the assignment by writing a single sentence using all ten words.  (Which the teacher hated, of course.)
 
The above headline is in that spirit, combining  blog   posts  rather than vocabulary words.
 
But that only uses two of the entries.  To really do the job, I’d need to throw in bivariate associations, ecological fallacies, high-dimensional feature selection, statistical significance, the suddenly unpopular name Hilary, snotty reviewers, the contagion of obesity, and milk-related spam.
 
Or we could bring in some of the all-time favorites, such as Bayesians, economists, Finland, beautiful parents and their daughters, goofy graphics, red and blue states, essentialism in children’s reasoning, chess running, and zombies.

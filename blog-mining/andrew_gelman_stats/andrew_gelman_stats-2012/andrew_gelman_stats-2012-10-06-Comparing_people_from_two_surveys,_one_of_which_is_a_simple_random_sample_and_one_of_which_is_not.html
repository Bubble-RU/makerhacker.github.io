I think I am having an existential crisis.


I used to work with animals (rats, mice, gerbils etc.) Then I started to work in marketing research where we did have some kind of random sampling procedure. So up until a few years ago, I was sort of okay.


Now I am teaching marketing research, and I feel like there is no real random sampling anymore. I take pains to get students to understand what random means, and then the whole lot of inferential statistics.  Then almost anything they do – the sample is not random. They think I am contradicting myself.  They use convenience samples at every turn – for their school work, and the enormous amount on online surveying that gets done. Do you have any suggestions for me?


Other than say, something like  this .

<p>Introduction: Early this afternoon I made the plan to teach a new course on sampling, maybe next spring, with the primary audience being political science Ph.D. students (although I hope to get students from statistics, sociology, and other departments).  Columbia already has a sampling course in the statistics department (which I taught for several years); this new course will be centered around political science questions.  Maybe the students can start by downloading data from the National Election Studies and General Social Survey and running some regressions, then we can back up and discuss what is needed to go further.
 
About an hour after discussing this new course with my colleagues, I (coincidentally) received the following email from Mike Alvarez:

A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?

I was quite happy that recently you shared some thoughts of yours and others on meta-analysis. I especially liked the  slides by Chris Schmid  that you linked from your blog. A large portion of my work deals with meta-analysis and I am also fond of using Bayesian methods (actually two of the projects I am working on are very Bayesian), though I can not say I have opinions with respect to the underlying philosophy. I would say though, that I do share your view that there are good reasons to use informative priors.


The reason I am writing to you is that this leads to the following dilemma, which is puzzling me. Say a number of scientists conduct similar studies over the years and all of them did this in a Bayesian fashion. If each of the groups used informative priors based on the research of existing groups the priors could become more and more informative over the years, since more and more is known over the subject.

I am scientist needing to model a treatment effect on a population of ~500 people.  The dependent variable in the model is the difference in a person’s pre-treatment 12 month total medical cost versus post-treatment cost.  So there is large variation in costs, but not so much by using the difference between the pre and post treatment costs.  The issue I’d like some advice on is that the treatment has already occurred so there is no possibility of creating a fully randomized control now.  I do have a very large population of people to use as possible controls via propensity scoring or exact matching.  


If I had a few thousand people to possibly match, then I would use standard techniques.  However, I have a potential population of over a hundred thousand people.  An exact match of the possible controls to age, gender and region of the country still leaves a population of 10,000 controls.

<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):

<p>Introduction: Steve Porter writes with a question about matching for inferences in a hierarchical data structure.  I’ve never thought about this particular issue, but it seems potentially important.
 
Maybe one or more of you have some useful suggestions?
 
Porter writes:
  
 
After immersing myself in the relatively sparse literature on propensity scores with clustered data, it seems as if people take one of two approaches. If the treatment is at the cluster-level (like school policies), they match on only the cluster-level covariates. If the treatment is at the individual level, they match on individual-level covariates. (I have also found some papers that match on individual-level covariates when it seems as if the treatment is really at the cluster-level.) But what if there is a selection process at both levels?


For my research question (effect of tenure systems on faculty behavior) there is a two-step selection process: first colleges choose whether to have a tenure system for faculty; then f</p><p>5 0.75712454 <a title="1523-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-22-Struggles_over_the_criticism_of_the_%E2%80%9Ccannabis_users_and_IQ_change%E2%80%9D_paper.html">1910 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-22-Struggles over the criticism of the “cannabis users and IQ change” paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>6 0.7416271 <a title="1523-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-16-Another_update_on_the_spam_email_study.html">35 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-16-Another update on the spam email study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi Andrew,


I came across your site while searching for blogs and posts around American obesity and wanted to reach out to get your readership’s feedback on an infographic my team built which focuses on the obesity of America and where we could end up at the going rate.


If you’re interested, let’s connect. Have a great weekend!


Thanks.

I’m helping a professor out with an analysis, and I was hoping that you might be able to point me to some relevant literature…  She has two studies that have been completed already (so we can’t go back to the planning stage in terms of sampling, unfortunately).  Both studies are based around the population of adults in LA who attended LA public high schools at some point, so that is the same for both studies.  Study #1 uses random digit dialing, so I consider that one to be SRS.  Study #2, however, is a convenience sample in which all participants were involved with one of eight community-based organizations (CBOs).


Of course, both studies can be analyzed independently, but she was hoping for there to be some way to combine/compare the two studies.  Specifically, I am working on looking at the civic engagement of the adults in both studies.  In study #1, this means looking at factors such as involvement in student government.

<p>Introduction: Statisticians are literalists.
 
When someone says that the U.K. boundary commission’s delay in redistricting gave the Tories an advantage equivalent to 10 percent of the vote, we’re the kind of person who  looks it up  and claims that the effect is less than 0.7 percent.
 
When someone says, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican presidents in times of perceived danger and Democrats in times of relative calm,” we’re like, Hey, really?  And we go look  that one  up too.
 
And when someone says that engineers have more sons and nurses have more daughters . . . well, let’s not go there.
 
So, when I was pointed to  this blog  by Michael O’Hare making the following claim, in the context of K-12 education in the United States:
  
My [O'Hare's] favorite examples of this junk [educational content with no workplace value] are spelling and pencil-and-paper algorithm arithmetic.

<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>5 0.93942857 <a title="1523-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-25-Incoherence_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">1510 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-25-Incoherence of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hogg writes:
  
At the end  this article  you wonder about consistency.  Have you ever considered the possibility that utility might resolve some of the problems?  I have no idea if it 
would—I am not advocating that position—I just get some kind of intuition from phrases like “Judgment is required to decide…”. Perhaps there is a coherent and objective description of what is—or could be—done under a coherent “utility” model (like a utility that could be objectively agreed upon and computed).  Utilities are usually subjective—true—but priors are usually subjective too.
  
My reply:
 
I’m happy to think about utility, for some particular problem or class of problems going to the effort of assigning costs and benefits to different outcomes.  I agree that a utility analysis, even if (necessarily) imperfect, can usefully focus discussion.  For example, if a statistical method for selecting variables is justified on the basis of cost, I like the idea of attempting to quantify the costs of ga</p><p>6 0.93354565 <a title="1523-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding_the_p-value.html">1760 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding the p-value</a></p>

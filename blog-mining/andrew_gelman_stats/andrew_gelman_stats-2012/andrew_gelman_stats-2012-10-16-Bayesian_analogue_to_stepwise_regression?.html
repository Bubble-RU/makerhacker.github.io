Just read  this  today and my unsophisticated statistical mind is confused.


“Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics.”


From my education about statistics, I remember to be suspicious about multiple regression coefficients that are in the opposite direction of the bivariate coefficients. What I am missing? I vaguely remember something about the suppression effect.
  
My reply:
 
There’s a long literature on this from many decades ago.  My general feeling about such situations is that, when the coefficient changes a lot after controlling for other variables, it is important to visualize this change, to understand what is the interaction among variables that is associated with the change in the coefficients.

Regarding the book Mostly Harmless Econometrics, you  state :

 
A casual reader of the book might be left with the unfortunate impression that matching is a competitor to regression rather than a tool for making regression more effective.
 

But in fact isn’t that what they are arguing, that, in a  ‘mostly harmless way’ regression is in fact a matching estimator itself?


“Our view is that regression can be motivated as a particular sort of weighted matching estimator, and therefore the differences between regression and matching estimates are unlikely to be of major empirical importance” (Chapter 3 p. 70)


They seem to be distinguishing regression (without prior matching) from all other types of matching techniques, and therefore implying that regression can be a ‘mostly harmless’ substitute or competitor to matching. My previous understanding, before starting this book was as you say, that matching is a tool that makes regression more effective.

<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this?

I wonder what was in the syllabus?  If anyone has a copy, feel free to send to me and I will post it here.
 
My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.
  
Talk about obedience to authority!  They’re studying in a program that offers nonexistent courses, but then they follow the department’s gag order.</p><p>3 0.87107408 <a title="1535-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-Note_to_the_quals.html">124 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-Note to the quals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>5 0.83922911 <a title="1535-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-07-A_compelling_reason_to_go_to_London%2C_Ontario%3F%3F.html">1104 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-07-A compelling reason to go to London, Ontario??</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein asks what I think of  this :
 
   
 
My reply:
 
It’s hard for me to imagine a compelling reason for anyone to go to London, Ontario–but, hey, I guess there’s all kinds of people in this world! More seriously, I see the appeal of the graph but it’s a bit busy for my taste.  Over the years I’ve moved toward small multiples rather than single busy graphs.  That’s one reason why I prefer Tufte’s second book to his first book.  The Napoleon-in-Russia graph is a bad model, in that inspires people to try to cram lots of variables on a single graph.

I [Dan] like it as a travel planning graph, it gives you what you want to know (how how will the days be, how cold will the nights be, will it rain) but is a bit easier on the brain than a table of highs and lows. Also makes it easy to see the trend.

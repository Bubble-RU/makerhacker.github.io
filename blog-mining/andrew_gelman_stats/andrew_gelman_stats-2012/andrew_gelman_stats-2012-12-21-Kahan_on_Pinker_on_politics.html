<p>Introduction: Psychology is a universal science of human nature, whereas political science is centered on the study of particular historical events and trends.  Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that when a psychologist looks at politics, he presents ideas that are thought-provoking but are too general to quite work.  This is fine; political scientists can then take such ideas and try to adapt them more closely to particular circumstances.
 
The psychologist I’m thinking about here is Steven Pinker, who, in  writes  the following on the question, “Why Are States So Red and Blue?”:
  
But why do ideology and geography cluster so predictably? Why, if you know a person’s position on gay marriage, can you predict that he or she will want to increase the military budget and decrease the tax rate . . . there may also be coherent mindsets beneath the diverse opinions that hang together in right-wing and left-wing belief systems.

<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>4 0.22341149 <a title="1633-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-22-More_Pinker_Pinker_Pinker.html">1635 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-22-More Pinker Pinker Pinker</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I posted  this  recent comment on a blog of Steven Pinker (see also  here ), we had the following exchange.  I’m reposting it here (with Pinker’s agreement) not because we achieved any deep insights but because I thought it useful to reveal to people that so-called experts such as us are not so clear on these issues either. 
   
 AG:   I noticed your article on red and blue states and had some thoughts. . . . The short summary is that I think that your idea is interesting but that, as stated, it explains too much, in that your story is based on centuries-long history but it only fits electoral patterns since the 1980s.
 
 SP:   Though the exact alignment between red and blue states, political parties, and particular issues surely shift, I’d be surprised if the basic alignments between geography and the right-left divide, and the issues that cluster on each side of the divide, have radically changed over the past century. (Obviously if you define “red” and “blue” by the Republican</p><p>5 0.1939452 <a title="1633-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_think_we_get_much_out_of_framing_politics_as_the_Tragic_Vision_vs._the_Utopian_Vision.html">1892 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-10-I don’t think we get much out of framing politics as the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg writes:
  
Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>6 0.17463438 <a title="1633-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-04-Discussion_with_Dan_Kahan_on_political_polarization%2C_partisan_information_processing.__And%2C_more_generally%2C_the_role_of_theory_in_empirical_social_science.html">2050 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-04-Discussion with Dan Kahan on political polarization, partisan information processing.

<p>Introduction: Delia Baldassarri and Amir Goldberg  write :
  
Americans’ political beliefs present a long observed paradox. Whereas the mainstream political discourse is structured on a clearly defined polarity between conservative and liberal views, in practice, most people exhibit ideologically incoherent belief patterns. This paper challenges the notion that political beliefs are necessarily defined by a singular ideological continuum. It applies a new, network-based method for detecting heterogeneity in collective patterns of opinion, relational class analysis (RCA), to Americans’ political attitudes as captured by the American National Election Studies. By refraining from making a-priori assumptions about how beliefs are interconnected, RCA looks for opinion structures, belief networks, that are not necessarily congruent with received wisdom. It finds that in the twenty years between 1984 and 2004 Americans’ political attitudes were consistently structured by two alternative belief systems: one</p><p>4 0.79718328 <a title="1633-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">1166 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Recently in the sister blog</a></p>

My graphs– what do you think??

 

I guess what do you think of the result too, but the answer is, “That’s obvious!”  If it hadn’t been, then it would have been suspicious in my book. Of course, if we had found the opposite result, that would have been “obvious!” too.  We are submitting to   LR ≠1 Journa l 

 This is the latest study in series looking at relationship between critical reasoning capacities and “cultural cognition” — the tendency of individuals to conform their perceptions of risk & other policy-relevant facts to their group commitments. The first installment was an  observational study  that found that cultural polarization ( political too ; the distinction relate not to the mechanism for polarization over decision-relevant science but only about  how to measure  what is hypothesized to be driving it) increases as people become more science literate.

I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


The Workshop for Women in Machine Learning is a day-long event taking place on the first day of NIPS. 
The workshop aims to showcase the research of women in machine learning and to strengthen their community. 
The event brings together female faculty, graduate students, and research scientists for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in pursuing machine learning research are encouraged to participate. While all presenters will be female, all genders are invited to attend.


Scholarships will be provided to female students and postdoctoral attendees with accepted abstracts to partially offset travel costs.

<p>Introduction: Reacting to my recent  post  on Steven Pinker’s too-broad (in my opinion) speculations on red and blue states, Dan “cultural cognition” Kahan  writes :
  
 Pinker is clearly right to note that mass political opinions on seemingly diverse issues cohere, and Andrew, I think, is way too quick to challenge this 


I [Kahan] could cite to billions of interesting papers, but I’ll just show you what I mean instead. A recent CCP data collection involving a nationally representative on-line sample of 1750 subjects included a module that asked the subjects to indicate on a six-point scale “how strongly . . . you support or oppose” a collection of policies:  


policy_gun  Stricter gun control laws in the United States. 
policy_healthcare  Universal health care. 
policy_taxcut  Raising income taxes for persons in the highest-income tax bracket. 
policy_affirmative action  Affirmative action for minorities. 
policy_warming  Stricter carbon emission standards to reduce global warming.

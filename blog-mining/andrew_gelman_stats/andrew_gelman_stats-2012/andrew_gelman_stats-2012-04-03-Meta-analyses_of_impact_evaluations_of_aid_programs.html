<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.
  
They write:

<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
Did you know that it looks like Microsoft is entering the modeling game? I mean, outside of Excel. I recently received an email at work from a MS research contractor looking for ppl that program in R, SAS, Matlab, Excel, and Mathematica. . . . So far I [the person who sent me this email] haven’t seen anything about applying any actual models. Only stuff about assigning variables, deleting rows, merging tables, etc. I don’t know how common knowledge this all is within the statistical community. I did a quick google search for the name of the programming language and didn’t come up with anything.
  
That sounds cool.  Working with anything from Microsoft sounds pretty horrible, but it would be useful to have another modeling language out there, just for checking our answers if nothing else.</p><p>5 0.062620036 <a title="1244-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-03-Kuhn%2C_1-f_noise%2C_and_the_fractal_nature_of_scientific_revolutions.html">1924 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-03-Kuhn, 1-f noise, and the fractal nature of scientific revolutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
I was re-reading your and Shalizi’s  “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics”  [see also the  rejoinder ] and noticed a statement near the end of section 6 about paradigm shifts coming in different magnitudes over different time spans.  That reminded me of the almost-mystical ideas surrounding 1/f (f being frequency”) noise in some areas — the notion that almost everything exhibits that effect, and that effect extends to arbitrarily low f.  (I sense the idea only gets mystical when f gets low enough so that the event that may happen stochastically is really big—say, you model the height of waves in the Atlantic as 1/f and discover that, at some low frequency, Bermuda becomes submerged.  In other words, does the same mechanism that accounts for physical vibrations in the range of Hertz also account for the creation and destruction of islands that may occur in the range of reciprocal centuries?)

<p>Introduction: Alex Braunstein  writes  about Klout, a company which measures Twitter/Facebook influence:
  
As a Ph D statistician and search quality engineer, I [Braunstein] know a lot about how to properly measure things. In the past few months I’ve become an active Twitter user and very interested in measuring the influence of individuals. Klout provides a way to measure influence on Twitter using a score also called Klout. The range is 0 to 100. Light users score below 20, regular users around 30, and celebrities start around 75. Naturally, I was intrigued by the Klout measurement, but a careful analysis led to some serious issues with the score. . . .
  
Braunstein continues with some comparisons of different twitter-users and how their Klout scores don’t make much sense.  I don’t really see the point of the Klout scores in the first place:  I guess they’re supposed to be a quick measure to use in pricing advertising?  Whatever, I don’t really care.
 
What did interest me was a remark on Brauns</p><p>4 0.57782483 <a title="1244-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi_Google_search_est_devenu_plus_raisonnable%3F.html">207 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi Google search est devenu plus raisonnable?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received an email from the Royal Statistical Society asking if I wanted to submit a 400-word discussion to the article,  Vignettes and health systems responsiveness in cross-country comparative analyses  by Nigel Rice, Silvana Robone and Peter C. Smith.
 
My first thought was No, I can’t do it, I don’t know anything about health systems responsiveness etc.  But then I thought, sure, I always have  something  to say.  So I skimmed the article and was indeed motivated to write something.  Here’s what I sent in:
  
As a frequent user of survey data, I am happy to see this work on improving the reliability and validity of subjective responses.  My only comment is to recommend that the statistical sophistication that is evident in the in the design and modeling in this study be applied to the summaries as well.  I have three suggestions in particular.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.
 
I’m guessing that the taxi driver quoted above is subject to the same illusions</p><p>2 0.94133329 <a title="1244-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-30-Memorial_Day_question.html">737 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-30-Memorial Day question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>3 0.84035122 <a title="1244-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-02-At_least_he_didn%E2%80%99t_prove_a_false_theorem.html">741 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-02-At least he didn’t prove a false theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Siobhan Mattison pointed me to  this .  I’m just disappointed they didn’t use my  Fenimore Cooper  line.  Although I guess that reference wouldn’t resonate much outside the U.S.
 
P.S.  My guess was correct   See comments below.  Actually, the reference probably wouldn’t resonate so well among under-50-year-olds in the U.S. either.

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

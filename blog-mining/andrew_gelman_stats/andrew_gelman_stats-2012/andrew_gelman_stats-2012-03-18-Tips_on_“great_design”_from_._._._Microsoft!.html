<p>Introduction: This one is fun because I have a double conflict of interest:  I’ve been paid (at different times) both by Google and by Microsoft.
 
Here’s the story:
 
Microsoft,  September 2012 :
  
An independent research company, Answers Research based in San Diego, CA, conducted a study using a representative online sample of nearly 1000 people, ages 18 and older from across the US. The participants were chosen from a random survey panel and were required to have used a major search engine in the past month. Participants were not aware that Microsoft was involved.  


In the test, participants were shown the main web search results pane of both Bing and Google for 10 search queries of their choice. Bing and Google search results were shown side-by-side on one page for easy comparison – with all branding removed from both search engines. The test did not include ads or content in other parts of the page such as Bing’s Snapshot and Social Search panes and Google’s Knowledge Graph. For each search,</p><p>3 0.14854509 <a title="1219-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-In_today%E2%80%99s_economy%2C_the_rich_get_richer.html">367 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-In today’s economy, the rich get richer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Edward Wyatt  reports :
  
Now the Obama administration is cracking down on what many call  patent trolls , shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid . . . “The United States patent system is vital for our economic growth, job creation, and technological advance,” [Senator] Leahy said in a statement. “Unfortunately, misuse of low-quality patents through patent trolling has tarnished the system’s image.”
  
There is some opposition:
  
But some big software companies, including Microsoft, expressed dismay at some of the proposals, saying they could themselves stifle innovation.
  
Microsoft . . . patent trolls . . . hmmm, where have we heard this connection  before ?
 
There is also some support for the bill:
  
“These guys are terrorists,” said John Boswell, chief legal officer for SAS, a business software and services company, said at a panel discussion on Tuesday. SAS was cited in the White House report as an example of a company that has</p><p>5 0.13023563 <a title="1219-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-20-Andy_vs._the_Ideal_Point_Model_of_Voting.html">355 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-20-Andy vs. the Ideal Point Model of Voting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression   
book (p. 317), using the U.S. Senate instead of the Supreme Court, and

<p>Introduction: Regarding  editing :  The only serious editing I’ve ever received has been for my New York Times op-eds and my article in the American Scientist.  My book editors have all been nice people, and they’ve helped me with many things (including suggestions of what my priorities should be in communicating with readers)–they’ve been great–but they’ve not given (nor have I expected or asked for) serious editing.  Maybe I should’ve asked for it, I don’t know.  I’ve had time-wasting experiences with copy editors and a particularly annoying experience with a production editor (who was so difficult that my coauthors and I actually contacted our agent and a lawyer about the possibility of getting out of our contract), but that’s another story.
 
Regarding  clutch hitting , Bill James once noted that it’s great when a Bucky Dent hits an unexpected home run, but what’s really special is being able to get the big hit when it’s expected of you.  The best players can do their best every time they come t</p><p>3 0.72735459 <a title="1219-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-17-%E2%80%9CFaith_means_belief_in_something_concerning_which_doubt_is_theoretically_possible.%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%94_William_James.html">1419 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-17-“Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.” — William James</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone writes:
  
Probably not blog-worthy/blog-appropriate, but have you heard Bill James  discussing  the Sandusky & Paterno stuff?  I think you discussed once his stance on the Dowd Report, and this seems to be from the same part of his personality—which goes beyond contrarian . . .
  
I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.
 
In this sense even more of the blame should go</p><p>4 0.7250964 <a title="1219-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-09-Chartjunk%2C_but_in_a_good_cause%21.html">509 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-09-Chartjunk, but in a good cause!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  Dan Goldstein :
 
 
 
Pretty good, but really the pie chart should be three-dimensional, shown at an angle, and with one or two of the slices popping out.
 
P.S.  They seemed to have placed a link for the Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.  That bookâ&euro;&trade;s ok, but what I was really recommending were his Abstracts from 1982-1986, which are something else entirely.</p><p>5 0.69166648 <a title="1219-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-11-Toshiro_Kageyama_on_professionalism.html">1113 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-11-Toshiro Kageyama on professionalism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on our  discussion  of professionalism (in which Jonathan Chait argued that “the definition of a professional career track” requires pay differentials and the chance to get fired, and I argued the opposite, that a lot of people go into professional careers specifically because of the job security), Austin Frakt pointed me to  this description  of professionalism from Go master Toshiro Kageyama.
 
This in turn reminds me of a remark of Bill James when he explained lack of surprise that clutch hitting does not show up in the data.  He wrote that the underlying idea of clutch hitting is that a player will play particuarly well in an important situation where the game or the season is on the line.  But, James pointed out, these guys are pros, and the true sign of a professional is that he can always stay concentrated.
 
This argument applies particuarly for hitting, maybe less so for pitching, where a pitcher can’t necessarily throw his hardest for 100 pitches in a game.</p><p>6 0.67109251 <a title="1219-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-02-Bill_James_and_the_base-rate_fallacy.html">642 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-02-Bill James and the base-rate fallacy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I came across  this  (link from  here ):
  
A post . . . reminded me of a great technique I [@destraynor] learned about from Bill Buxton. Bill is a Principal Researcher in Microsoft where his main role focuses on designing a company that permits great design to happen. As many have learned to their peril, it’s not simply a case of just dumping talent in a room full of Ikea furniture. In large companies you have to design the process that creates design. One key idea Bill advocates is an emphasis on exploring the solution space before iterating on a solution. . . .
  
It goes on from there, but all I could think of was . . . this must be the first time the words “Microsoft” and “a company that permits great design to happen” have ever appeared in the same sentence.  Sure, Clippy was great and Windows Vista has changed how we think about the world, but what great things has Microsoft done lately?

<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .

<p>Introduction: One example we give to illustrate  Benford’s law  is the first digits of addresses.  Javier Marquez Pena had a survey and, just for laffs, he looked the distribution of first digits:
 
 
 
Cool—it really works!
 
P.S.  The y-axis shouldn’t go below zero, and I’d much prefer an L-type graphics box (par(bty=”l”)) rather than the square, but those are familiar problems with R defaults.</p><p>4 0.83172858 <a title="1219-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-01-Huff_the_Magic_Dragon.html">1293 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-01-Huff the Magic Dragon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Upon reading  this , Susan remarked, “Don’t you think it’s interesting that a guy who promotes smoking has a last name of ‘Huff’?  Reminds me of the Dennis/Dentist studies.”
 
Good point.
 
P.S.  As discussed in the linked thread, the great statistician R. A. Fisher was notorious for minimizing the risks of smoking.  How does this connect to Fisher’s name, one might ask?</p><p>5 0.83128327 <a title="1219-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis_testing_with_multiple_imputations.html">799 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis testing with multiple imputations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vincent Yip writes:
  
I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution? Do I combine the 5 imputed data set into one by averaging each imputed values so I get one single imputed data and compare with the ob</p><p>6 0.82722867 <a title="1219-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Why_display_6_years_instead_of_30%3F.html">1258 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Why display 6 years instead of 30?</a></p>

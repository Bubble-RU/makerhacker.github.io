</p><p>5 To put it in graphical terms:            In blue America (where Charles Murray, David Brooks, David Frum, and I live), rich people are a bit more economically conservative then poor people but this is balanced by rich people being more socially liberal. [sent-12, score-1.576]

<p>Introduction: The other day I posted  some comments  on the voting patterns of rich and poor in the context of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart.”  My graphs on income and voting are just fine, but I mischaracterized Murray’s statements.  So I want to fix that right away.  After that I have some thoughts on the book itself.
 
In brief:
 
1. I was unfair to call him a Tucker Carlson.
 
2. Murray talks a lot about upper-class liberals. That’s fine but I think his discussion would be improved by also considering upper-class conservatives, given that I see the big culture war occurring within the upper class.
 
3. Using the case of Joe Paterno as an example, I discuss why Murray’s “preach what you practice” advice could be difficult to carry out in practice. 
   
 Murray on the top 5%

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>4 0.27748924 <a title="1159-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Are_all_rich_people_now_liberals%3F.html">201 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Are all rich people now liberals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So  asks  James Ledbetter in Slate.
 
And  the answer is  . . . No!

P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.
 
I think that Ferguson (and Callahan) a</p><p>5 0.27710858 <a title="1159-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-14-Richer_people_continue_to_vote_Republican.html">1577 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-14-Richer people continue to vote Republican</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the exit polls:
 
 
 
This is all pretty obvious but it seemed worth posting because some people still don’t seem to get it.  For example, Jay Cost,  writing  in the Weekly Standard:
  
The Democratic party now dominates the Upper East Side of Manhattan, as well as the wealthiest neighborhoods in the most powerful cities. And yet Republicans are still effectively castigated as the party of the rich. They are not — at least not any more than the Democratic party is.
  
Arguably,  both  the Democrats and the Republicans are “the party of the rich.”  But Republicans more so than Democrats (see above graph, also consider the debates over the estate tax and upper-income tax rates).  Cost writes:
  
Sure, the GOP favors tax rate reductions to generate economic growth, but the Democratic party has proven itself ready, willing, and able to dole out benefits to the well-heeled rent-seekers who swarm Washington, D.C. looking for favors from Uncle Sam.
  
But he’s missing the point.  The par</p><p>6 0.26968116 <a title="1159-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-02-Culture_clash.html">1836 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-02-Culture clash</a></p>

Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>4 0.80870998 <a title="1159-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-27-Why_aren%E2%80%99t_Asians_Republicans%3F__For_one_thing%2C_more_than_half_of_them_live_in_California%2C_New_York%2C_New_Jersey%2C_and_Hawaii.html">1593 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-27-Why aren’t Asians Republicans?

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

<p>Introduction: Charles Murray wrote a much-discussed new book, “Coming Apart:  The State of White America, 1960-2010.”
 
David Frum  quotes  Murray as writing, in an echo of now-forgotten TV personality  Tucker Carlson , that the top 5% of incomes “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it.  Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”
 
[I’ve interjected a “perhaps” into the title of this blog post to indicate that I don’t have the exact Murray quote here so I’m relying on David Frum’s interpretation.]
 
Frum does me the favor of citing Red State Blue State as evidence, and I’d like to back this up with some graphs.
 
Frum writes:
  
Say “top 5%” to Murray, and his imagination conjures up everything he dislikes: coastal liberals listening to NPR in their Lexus hybrid SUVs. He sees that image so intensely that no mere number can force him to remember that the top 5% also includes the evangelical Christian assistant coach of a state university football team. . . .

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>3 0.94046801 <a title="1159-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-20-Could_someone_please_lock_this_guy_and_Niall_Ferguson_in_a_room_together%3F.html">1504 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-20-Could someone please lock this guy and Niall Ferguson in a room together?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeffrey Frankel, identified as a former member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers,  writes  (link from  here ):
  
As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. . . .


The unspoken truth is that, compared to “blue-staters,” those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies.
  
An unspoken truth, huh?  Wow, that really sucks!  Something should be done about it.  Good thing that this Harvard professor and former member of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors is on the case:

<p>Introduction: The other day I posted  some comments  on the voting patterns of rich and poor in the context of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart.”  My graphs on income and voting are just fine, but I mischaracterized Murray’s statements.  So I want to fix that right away.  After that I have some thoughts on the book itself.
 
In brief:
 
1. I was unfair to call him a Tucker Carlson.
 
2. Murray talks a lot about upper-class liberals. That’s fine but I think his discussion would be improved by also considering upper-class conservatives, given that I see the big culture war occurring within the upper class.
 
3. Using the case of Joe Paterno as an example, I discuss why Murray’s “preach what you practice” advice could be difficult to carry out in practice.

<p>Introduction: Xian posts his  memories  of Julian Besag, who is perhaps most famous for publishing the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (see  here  for some background).  I met Besag in 1989 when I spoke at the University of Washington; also I have a memory of a conference in 1992 or 1993, I think it was, when he objected strongly to my use of the chi-squared test to check the fit of a Bayesian model.  (In retrospect, I don’t think I presented my ideas clearly enough; some of the material in that talk ended up in  this article  with Meng and Stern.)  I also recall a talk I gave in Seattle around 1996, when Besag commented that the models I was using for spatial analysis were pretty crude–a fair comment, actually.  I don’t actually recall any of Besag’s lectures, but I read many of his papers.  As Xian said, Besag did innovative and important work on spatial statistics, work that will be long used and remembered.  He was in many ways ahead of his time and was a rarity in his generation of Bayesian statist</p><p>6 0.93297219 <a title="1159-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-02-Where_do_our_taxes_go%3F.html">311 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-02-Where do our taxes go?</a></p>

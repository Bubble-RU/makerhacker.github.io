<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.  I can’t believe anyone has such a precise estimate of the health effects of pesticides, and also I can’t believe anyone has such a precise effect of the health effect of eating an app</p><p>3 0.12816924 <a title="1187-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-27-Macromuddle.html">1347 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-27-Macromuddle</a></p>
<p>Introduction: More and more I feel like economics reporting is based on crude principles of adding up “good news” and “bad news.”  Sometimes this makes sense:  by almost any measure, an unemployment rate of 10% is bad news compared to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Other times, though, the good/bad news framework seems so tangled.
 
For example:  house prices up is considered good news but inflation is considered bad news.  A strong dollar is considered good news but it’s also an unfavorable exchange rate, which is bad news.  When facebook shares go down, that’s bad news, but if they automatically go up, that means they were underpriced which doesn’t seem so good either.  Pundits are torn between rooting for the euro to fail (which means our team (the U.S.) is better than Europe (their team)) and rooting for it to survive (because a collapse in Europe is bad news for the U.S. economy).  China’s economy doing well is bad news—but if their economy slips, that’s bad news too.  I think you get the picture</p><p>4 0.11715445 <a title="1187-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful_Line_Charts.html">1125 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful Line Charts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I stumbled across a chart that’s in my opinion the best way to express a comparison of quantities through time:
 
   
 
It  compares  the new PC companies, such as Apple, to traditional PC companies like IBM and Compaq, but on the same scale. If you’d like to see how iPads and other novelties compare, see  here . I’ve tried to use the same type of visualization in my old work on  legal data visualization .
 
  
 
It comes from a new market research firm Asymco that also produced a very clean  income vs expenses  visualization (click to enlarge):
 
   
 
While the first figure is pure perfection, Tufte purists might find the second one too colorful. But to a busy person, color helps tell things apart: when I know that pink means interest, it takes a fraction of the second to assess the situation. We live in 2012, not in 1712 to have to think black and white.
 
Finally, they have a few other interesting uses of interactive visualization, such as  cellular-broadband infrastructure  around</p><p>5 0.097809732 <a title="1187-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-11-Rajiv_Sethi_on_the_interpretation_of_prediction_market_data.html">607 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-11-Rajiv Sethi on the interpretation of prediction market data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi has some  very interesting things to say :
  
As the election season draws closer, considerable attention will be paid to prices in prediction markets such as Intrade. Contracts for potential presidential nominees are already being scrutinized for early signs of candidate strength. . . .


This interpretation of prices as probabilities is common and will be repeated frequently over the coming months. But what could the “perceived likelihood according to the market” possibly mean?


Prediction market prices contain valuable information about this distribution of beliefs, but  there is no basis for the common presumption that the price at last trade represents the beliefs of a hypothetical average trader  in any meaningful sense [emphasis added]. In fact, to make full use of market data to make inferences about the distribution of beliefs, one needs to look beyond the price at last trade and examine the entire order book.

<p>Introduction: A  New York Times article  reports the opening of a half-mile section of bike path, recently built along the west side of Manhattan at a cost of $16M, or roughly $30 million per mile.  That’s about $5700 per linear foot.  Kinda sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?   
 
Well, $30 million per mile for about one car-lane mile is a lot, but it’s not out of line compared to other urban highway construction costs.  The Doyle Drive project in San Francisco — a freeway to replace the current old and deteriorating freeway approach to the Golden Gate Bridge — is currently under way at $1 billion for 1.6 miles…but hey, it will have six lanes each way, so that isn’t so bad, at $50 million per lane-mile.  And there are other components to the project, too, not just building the highway (there will also be bike paths, landscaping, on- and off-ramps, and so on).  All in all it seems roughly in line with the New York bike lane project.
 
Speaking of the Doyle Drive project, one expense was the cost of movin</p><p>3 0.80531269 <a title="1187-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-14-Higgs_bozos%3A__Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_are_spinning_in_their_graves.html">1058 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-14-Higgs bozos:  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are spinning in their graves</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg sends in this  bizarre bit  of news reporting by Robert Evans:
  
Until now, in the four decades since it was first posited, no one has convincingly claimed to have glimpsed the Higgs Boson, let alone proved that it actually exists.


At an eagerly awaited briefing on Tuesday at the CERN research centre near Geneva, two independent teams of “Higgs Hunters” – a term they themselves hate – were widely expected to suggest they were fairly confident they had spotted it.


But not confident enough, in the physics world of ultra-precision where certainty has to be measured at nothing less than 100 percent, to announce “a discovery.”


In the jargon, this level is described as 5 sigma . . .
  
So far, so good.  But then comes this doozy:
  
As one scientist explained, that level of accuracy would equate to the 17th-century discoverer of gravity, Isaac Newton, sitting under his apple tree and a million apples one after another falling on his head without one missing.

<p>Introduction: Reed Abelson and Gardiner Harris  report  in the New York Times that some serious statistical questions have been raised about the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, an influential project that reports huge differences in health care costs and practices in different places in the United States, suggesting large potential cost savings if more efficient practices are used.  (A claim that is certainly plausible to me, given  this notorious graph ; see  here  for background.)
 
Here’s an example of a claim from the  Dartmouth Atlas  (just picking something that happens to be featured on their webpage right now):
  
Medicare beneficiaries who move to some regions receive many more diagnostic tests and new diagnoses than those who move to other regions. This study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, raises important questions about whether being given more diagnoses is beneficial to patients and may help to explain recent controversies about regional differences in spending.

<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>6 0.7910164 <a title="1187-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-02-Roads%2C_traffic%2C_and_the_importance_in_decision_analysis_of_carefully_examining_your_goals.html">988 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-02-Roads, traffic, and the importance in decision analysis of carefully examining your goals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Now that you have some free time again, you’ll have to check out  these books  and tell us if they’re worth reading.
 
Claire Kirch  reports :
  
Lizzie Skurnick Books launches in September with the release of Debutante Hill by Lois Duncan. The novel, which was originally published by Dodd, Mead, in 1958, has been out of print for about three decades.


The other books on the initial list, all reissues, are A Long Day in November by Ernest J. Gaines (originally published in 1971), Happy Endings Are All Alike by Sandra Scoppettone (1979), I’ll Love You When You’re More Like Me by M.E. Kerr (1977), Secret Lives by Berthe Amoss (1979), To All My Fans, With Love, From Sylvie by Ellen Conford (1982), and Me and Fat Glenda by Lila Perl (1972). . . .


Noting that many of the books of that era beloved by teen boys are still in print – such as Isaac Asimov’s novels and The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier – Skurnick pointed out that, in contrast, many of the books that were embraced by teen gir</p><p>2 0.93335485 <a title="1187-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-29-Stupid_legal_crap.html">58 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-29-Stupid legal crap</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ooooooh, I never ever thought I’d have a legitimate excuse to tell this story, and now I do!  The story took place many years ago, but first I have to tell you what made me think of it:
 
Rasmus Bååth  posted  the following comment last month:
  
On airplane tickets a Swedish “å” is written as “aa” resulting in Rasmus Baaaath. Once I bought a ticket online and five minutes later a guy from Lufthansa calls me and asks if I misspelled my name…
  
OK, now here’s my story (which is not nearly as good).  A long time ago (but when I was already an adult), I was in England for some reason, and I thought I’d take a day trip from London to Bath.  So here I am on line, trying to think of what to say at the ticket counter.  I remember that in England, they call Bath, Bahth.  So, should I ask for “a ticket to Bahth”?  I’m not sure, I’m afraid that it will sound silly, like I’m trying to fake an English accent.  So, when I get to the front of the line, I say, hesitantly, “I’d like a ticket to Bath?</p><p>6 0.91443723 <a title="1187-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-n_%3D_2.html">912 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-n = 2</a></p>

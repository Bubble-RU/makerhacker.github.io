To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.

I am reviewing a article with a whole bunch of tables with likert scale responses. You know, the standard thing with each question on its own line, followed by 5 columns of numbers.


Is there a good way to display this data graphically? OK, there’s no one best way, but can you point your readers to a few good examples?
  
My reply:  Some sort of small multiples.  I’m thinking of lineplots.  Maybe a grid of plots, each with three colored and labeled lines.  For example, it might be a grid with 10 rows and 5 columns.  To really know what to do, I’d have to have more sense of what’s being plotted.

I have some questions about some basic statistical ideas and would like your opinion on them:


1) Parameters that manifestly DON’T exist:


It makes good sense to me to think about Bayesian statistics as narrowing in on the value of parameters based on a model and some data. But there are cases where “the parameter” simply doesn’t make sense as an actual thing. Yet, it’s not really a complete fiction, like unicorns either, it’s some kind of “effective” thing maybe.


Here’s an example of what I mean. I did a simple toy experiment where we dropped crumpled up balls of paper and timed their fall times. (see here: http://models.street-artists.org/?s=falling+ball ) It was pretty instructive actually, and I did it to figure out how to in a practical way use an ODE to get a likelihood in MCMC procedures. One of the parameters in the model is the radius of the spherical ball of paper. But the ball of paper isn’t a sphere, not even approximately.

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.

I don’t think so.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

I like it.  Would it be possible to put the two long time series on the same scale?  As it is, one starts in 1948 and the other starts in 1980.  The only thing about the display that I really  don’t  like are those balls on the top indicating the duration of recessions.  It looks weird to me to display a time duration in the form of the area of a ball.</p><p>3 0.76452506 <a title="1116-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-27-%E2%80%9CGet_off_my_lawn%E2%80%9D-blogging.html">1432 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-27-“Get off my lawn”-blogging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  critiques  the recent pronouncements of sociologist and  cigarette shill  Peter Berger, who recently has moved into cultural criticism of New York’s mayor for living with “a woman to whom he is not married” (this is apparently a European sort of thing, I guess they don’t have unmarried partners in the parts of the U.S. where Berger hangs out).
 
But what impresses me is that Berger is doing  regular blogging   at the age of 84 , writing a long essay each week.  That’s really amazing to me.  Some of the blogging is a bit suspect, for example  the bit  where he claims that he personally could convert gays to heterosexual orientation (“A few stubborn individuals may resist the Berger conversion program. The majority will succumb”)—but, really, you gotta admire that he’s doing this.  I hope I’m that active when (if) I reach my mid-80s.  (As a nonsmoker, I should have a pretty good chance of reaching that point.)
 
P.S.   More rant  at the sister blog.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  news article and asks, Can this be right?
 
Hmmm . . . the article defines “wealthier smokers” as “those earning 60,000 or more.”  So suppose a “low-income smoker” makes $20K, then 25% is $5000, which is $100 a week, or $14/day, which according to the article is roughly the cost of a pack of cigarettes.  So I guess it’s possible.  It just depends where you put the cutoff for “low-income” and where you put the cutoff for “smoker.”  I also wonder whether the numerator and denominator are comparable.  It might be that if you add up all of these people’s expenses and divide by their income, you’ll get a ratio of more than 100%.</p><p>6 0.72312546 <a title="1116-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>

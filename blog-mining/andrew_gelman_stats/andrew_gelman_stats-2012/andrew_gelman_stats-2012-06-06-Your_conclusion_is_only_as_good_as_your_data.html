<p>Introduction: I just wrote this, and I realized it might be useful more generally:
  
The article looks reasonable to me–but I just did a shallow read and didn’t try to judge whether the conclusions are correct.  My main comment is that if they’re doing a Poisson regression, they should really be doing an overdispersed Poisson regression.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen data in my life where the non-overdispersed Poisson is appropriate.  Also, I’d like to see a before-after plot with dots for control cases and open circles for treatment cases and fitted regression lines drawn in.  Whenever there’s a regression I like to see this scatterplot.  The scatterplot isn’t a replacement for the regression, but at the very least it gives me intuition as to the scale of the estimated effect.  Finally, all their numbers should be rounded appropriately. 
  
Feel free to cut-and-paste this into your own referee reports (and to apply these recommendations in your own applied research).</p><p>3 0.14865188 <a title="1369-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-22-Ticket_to_Baaaaarf.html">2301 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-22-Ticket to Baaaaarf</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A link from the comments here took me to the wonderfully named  Barfblog  and a report by Don Schaffner on some reporting.
 
 First, the background:   A university in England issued a press release saying that “Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria than if it is left for longer periods of time . . . The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the ‘5 second rule’  – the urban myth about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped.”  According to the press release, the study was “undertaken by final year Biology students” and led by a professor of microbiology.
 
The press release hit the big time, hitting NPR, Slate, Forbes, the Daily News, etc etc.  Some typical headlines:

<p>Introduction: I encountered this  news article , “Chicago school bans some lunches brought from home”:
  
At Little Village, most students must take the meals served in the cafeteria or go hungry or both. . . . students are not allowed to pack lunches from home. Unless they have a medical excuse, they must eat the food served in the cafeteria. . . . Such discussions over school lunches and healthy eating echo a larger national debate about the role government should play in individual food choices.  “This is such a fundamental infringement on parental responsibility,” said J. Justin Wilson, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Center for Consumer Freedom, which is partially funded by the food industry. . . . For many CPS parents, the idea of forbidding home-packed lunches would be unthinkable. . . . 
  
If I had read this two years ago, I’d be at one with J. Justin Wilson and the outraged kids and parents.  But last year we spent a sabbatical in Paris, where . . . kids aren’t allowed to bring</p><p>5 0.10684478 <a title="1369-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-24-On_deck_this_month.html">2264 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-24-On deck this month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Atul Gawande (the thinking man’s Malcolm Gladwell)  asks :
  
Why do some innovations spread so swiftly and others so slowly? Consider the very different trajectories of surgical anesthesia and antiseptics, both of which were discovered in the nineteenth century. The first public demonstration of anesthesia was in 1846. The Boston surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow was approached by a local dentist named William Morton, who insisted that he had found a gas that could render patients insensible to the pain of surgery. That was a dramatic claim. In those days, even a minor tooth extraction was excruciating. Without effective pain control, surgeons learned to work with slashing speed. Attendants pinned patients down as they screamed and thrashed, until they fainted from the agony. Nothing ever tried had made much difference. Nonetheless, Bigelow agreed to let Morton demonstrate his claim.


On October 16, 1846, at Massachusetts General Hospital, Morton administered his gas through an inhaler in</p><p>3 0.80909175 <a title="1369-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-28-Creating_a_Lenin-style_democracy.html">2270 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-28-Creating a Lenin-style democracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  explains  why a penalty for getting the wrong answer on a test (the SAT, which is used in college admissions and which is used in the  famous  8 schools example) is  not  a “penalty for guessing.”  Then the very next day he catches this from Todd Balf in the New York Times Magazine: 
  
  
Students were docked one-quarter point for every multiple-choice question they got wrong, requiring a time-consuming risk analysis to determine which questions to answer and which to leave blank.
  
Ugh!  That just makes me want to . . . ok, I won’t go there.  Anyway, Palko  goes to the trouble  to explain:
  
While time management for a test like the SAT can be complicated, the rule for guessing is embarrassingly simple: give your best guess for questions you read; don’t waste time guessing on questions that you didn’t have time to read.


The risk analysis actually becomes much more complicated when you take away the penalty for guessing.

<p>Introduction: Amy Cohen points me to  this blog  by Jim Manzi, who writes:
  
 
 Ezra Klein  and a variety of other thoughtful liberal bloggers have been pointing to an Economic Policy Institute analysis that they claim demonstrates that Wisconsin’s public employees, even after adjusting for benefits and hours worked, face a ” compensation penalty of 5% for choosing to work in the public sector.” Unfortunately, when you get under the hood, the study shows no such thing. . . . reading the  actual paper  by Jeffrey H. Keefe is instructive. Keefe took a representative sample of Wisconsin workers, and built a regression model that relates “fundamental personal characteristics and labor market skills” to compensation, and then compared public to private sector employees, after “controlling” for these factors. As far as I can see, the factors adjusted for were: years of education; years of experience; gender; race; ethnicity; disability; size of organization where the employee works; and, hours worked per</p><p>5 0.80467319 <a title="1369-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-05-A_story_of_fake-data_checking_being_used_to_shoot_down_a_flawed_analysis_at_the_Farm_Credit_Agency.html">1884 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-05-A story of fake-data checking being used to shoot down a flawed analysis at the Farm Credit Agency</a></p>

Reading your posts on Unz and  political vs. economic discourse  made me think of that work again.  I thought I’d actually drop you a line on the subject.


Back in 2003 GAO was asked to look at Farmer Mac, including a look at the Farm Credit Agency’s regulation of Farmer Mac.  As the resident mortgage econometrician back then I was asked to look at FCA’s risk based capital stress test for Farmer Mac.  The work was pretty easy.  I found a lot of oddities, but the biggest one was that they were using a discrete choice set up (loan goes bad or doesn’t) instead of a hazard model (loan goes bad this period or survives to the next).  Not necessarily a problem – lots of mortgage models run that way.  But you have to be really careful with your independe</p><p>6 0.80202514 <a title="1369-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-05-Glenn_Hubbard_and_I_were_on_opposite_sides_of_a_court_case_and_I_didn%E2%80%99t_even_know_it%21.html">1707 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-05-Glenn Hubbard and I were on opposite sides of a court case and I didn’t even know it!</a></p>

I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>3 0.9675523 <a title="1369-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-25-Unlogging.html">485 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-25-Unlogging</a></p>

I [Bueker] am analyzing the effect of various contextual factors on the voter turnout of naturalized Latino citizens.  I have included the natural log of the number of Spanish Language ads run in each state during the election cycle to predict voter turnout.  I now want to calculate the predicted probabilities of turnout for those in states with 0 ads, 500 ads, 1000 ads, etc.  The problem is that I do not know how to handle the beta coefficient of the LN(Spanish language ads).  Is there someway to “unlog” the coefficient?
  
My reply:  Calculate these probabilities for specific values of predictors, then graph the predictions of interest.  Also, you can average over the other inputs in your model to get summaries.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko points me to a  news article  by Zack Beauchamp on Jason Richwine, the recent Ph.D. graduate from Harvard’s policy school who left the conservative Heritage Foundation after it came out that his Ph.D. thesis was said to be all  about  the low IQ’s of Hispanic immigrants.  Heritage and  others  apparently thought this association could discredit their anti-immigration-reform position.  Richwine’s mentor Charles Murray was  unhappy  about the whole episode.
 
Beauchamp’s article is worth reading in that it provides some interesting background, in particular by getting into the details of the Ph.D. review process.  In a sense, Beauchamp is too harsh.  Flawed Ph.D. theses get published all the time.  I’d say that  most  Ph.D. theses I’ve seen are flawed:  usually the plan is to get the papers into shape later, when submitting them to journals.  If a student doesn’t go into academia, the thesis typically just sits there and is rarely followed up on.

<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  points  to an excellent rant from Peter Moskos, trashing a study about “food deserts” (which I kept reading as “food desserts”) in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Here’s Moskos:
  
From the Times:

 
There is no relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents. 


Within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood, “you can get basically any type of food,” said Roland Sturm of the RAND Corporation, lead author of one of the studies. “Maybe we should call it a food swamp rather than a desert,” he said.
 

Sure thing, Sturm. But I suspect you wouldn’t think certain neighborhoods are swamped with good food if you actually got out of your office and went to one of the neighborhoods. After all, what are going to believe: A nice data set or your lying eyes?

A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

</p><p>5 They are both endurance events, they last a long time and they require a consistent and carefully calculated amount of effort to complete them and not burn out. [sent-14, score-0.547]
</p><p>6 But writing a dissertation is a not a single “event” and really doesn’t require “consistent” effort. [sent-15, score-0.635]
</p><p>7 Certainly not the kind of effort that you have a finite amount of energy for at the beginning of the process (which is what it is: a process not an event). [sent-16, score-0.199]
</p><p>8 It doesn’t really take endurance because you will be taking regular breaks and you’ll be recharging your energy every day. [sent-18, score-0.438]
</p><p>9 Writing a dissertation, then, is, if anything, like training for a marathon. [sent-22, score-0.169]
</p><p>10 It’s the preparation for the marathon, the regular training, running up to a half-marathon that actually improves your health. [sent-26, score-0.371]
</p><p>11 Running the marathon itself wears you down; it makes you less healthy. [sent-29, score-0.564]
</p><p>12 I see two appealing things about connecting a Ph. [sent-33, score-0.13]
</p><p>13 Both activities are similar to what came before (writing term papers for a student, training runs of a few miles for a marathoner) but are qualitatively different. [sent-36, score-0.265]
</p><p>14 A thesis is not (supposed to be) just a longer version of a term paper, and most of us can’t just run a marathon by extending our usual five-mile run for four hours. [sent-37, score-0.994]
</p><p>15 (I can testify to the latter; first my legs started to cramp up, then I started to get out of breath, and eventually I felt like my whole mind and body were disintegrating. [sent-38, score-0.437]
</p><p>16 On the downside, once I started to walk, it felt even worse. [sent-39, score-0.157]
</p><p>17 If you like graduate students and want them to be happy, it’s natural to want to say nice things about them. [sent-43, score-0.126]
</p><p>18 Saying a thesis is like running the marathon, that’s a respectful thing to say. [sent-44, score-0.488]
</p><p>19 There’s also this point, also from Basbøll:    Very few dissertation writers actually do either (sprint or run marathons). [sent-46, score-0.588]
</p><p>20 So to say that writing a dissertation is “like” these things is really to compare something writers (presumably) have a distorted view of with something they know very little about. [sent-47, score-0.704]

I [Hansen] signed up for my first marathon race. Everyone asks me my predicted time. The predictors online seem geared to or are based off of elite runners. And anyway they seem a bit limited.


So I decided to do some analysis of my own.
      
I was going to put together a web page where people could get their race time predictions, maybe sell some ads for sports gps watches, but it might also be publishable.


I have 2 requests which obviously I don’t want you to spend more than a few seconds on.


1. I was wondering if you knew of any sports performance researchers working on performance of not just elite athletes, but the full range of runners. 


2. Can you suggest a way to do multilevel modeling of this. There are several natural subsets for the data but it’s not obvious what makes sense. I describe the data below.


3. Phil (the runner/co-blogger who posted about weight loss) might be interested.

What would you like me to write about?  I’ll of course be writing quite a bit about what I’m now calling “article design”, i.e., how to map out the roughly forty paragraphs that a journal article is composed of. And I’ll also be talking about how to plan the writing process that is to produce those paragraphs. The basic principle is still to write at least one paragraph a day in 27 minutes. (You can adapt this is various ways to your own taste; some like 18-minute or even 13-minute paragraphs.)


But I’d like to talk about questions of style, too, and even a little bit about epistemology. “Knowledge—academic knowledge, that is—is the ability to compose a coherent prose paragraph about something in 27 minutes,” I always say.

<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>6 0.83001995 <a title="1351-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-19-Prose_is_paragraphs%2C_prose_is_sentences.html">1863 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-19-Prose is paragraphs, prose is sentences</a></p>

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.  Sure, traffic congestion is annoying, but there must be some advantages to driving on that crowded road or pe</p><p>2 0.9272666 <a title="1351-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-28-A_convenience_sample_and_selected_treatments.html">1551 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-28-A convenience sample and selected treatments</a></p>

A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>same-blog 4 0.9041611 <a title="1351-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-29-A_Ph.D._thesis_is_not_really_a_marathon.html">1351 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-29-A Ph.D. thesis is not really a marathon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

</p><p>2 My sense is that the sanctions should be brought into line by  adjusted the penalty substantially upward for the “scholars” & likely downward for guy like Lehrer (who actually is a talented guy; so much for “unity of the virtues”). [sent-7, score-0.24]

</p><p>4 I think the decisions we’ve seen involving misconduct make some sense if you consider the options and costs involved for the decision makers. [sent-14, score-0.171]
</p><p>5 Similarly, nobody wants the embarrassment of paying $20K or whatever to hear the stylings of a fabricator, not is the New Yorker going to sell a lot of copies to people who have a burning desire to learn the latest in faked and recycled science. [sent-20, score-0.182]
</p><p>6 I don’t know, but I feel that I recently got some insight into legal plagiarism after recently working as an expert witness in a court case (yup, I did it for the money). [sent-30, score-0.289]
</p><p>7 I did some work and wrote it up, then the people at the law firm rewrote it to be in the standard format for an expert witness report. [sent-31, score-0.206]
</p><p>8 I asked the lawyers if this was OK, and they said Yes, my name on it means that I stand behind it, not that I wrote every word. [sent-34, score-0.206]
</p><p>9 Anyway, I assume that lawyers such as Tribe and Ayres have lots of experience putting their names on reports that they have not written, and this is standard practice. [sent-36, score-0.206]
</p><p>10 And, to the extent that a lot of organizations are run by lawyers (or run things by lawyers), that might explain a general level of tolerance toward such offenses, especially in law schools. [sent-42, score-0.267]

<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.2220194 <a title="1442-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-08-Another_Wegman_plagiarism.html">751 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-08-Another Wegman plagiarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the time of our last  discussion , Edward Wegman, a statistics professor who has also worked for government research agencies, had been involved in three cases of plagiarism:  a report for the U.S. Congress on climate models, a paper on social networks, a paper on color graphics.
 
Each of the plagiarism stories was slightly different:  the congressional report involved the distorted copying of research by a scientist (Raymond Bradley) whose conclusions Wegman disagreed with, the social networks paper included copied material in its background section, and the color graphics paper included various bits and pieces by others that had been used in old lecture notes.
 
Since then, blogger Deep Climate has  uncovered  another plagiarized article by Wegman, this time an article in a 2005 volume on data mining and data visualization.  Deep Climate writes, “certain sections of Statistical Data Mining rely heavily on lightly edited portions on lectures from Wegman’s statistical data mining c</p><p>5 0.18565747 <a title="1442-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-10-Chris_Chabris_is_irritated_by_Malcolm_Gladwell.html">2057 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-10-Chris Chabris is irritated by Malcolm Gladwell</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christopher Chabris  reviewed  the new book by Malcolm Gladwell:
  
One thing “David and Goliath” shows is that Mr. Gladwell has not changed his own strategy, despite serious criticism of his prior work. What he presents are mostly just intriguing possibilities and musings about human behavior, but what his publisher sells them as, and what his readers may incorrectly take them for, are lawful, causal rules that explain how the world really works. Mr. Gladwell should acknowledge when he is speculating or working with thin evidentiary soup. Yet far from abandoning his hand or even standing pat, Mr. Gladwell has doubled down. This will surely bring more success to a Goliath of nonfiction writing, but not to his readers.
  
Afterward he blogged some further thoughts about the popular popular science writer.   Good stuff .  Chabris has a thoughtful explanation of why the “Gladwell is just an entertainer” alibi doesn’t work for him (Chabris).

<p>Introduction: I just finished reading an amusing but somewhat disturbing  article  by Mark Singer, a reporter for the New Yorker who follows in that magazine’s tradition of writing about amiable frauds.  (For those who are keeping score at home, Singer employs a McKelway-style relaxed tolerance rather than Liebling-style pyrotechnics.)  Singer’s topic was a midwestern dentist named Kip Litton who fradulently invented a side career for himself as a sub-3-hour marathoner.  What was amazing was not so much that Litton lied about his accomplishments but, rather, the huge efforts that he undertook to support these lies.  He went to faraway cities to not run marathons.  He fabricated multiple personas on running message boards.  He even invented an entire marathon and made up a list of participants.
 
This got me thinking about Ed Wegman (sorry!), the statistician who got tangled in a  series of plagiarism scandals .  As with Litton, once Wegman was caught once, energetic people looked at the records and</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93641639 <a title="1442-lsi-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-03-Double_standard%3F__Plagiarizing_journos_get_slammed%2C_plagiarizing_profs_just_shrug_it_off.html">1442 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-03-Double standard?

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: A  correspondent  writes:
  
A brief update on the  Stapel scandal . It seems that the Dutch universities involved were really determined to get to the bottom of this. A first part of the outcomes of the investigations are online (in English).  Several “commissions” or “committees” (I guess no proper English but this is the way scandals are sorted out in Dutch politics too) were established to investigate the matter.


The first commission to report is the commissie Levelt:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/


The most interesting part is this I guess:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/levelt-committee/fraud-determined/ 


This concerns only the articles investigated by that commission. The others (Noort and Drenth) are expected to report in the coming months.


I [the correspondent] feel sorry for Stapel, but the amount of fraud is sizeable. I like the way the universities handle this—especially that they are fairly transparent.
  
Interesting. This all seems like overkill given how obvio</p><p>5 0.91125417 <a title="1442-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Last_Wegman_post_%28for_now%29.html">766 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Last Wegman post (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  news article  by Eli Kintisch with the following wonderful quote:
  
Will Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who questions the consensus view on climate, thinks Mashey is a destructive force who uses “totalitarian tactics”–publishing damaging documents online, without peer review–to carry out personal vendettas.
  
I’ve never thought of uploading files as “totalitarian” but maybe they do things differently at Princeton.  I actually think of totalitarians as acting secretly–denunciations without evidence, midnight arrests, trials in undisclosed locations, and so forth.  Mashey’s practice of putting everything out in the open seems to me the opposite of totalitarian.
 
The article also reports that Edward Wegman’s lawyer said that Wegman “has never engaged in plagiarism.”  If I were the lawyer, I’d be pretty mad at Wegman at this point.  I can just imagine the conversation:

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes on what seems to be the  topic  of the  week :
  
In reflecting on  Lehrer , I [Kahan] have to wonder why the sanction is so much more severe — basically career “death penalty” subject to parole [I think he means "life imprisonment" --- ed.], I suppose, if he manages decades of “good behavior” — for this science journalist when scholars who stick plagiarized material in their “popular science” writing don’t even get slap on wrist — more like shrug of the shoulders. I do think the behavior is comparable; if anything, it’s probably “less wrong” to make up innocuous filler quotes (the Dylan one is, for sure), then to stick paragraphs of someone else’s writing into a book. But the cause is the same: laziness. (The plagarism I’m talking about is not the sort done by Wegman; its sort done by scholars who use factory production techniques to write popular press books —  teams of research assistants who write memos, which the “author” then knits together & passes off as learne</p><p>2 0.96878761 <a title="1442-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-16-Another_day%2C_another_plagiarist.html">1266 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-16-Another day, another plagiarist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>3 0.96807873 <a title="1442-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-23-Combining_survey_data_obtained_using_different_modes_of_sampling.html">777 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-23-Combining survey data obtained using different modes of sampling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m involved (with Irv Garfinkel and others) in a planned survey of New York City residents.  It’s hard to reach people in the city–not everyone will answer their mail or phone, and you can’t send an interviewer door-to-door in a locked apartment building.  (I think it violates IRB to have a plan of pushing all the buzzers by the entrance and hoping someone will let you in.)  So the plan is to use multiple modes, including phone, in person household, random street intercepts and mail.
 
The question then is how to combine these samples.  My suggested approach is to divide the population into poststrata based on various factors (age, ethnicity, family type, housing type, etc), then to pool responses within each poststratum, then to runs some regressions including postratsta and also indicators for mode, to understand how respondents from different modes differ, after controlling for the demographic/geographic adjustments.
 
Maybe this has already been done and written up somewhere?

<p>Introduction: Astrophysicist Andrew Jaffe pointed me to  this and discussion  of my  philosophy  of statistics (which is, in turn, my rational reconstruction of the statistical practice of Bayesians such as Rubin and Jaynes).  Jaffe’s summary is fair enough and I only disagree in a few points: 
   
1.  Jaffe writes:
  
Subjective probability, at least the way it is actually used by practicing scientists, is a sort of “as-if” subjectivity — how would an agent reason if her beliefs were reflected in a certain set of probability distributions? This is why when I discuss probability I try to make the pedantic point that all probabilities are conditional, at least on some background prior information or context.
  
I agree, and my problem with the usual procedures used for Bayesian model comparison and Bayesian model averaging is not that these approaches are subjective but that the particular models being considered don’t make sense.  I’m thinking of the sorts of models that say the truth is either A or</p><p>5 0.96612006 <a title="1442-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-21-Discussion_of_the_paper_by_Girolami_and_Calderhead_on_Bayesian_computation.html">288 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-21-Discussion of the paper by Girolami and Calderhead on Bayesian computation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s my discussion of  this article  for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
 
I will comment on this paper in my role as applied statistician and consumer of Bayesian computation.  In the last few years, my colleagues and I have felt the need to fit predictive survey responses given multiple discrete predictors, for example estimating voting given ethnicity and income within each of the fifty states, or estimating public opinion about gay marriage given age, sex, ethnicity, education, and state.  We would like to be able to fit such models with ten or more predictors–for example, religion, religious attendance, marital status, and urban/rural/suburban residence in addition to the factors mentioned above.
 
There are (at least) three reasons for fitting a model with many predictive factors and potentially a huge number of interactions among them:

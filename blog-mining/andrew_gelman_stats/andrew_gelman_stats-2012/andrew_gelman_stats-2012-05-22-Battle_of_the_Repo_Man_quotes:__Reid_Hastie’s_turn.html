</p><p>2 In contrast, I don’t believe that mathematical thinking has those properties. [sent-7, score-0.152]
</p><p>3 (Here I mean stylized mathematical thinking that goes beyond counting – such as algebra or geometry and more elaborate forms of this capacity. [sent-8, score-0.37]

</p><p>5 Though we are pretty good at some elaborate forms of “natural deduction” that are best described as rule-based. [sent-11, score-0.199]

</p><p>8 But, every so often you have to bet on a new theoretical development, and I’m placing a wager on Bayesian Causal Networks … I certainly have not won that bet yet. [sent-19, score-0.194]
</p><p>9 (I also think Andrew is right that most realistic causal systems studied in the behavioural and biological sciences are defined by many small-influence causal relations and the current versions of Bayesian Causal Networks may not be a practically useful framework for modeling those phenomena. [sent-20, score-0.63]
</p><p>10 I am not apologetic about my choice of the Tversky & Kahneman causal conjunction brainteaser:  Which is more likely “A flood drowns 1,000 Californians” versus “An earthquake followed by a flood drowns 1,000 Californians”? [sent-22, score-0.786]
</p><p>11 Andrew says he does not see how this example demonstrates a problem with logical thinking skills. [sent-28, score-0.214]
</p><p>12 My answer is not subtle; I just buy the Tversky-Kahneman conclusion that there is an implied violation of logical set-superset membership relationships when we rate the probability of a conjunction higher than the probability of a component category. [sent-29, score-0.227]
</p><p>13 If you don’t accept that interpretation, you can certainly argue the alternative (see my list of methodological weaknesses above, plus the fact that different samples of respondents made the ratings that I claim “violate the logical principle”). [sent-30, score-0.193]
</p><p>14 I’m not sure how to respond to the criticism that my claim that many interpretations of the recent financial crises are examples of narrative fallacies is actually motivated by my desire to excuse specific individuals and institutions from responsibility for the crises. [sent-33, score-0.65]
</p><p>15 I can say it was certainly not my intention to excuse bankers and others from responsibility when I included that example. [sent-34, score-0.351]
</p><p>16 Again, I thought I was providing an illustration that typical Bloomberg readers could understand; and that I was warning them not to commit the fallacy in their professional roles – and especially to be more modest about their own abilities to forecast future events. [sent-35, score-0.224]
</p><p>17 If I were to characterize my own views on responsibility for the recent financial events, I would say that many bankers, analysts, raters, regulators, and politicians should be punished, much more harshly than they have been (or will be). [sent-37, score-0.368]
</p><p>18 )  In any case, the reaction to my citation of (some) discussions of the financial crisis as examples of the “narrative fallacy” was an unintended consequence and I’m grateful to the blog for pointing that out. [sent-40, score-0.252]
</p><p>19 That too was unintended (though maybe that’s not very remarkable, who sets out to intentionally write an article that sounds smug – maybe the occasional humorist). [sent-43, score-0.15]
</p><p>20 That’s probably a reason that many popular science writers get in trouble. [sent-46, score-0.149]

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor points me to an  opinion piece  by psychologist Reid Hastie, “Our Gift for Good Stories Blinds Us to the Truth.”
 
I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.  That could be fine—after all, Hastie is a distinguished psychology researcher—but I wasn’t so clear that he’s so clear on what he’s saying.  For example:
  
The human brain is designed to support two modes of thought: visual and narrative. These forms of thinking are universal across human societies throughout history, develop reliably early in individuals’ lives</p><p>3 0.16955841 <a title="1336-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-16-Long_discussion_about_causal_inference_and_the_use_of_hierarchical_models_to_bridge_between_different_inferential_settings.html">1418 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-16-Long discussion about causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent. In other words, if one agrees with the assumptions encoded in the model, one must also agree with the conclusions entailed by these assumptions. I am not aware of any other way of doing mathematics.

<p>Introduction: Judea Pearl is starting an (online) Journal of Causal Inference.  The first issue is planned for Fall 2011 and the  website  is now open for submissions.  Here’s the background (from Pearl):
  
Existing discipline-specific journals tend to bury causal analysis in the language and methods of traditional statistical methodologies, creating the inaccurate impression that causal questions can be handled by routine methods of regression, simultaneous equations or logical implications, and glossing over the special ingredients  needed for causal analysis.  In contrast, Journal of Causal Inference highlights both the uniqueness and interdisciplinary nature of causal research.


In addition to significant original research articles, Journal of Causal Inference also welcomes: 
1) Submissions that synthesize and assess cross-disciplinary methodological research 
2) Submissions that discuss the history of the causal inference field and its philosophical underpinnings 
3) Unsolicited short communi</p><p>5 0.15073244 <a title="1336-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-15-Forward_causal_reasoning_statements_are_about_estimation%3B_reverse_causal_questions_are_about_model_checking_and_hypothesis_generation.html">1939 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-15-Forward causal reasoning statements are about estimation; reverse causal questions are about model checking and hypothesis generation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>6 0.1272821 <a title="1336-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  an article  published in 2001, Pearl wrote:
  
I [Pearl] turned Bayesian in 1971, as soon as I began reading Savage’s monograph The Foundations of Statistical Inference [Savage, 1962]. The arguments were unassailable: (i) It is plain silly to ignore what we know, (ii) It is natural and useful to cast what we know in the language of probabilities, and (iii) If our subjective probabilities are erroneous, their impact will get washed out in due time, as the number of observations increases.


Thirty years later, I [Pearl] am still a devout Bayesian in the sense of (i), but I now doubt the wisdom of (ii) and I know that, in general, (iii) is false.
  
He elaborates:
  
The bulk of human knowledge is organized around causal, not probabilistic relationships, and the grammar of probability calculus is insufficient for capturing those relationships. Specifically, the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as “mud does not cause rain” and “symptom</p><p>3 0.80538017 <a title="1336-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-14-I_hate_to_get_all_Gerd_Gigerenzer_on_you_here%2C_but_._._..html">1319 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-14-I hate to get all Gerd Gigerenzer on you here, but . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  See section 4 of  this article .
 
More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein pointed me to  this  post by Michael Nielsen on how to teach Simpson’s paradox.
 
I don’t know if Nielsen (and others) are aware that people have developed some snappy graphical methods for displaying Simpson’s paradox (and, more generally, aggregation issues).  We do some this in our Red State Blue State book, but before that was the BK plot,  named by Howard Wainer  after a 2001 paper by Stuart Baker and Barnett Kramer, although in apparently appeared earlier in a 1987 paper by Jeon, Chung, and Bae, and doubtless was made by various other people before then.
 
Here’s Wainer’s graphical explication from 2002 (adapted from Baker and Kramer’s 2001 paper):
 
 
 
   
Here’s the version from our 2007 article (with Boris Shor, Joe Bafumi, and David Park):
 
 
 
But I recommend  Wainer’s article  (linked to above) as the first thing to read on the topic of presenting aggregation paradoxes in a clear and grabby way.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

I have just finished my Ph.D. in statistics and am currently working in applied statistics (plant ecology) using Bayesian statistics.  As the statistician in the group I only ever get the ‘hard analysis’ problems that don’t readily fit into standard models.  As I delve into the computational aspects of Bayesian analysis, I find myself increasingly frustrated with the current set of tools.  I was delighted to see  JAGS 2.0  just came out and spent yesterday happily playing with it.


My question is, where do you see the short-term future of Bayesian computing going and what can we do to steer it in a particular direction?
      
In your book with Dr Hill, you mention that you expect BUGS (or its successor) to become increasingly sophisticated and, for example, re-parameterizations that increase convergence rates would be handled automatically.

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>same-blog 4 0.95907575 <a title="1336-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-22-Battle_of_the_Repo_Man_quotes%3A__Reid_Hastie%E2%80%99s_turn.html">1336 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-22-Battle of the Repo Man quotes:  Reid Hastie’s turn</a></p>

Andrew (and Commenters) … I’d like to try to clarify some of the statements and implications in my Bloomberg article on “Our Gift for Good Stories …”  The essay is what it is, but some of the implications that I intended to convey do not seem to have been communicated effectively.  So, let me take a shot at clarification here.  (Of course I am not assuming that, once clarified, my statements are necessarily correct or that you will agree with them.)

What I meant in the sections of the paper that claimed the brain is naturally good at visual and causal (narrative) thinking, is that that the brain was probably selected, through evolutionary processes to be adaptively successful at those capacities.

I’m happy to see you’ve articulated similar gripes I had w/ the piece, which makes me feel like I’m not crazy. I remember discussing this with colleagues (I work at a research institute w/ economists) and only a couple of them shared any concern. It seems that by virtue of being published in ‘the AER’ the results are unquestionable. I agree that the idea is interesting and worth pursuing but as you say it’s one thing to go from that to asserting ‘causality’ (I still don’t know what definition of causality they’re using?). All the data torture along the way is just tipping the hat to convention rather than serving any scientific purpose.

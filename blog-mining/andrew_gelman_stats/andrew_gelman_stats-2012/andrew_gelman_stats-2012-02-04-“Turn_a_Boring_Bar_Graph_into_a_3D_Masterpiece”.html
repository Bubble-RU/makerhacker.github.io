<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points us to  an article  by Shaaron Ainsworth, Vaughan Prain, and Russell Tytler:
  
Should science learners be challenged to draw more? Certainly making visualizations is integral to scientific thinking. Scientists do not use words only but rely on diagrams, graphs, videos, photographs, and other images to make discoveries, explain findings, and excite public interest. . . . However, in the science classroom, learners mainly focus on interpreting others’ visualizations; when drawing does occur, it is rare that learners are systematically encouraged to create their own visual forms to develop and show understanding (6). Drawing includes constructing a line graph from a table of values, sketching cells observed through a microscope, or inventing a way to show a scientific phenomenon (e.g., evaporation). Although interpretation of visualizations and other information is clearly critical to learning, becoming proficient in science also requires learners to develop many</p><p>3 0.090304278 <a title="1154-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Amtrak_sucks.html">1255 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Amtrak sucks</a></p>

I don’t think so.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

<p>Introduction: I love reading the kind of English that English people write.  It’s the same language as American but just slightly different.  I was thinking about this recently after coming across this footnote from “Yeah Yeah Yeah:  The Story of Modern Pop,” by Bob Stanley:
  
Mantovani’s atmospheric arrangement on ‘Care Mia’, I should add, is something else.  Genuinely celestial.  If anyone with a degree of subtlety was singing, it would be quite a record.
  
It’s hard for me to pin down exactly what makes this passage specifically English, but there’s something about it . . .
 
P.S.  Mark Liberman  reports  that, in combination, several of the words and phrases in the above quote indeed supply strong evidence (“odds of better than 50 to 1 in favor of a British origin”).</p><p>6 0.053568799 <a title="1154-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-28-Explaining_that_plot..html">631 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-28-Explaining that plot.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Seth writes:
  
 Here’s  my candidate for bad graphic of the year:


   


I [Seth] studied it and learned nothing. I have no idea how they assigned colors to locations. I already knew that there were more within-city calls than calls to individual distant locations — for example that there are more SF-SF calls than SF-LA calls. The researchers took a huge rich database and boiled it down to nothing (in terms of information value) — and I have a funny feeling they don’t realize how awful this is and what a waste.


I send it to you because it isn’t obvious how to do better — at least not obvious to them.
  
My reply:
 
My first reaction is to agree–I don’t get anything out of this graph either! But let me step back.
 
I think it’s best to understand this using the framework of  my paper with Antony Unwin , by thinking of the goals that are satisfied by different sorts of graphs.

<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.  On the other hand, if Evgn and I were working together on such a graph, we w</p><p>4 0.73771006 <a title="1154-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-Decision_science_vs._social_psychology.html">305 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-Decision science vs. social psychology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein sends along  this bit of research , distinguishing terms used in two different subfields of psychology.  Dan writes:
  
Intuitive calls included not listing words that don’t occur 3 or more times in both programs. I [Dan] did this because when I looked at the results, those cases tended to be proper names or arbitrary things like header or footer text.  It also narrowed down the space of words to inspect, which means I could actually get the thing done in my copious free time.
  
I think the bar graphs are kinda ugly, maybe there’s a better way to do it based on classifying the words according to content?  Also the whole exercise would gain a new dimension by comparing several areas instead of just two.  Maybe that’s coming next.</p><p>5 0.73599738 <a title="1154-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-29-I%E2%80%99m_looking_for_a_quadrille_notebook_with_faint_lines.html">1235 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-29-I’m looking for a quadrille notebook with faint lines</a></p>

My problem with the notebook I have now is that the ink is too heavy—that is, the lines are too dark.  I want very faint lines, just visible enough to be used as guides but not so heavy that to be overwhelming.

<p>Introduction: On the back of my yellowing pocket book of “The Mask of Dimitros” is the following blurb:
  
‘Eric Ambler is the best living writer of thrillers.’ — News Chonicle
  
What I’m wondering is, why the qualifier “living”?  Did the News Chronicle think there was a better writers of thrillers than Ambler who was no longer alive?  I can’t imagine who that could be, considering that Ambler pretty much defined the modern thriller.</p><p>2 0.8128196 <a title="1154-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert_update%3A__cartooning_can_give_you_the_strength_to_open_jars_with_your_bare_hands.html">664 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert update:  cartooning can give you the strength to open jars with your bare hands</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>3 0.80756915 <a title="1154-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Gregor_Mendel%E2%80%99s_suspicious_data.html">1449 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Gregor Mendel’s suspicious data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points me to a  thoughtful discussion  by Moti Nissani on “Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox.”
 
The paradox, as Nissani defines it, is that Mendel’s data seem in many cases too good to be true, yet Mendel had a reputation for probity and it seems doubtful that he had a Mark-Hauser-style attitude toward reporting scientific data.  Nissani writes:
  
Taken together, the situation seems paradoxical. On the one hand, we have evidence that “the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel’s expectations.” We also have good reasons to believe that Mendel encountered linkage but failed to report it and that he may have taken the somewhat unusual step of having his scientific records destroyed shortly after his death. On the other hand, everything else we know about him/in addition to his undisputed genius/suggests a man of unimpeachable integrity, fine observational powers, and a pa</p><p>4 0.80263746 <a title="1154-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-19-Thiel_update.html">525 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-19-Thiel update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.


Firstly, just because someone is a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, or any kind of successful entrepreneur for that matter, doesn’t mean they should be trusted with oth</p><p>5 0.78924483 <a title="1154-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-26-Antman_again_courts_controversy.html">973 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-26-Antman again courts controversy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>same-blog 6 0.78394556 <a title="1154-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-04-%E2%80%9CTurn_a_Boring_Bar_Graph_into_a_3D_Masterpiece%E2%80%9D.html">1154 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-04-“Turn a Boring Bar Graph into a 3D Masterpiece”</a></p>

</p><p>3 Science reporters and authors keep bombarding us with stories of success in data mining, when in fact most statistical models in the social sciences have high rates of error. [sent-8, score-0.235]
</p><p>4 For example, one of the subheads in the chapter about a baseball player performance forecasting system he developed prior to entering the world of political polls reads: “PECOTA Versus Scouts: Scouts Win. [sent-14, score-0.283]
</p><p>5 After reading Silver’s book, you should be thinking critically about how predictions are evaluated (and in some cases, how they may be impossible to verify). [sent-18, score-0.203]
</p><p>6 Cathy O’Neil is  more critical :    As a modeler myself, I am extremely concerned about how models affect the public, so the book’s success is wonderful news. [sent-31, score-0.278]
</p><p>7 It would be reasonable for Silver to tell us about his baseball models . [sent-42, score-0.243]
</p><p>8 What is not reasonable, however, is for Silver to claim to understand how the financial crisis was a result of a few inaccurate models, and how medical research need only switch from being frequentist to being Bayesian to become more accurate. [sent-49, score-0.287]
</p><p>9 But each example is actually a success (for the insiders) if you look at a slightly larger picture and understand the incentives inside the system. [sent-62, score-0.198]
</p><p>10 We didn’t have a financial crisis because of a bad model or a few bad models. [sent-66, score-0.308]
</p><p>11 We had bad models because of a corrupt and criminally fraudulent financial system. [sent-67, score-0.308]
</p><p>12 That’s an important distinction, because we could fix a few bad models with a few good mathematicians, but we can’t fix the entire system so easily. [sent-68, score-0.351]
</p><p>13 )  This assumption generally holds in his experience: poker, baseball, and polling are all arenas in which one’s incentive is to be as accurate as possible. [sent-75, score-0.193]
</p><p>14 [But] the flaws in these medical models will be hard to combat, because they advance the interests of the insiders: competition among academic researchers to publish and get tenure is fierce, and there are enormous financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies. [sent-84, score-0.456]
</p><p>15 The bad models are a consequence of misaligned incentives. [sent-90, score-0.192]
</p><p>16 He spends very little time on the question of how people act inside larger systems, where a given modeler might be more interested in keeping their job or getting a big bonus than in making their model as accurate as possible. [sent-96, score-0.21]
</p><p>17 This comports with my impression that Nate is a hard worker and an excellent analyst who can get right to the point of whatever he is studying. [sent-120, score-0.279]
</p><p>18 Kaiser’s review is positive because he’s treating The Signal and the Noise as a pop-statistics book along the lines of Freakonomics, and he (Kaiser) is happy to see Nate’s openness and questioning spirit, allied with solid practical recommendations. [sent-126, score-0.274]
</p><p>19 Nate considers non-statistical issues in some small cases (for example, when writing about the varying incentives of different groups of weather forecasters) but is, according to Cathy, too accepting of face-value motivations when discussing finance, medicine, and politics. [sent-132, score-0.29]
</p><p>20 Even while we recognize that people often have strong motivations to make inaccurate predictions when money and reputations are on the line. [sent-134, score-0.196]

<p>Introduction: Jeff the Productivity Sapper points me to  this insulting open letter to Nate Silver  written by pollster John Zogby.  I’ll go through bits of Zogby’s note line by line.  (Conflict of interest warning:  I have collaborated with Nate and I blog on his site).
  
Zogby writes:  Here is some advice from someone [Zogby] who has been where you [Silver] are today.
  
Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.
  
Zogby writes:  You [Nate] are hot right now – using an aggregate of other people’s work, you got 49 of 50 states right in 2008.
  
Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.

<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>4 0.21231055 <a title="1634-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Yes%2C_checking_calibration_of_probability_forecasts_is_part_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">1610 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics.  At the end of this post are three figures from Chapter 1 of Bayesian Data Analysis illustrating empirical evaluation of forecasts.
 
But first the background.  Why am I bringing this up now?  It’s because of something Larry Wasserman  wrote the other day : 
  
  
One of the striking facts about [baseball/political forecaster Nate Silver's recent] book is the emphasis the Silver places on frequency calibration. . . . Have no doubt about it: Nate Silver is a frequentist. For example, he says:

 
One of the most important tests of a forecast — I would argue that it is the single most important one — is called calibration. Out of all the times you said there was a 40 percent chance of rain, how often did rain actually occur? If over the long run, it really did rain about 40 percent of the time, that means your forecasts were well calibrated.

<p>Introduction: This  is sooooo cool.  The actual statistical methods they are using are pretty crude, but that’s fine.  What’s important is their focus on the important goal.  It’s sort of like Bill James or Nate Silver:  if you’re using good information, and you’re focused on good questions, then the fancy statistics can come later (or from others).
 
In most educational efforts I know of (including my own), very little is done to target assessments to improvements for individual students.  I really like what they’re doing here and it reminds me how I want to figure out how to do something similar in my own teaching and course materials.</p><p>6 0.19565985 <a title="1634-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-03-Some_thoughts_on_election_forecasting.html">391 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-03-Some thoughts on election forecasting</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Eric Novik does some open-source  planning :
  
My co-author, Jacki Buros, and I [Novik] have just signed a contract with Apress to write a book tentatively entitled “Predictive Analytics with R”, which will cover programming best practices, data munging, data exploration, and single and multi-level models with case studies in social media, healthcare, politics, marketing, and the stock market.


Why does the world need another R book?  We think there is a shortage of books that deal with the complete and programmer centric analysis of real, dirty, and sometimes unstructured data.  Our target audience are people who have some familiarity with statistics, but do not have much experience with programming. . . .


The book is projected to be about 300 pages across 8 chapters. This is my first experience with writing a book and everything I heard about the process tells me that this is going to be a long and arduous endeavor lasting anywhere from 6 to 8 months.

<p>Introduction: Business statistician  Kaiser Fung  just came out with another book, this one full of stories about how organizations use data:
 
1.  Why do law school deans send each other junk mail?
 
2.  Can a new statistic make us less fat?
 
3.  How can sellouts ruin a business?
 
4.  Will personalizing deals save Groupon?
 
5.  Why do marketers send you mixed messages?
 
6.  Are they new jobs if no one can apply?
 
7.  How much did you pay for the eggs?
 
8.  Are you a better coach or manager?
 
Unlike most books of this sort, there’s no hero:  These are not stories about a fabulous businessman who made millions of dollars by following his dream and taking the customer seriously, nor are they Gladwellian sagas of brilliant scientists, nor are they auto-Gladwellian tales of the Ariely variety.

<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>5 0.7248317 <a title="1634-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-29-Auto-Gladwell%2C_or_Can_fractals_be_used_to_predict_human_history%3F.html">11 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-29-Auto-Gladwell, or Can fractals be used to predict human history?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just reviewed the book Bursts, by Albert-László Barabási, for Physics Today.  But I had a lot more to say that couldn’t fit into the magazine’s 800-word limit.  Here I’ll reproduce what I sent to Physics Today, followed by my additional thoughts.
  
The back cover of Bursts book promises “a revolutionary new theory showing how we can predict human behavior.”  I wasn’t fully convinced on that score, but the book does offer a well-written and thought-provoking window into author Albert-László Barabási’s research in power laws and network theory.


Power laws–the mathematical pattern that little things are common and large things are rare–have been observed in many different domains, including incomes (as noted by economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth century), word frequencies (as noted by linguist George Zipf), city sizes, earthquakes, and virtually anything else that can be measured.

<p>Introduction: People keep asking me what I think of Nate’s book, and I keep replying that, as a blogger, I’m spoiled.  I’m so used to getting books for free that I wouldn’t go out and buy a book just for the purpose of reviewing it.  (That reminds me that I should post reviews of some of those books I’ve received in the mail over the past few months.)
 
I have, however, encountered a couple of reviews of The Signal and the Noise so I thought I’d pass them on to you.  Both these reviews are by statisticians / data scientists who work here in NYC in the non-academic “real world” so in that sense they are perhaps better situated than me to review the book (also, they have not collaborated with Nate so they have no conflict of interest).
 
Kaiser Fung gives a  positive review :
  
It is in the subtitle—“why so many predictions fail – but some don’t”—that one learns the core philosophy of Silver: he is most concerned with the honest evaluation of the performance of predictive models.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Robinson writes:
  
I’m a survey researcher who mostly does political work, but I also have a strong interest in economics.  I have a question about this graph you commonly see in the economics literature. It is of a concept called the Beveridge Curve [recently in the newspaper  here ]. It is one of the more interesting concepts in labor economics, relating the vacancy rate in jobs to the unemployment rate. A  good primer is  here .


However, despite being one of the more interesting concepts in economics, the way it is displayed visually is nothing short of atrocious:


 


These graphs are nothing short of unreadable and pretty much the standard (Brad Delong has linked to this graph above and it can appear like this in publication as well). I’ve only really seen one representation of the curve that is more clear than this and it is at  this link :

<p>Introduction: Economist Stan Liebowitz has a  longstanding interest  in the difficulties of flagging published research errors.  Recently he wrote on the related topic of dishonest authorship:
  
While not about direct research fraud, I thought you might be interested in  this paper . It discusses the manner in which credit is given for economics articles, and I suspect it applies to many other areas as well. One of the conclusions is that the lack of complete proration per author will lead to excessive coauthorship, reducing overall research output by inducing the use of larger than efficient-sized teams. Under these circumstances, false authorship can be a response to the warped reward system and false authorship might improve research efficiency since it might keep actual research teams (as opposed to nominal teams) from being too large to produce research efficiently. One of the questions I rhetorically ask in the paper is whether anyone has ever been ‘punished’ for having their name included on</p><p>4 0.96038854 <a title="1634-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-03-Some_thoughts_on_election_forecasting.html">391 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-03-Some thoughts on election forecasting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc., or see here for a  more technical paper  with Kari Lock) but had a few things to add in light of Sam Wang’s  recent efforts . As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.  I</p><p>5 0.95863974 <a title="1634-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-30-You_can%E2%80%99t_put_Pandora_back_in_the_box.html">120 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-30-You can’t put Pandora back in the box</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  writes :
  
I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed.

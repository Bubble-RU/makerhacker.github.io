<p>Introduction: I think cross-validation is a good way to estimate a model’s forecasting error but I don’t think it’s always such a great tool for comparing models.  I mean, sure, if the differences are dramatic, ok.  But you can easily have a few candidate models, and one model makes a lot more sense than the others (even from a purely predictive sense, I’m not talking about causality here).  The difference between the model doesn’t show up in a xval measure of total error but in the patterns of the predictions.
 
For a simple example, imagine using a linear model with positive slope to model a function that is constrained to be increasing.  If the constraint isn’t in the model, the predicted/imputed series will sometimes be nonmonotonic.  The effect on the prediction error can be so tiny as to be undetectable (or it might even increase avg prediction error to include the constraint); nonetheless, the predictions will be clearly nonsensical.
 
That’s an extreme example but I think the general point h</p><p>3 0.18088281 <a title="1441-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-10-Cross-validation_and_Bayesian_estimation_of_tuning_parameters.html">2129 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-10-Cross-validation and Bayesian estimation of tuning parameters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Lipkovich writes:
  
I read with great interest your 2008  paper  [with Aleks Jakulin, Grazia Pittau, and Yu-Sung Su] on weakly informative priors for logistic regression and also followed an interesting discussion on your blog. This discussion was within Bayesian community in relation to the validity of priors. However i would like to approach it rather from a more broad perspective on predictive modeling bringing in the ideas from machine/statistical learning approach”.  Actually you were the first to bring it up by mentioning in your paper “borrowing ideas from computer science” on cross-validation when comparing predictive ability of your proposed priors with other choices.


However, using cross-validation for comparing method performance is not the only or primary use of CV in machine-learning. Most of machine learning methods have some “meta” or complexity parameters and use cross-validation to tune them up. For example, one of your comparison methods is BBR which actually</p><p>4 0.14323106 <a title="1441-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-27-Question_17_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1348 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-27-Question 17 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

 Solution to question 16 
 
From  yesterday :
  
16. You are doing a survey in a war-torn country to estimate what percentage of unemployed men support the rebels in a civil war. Express this as a ratio estimation problem, where goal is to estimate Y.bar/X.bar.  What are x and y here? Give the estimate and standard error for the percentage of unemployed men who support the rebels.
  
Solution:  x is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man, 0 otherwise.  y is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man and supports the rebels, 0 otherwise.  The estimate is y.bar/x.bar [typo fixed], the standard error is (1/x.bar)*(1/sqrt(n))*s.z, whe</p><p>5 0.12496674 <a title="1441-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-04-How_does_multilevel_modeling_affect_the_estimate_of_the_grand_mean%3F.html">255 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-04-How does multilevel modeling affect the estimate of the grand mean?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay writes:
  
I am convinced of the power of hierarchical modeling and individual parameter pooling concept. I was wondering how could multi-level modeling could influence the estimate of grad mean (NOT individual label).
  
My reply:  Multilevel modeling will affect the estimate of the grand mean in two ways:
 
1.  If the group-level mean is correlated with group size, then the partial pooling will change the estimate of the grand mean (and, indeed, you might want to include group size or some similar variable as a group-level predictor.
 
2.  In any case, the extra error term(s) in a multilevel model will typically affect the standard error of everything, including the estimate of the grand mean.</p><p>6 0.11853317 <a title="1441-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-15-The_bias-variance_tradeoff.html">960 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-15-The bias-variance tradeoff</a></p>

Each student is asked to rate his or her satisfaction (on a 1–10 scale) with his or her experiences. Write the estimate and standard error of the average satisfaction of all the students at the university. Introduce notation as necessary for all the information needed to solve the problem.
 
 Solution to question 17 
 
From  yesterday :
  
17. In a survey of n people, half are asked if they support “the health care law recently passed by Congress” and half are asked if they support “the law known as Obamacare.” The goal is to estimate the effect of the wording on the proportion of Yes responses. How large must n be for the effect to be estimated within a standard error of 5 percentage points?
  
Solution:  se is sqrt(.5*.5/(n/2)+.5*.5/(n/2)) = 1/sqrt(n).  Solve 1/sqrt(n) = .05, you get n = (1/.05)^2 = 400.</p><p>6 0.74519908 <a title="1441-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-13-A_question_about_AIC.html">1377 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-13-A question about AIC</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Radwin writes:
  
I am seeking a statistic measuring an estimate’s reliability or stability as an alternative to the coefficient of variation (CV), also known as the relative standard error. The CV is the standard error of an estimate (proportion, mean, regression coefficient, etc.) divided by the estimate itself, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if a survey finds 15% unemployment with a 6% standard error, the CV is .06/.15 = .4 = 40%.


Some US government agencies flag or suppress as unreliable any estimate with a CV over a certain threshold such as 30% or 50%. But this standard can be arbitrary (for example, 85% employment would have a much lower CV of .06/.85 = 7%), and the CV has other drawbacks I won’t elaborate here. I don’t need an evaluation of the wisdom of using the CV or anything else for measuring an estimate’s stability, but one of my projects calls for such a measure and I would like to find a better alternative.

<p>Introduction: I’ve earlier written that  science is science communication —that is, the act of communicating scientific ideas and findings to ourselves and others is itself a central part of science.  My point was to push against a conventional separation between the act of science and the act of communication, the idea that science is done by scientists and communication is done by communicators.  It’s a rare bit of science that does not include communication as part of it.  As a scientist and science communicator myself, I’m particularly sensitive to devaluing of communication.  (For example, Bayesian Data Analysis is full of original research that was done in order to communicate; or, to put it another way, we often think we understand a scientific idea, but once we try to communicate it, we recognize gaps in our understanding that motivate further research.)
 
I once saw the following on one of those inspirational-sayings-for-every-day desk calendars: “To have ideas is to gather flowers.

<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>4 0.9633714 <a title="1441-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-09-False_memories_and_statistical_analysis.html">2014 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-09-False memories and statistical analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alison George  interviews  Elizabeth Loftus.  It’s good stuff, important stuff, and it relates to my view as a statistician that uncertainty and variation are important.  Uncertainty is relevant here because there are things that people remember that never happened.  Variation is important because different people remember different things.
 
Loftus’s work also seems relevant to the problems with pseudoscience that we’ve been discussing recently on the blog, studies where researchers follow the forms of scientific reasoning and publish in scientific journals, but what they are publishing is essentially unreplicable noise.  Perhaps there’s some connection between all those people Loftus has interviewed, who remember events that never happened to them, and people such as Daryl Bem, who think they’ve computed rigorous p-values even though their analyses seem so clearly to be contingent on the data.  It’s almost like a false memory, that scientists convince themselves that the analysis the</p><p>5 0.96309018 <a title="1441-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-17-Wanted%3A__365_stories_of_statistics.html">1678 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-17-Wanted:  365 stories of statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association has a blog called the Statistics Forum that I edit but haven’t been doing much with.  Originally I thought we’d get a bunch of bloggers and have a topic each week or each month and get discussions from lots of perspectives.  But it was hard to get people to keep contributing, and the blog+comments approach didn’t seem to be working as a way to get wide-ranging discussion.  I did organize a good  roundtable discussion  at one point, but it took a lot of work on my part.
 
Recently I had another idea for the blog, based on something that Kaiser Fung wrote on  three hours in the life of a statistician , along with a similar (if a bit more impressionistic)  piece  I wrote awhile back describing my experiences on a typical workday.
 
So here’s the plan.  365 of you write vignettes about your statistical lives.  Get into the nitty gritty—tell me what you do, and why you’re doing it.  I’ll collect these and then post them at the Statistics Forum, one a day</p><p>6 0.96274889 <a title="1441-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-26-The_reverse-journal-submission_system.html">1393 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-26-The reverse-journal-submission system</a></p>

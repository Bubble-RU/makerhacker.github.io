<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader.

<p>Introduction: David Karger writes:
  
Your  recent post  on sharing data was of great interest to me, as my own research in computer science asks how to incentivize and lower barriers to data sharing.   I was particularly curious about your highlighting of effort as the major dis-incentive to sharing.  I would love to hear more, as this question of effort is on we specifically target in our development of tools for data authoring and publishing.


As a straw man, let me point out that sharing data technically requires no more than posting an excel spreadsheet online.  And that you likely already produced that spreadsheet during your own analytic work.   So, in what way does such low-tech publishing fail to meet your data sharing objectives?


Our own hypothesis has been that the effort is really quite low, with the problem being a lack of *immediate/tangible* benefits (as opposed to the long-term values you accurately describe).

<p>Introduction: This one totally faked me out at first.  It was an email from “Nick Bagnall” that began:
  
Dear Dr. Gelman, 


I made contact last year regarding your work in the CMG: Reconstructing Climate from Tree Ring Data project. We are about to start producing the 2014 edition and I wanted to discuss this with you as we still remain keen to feature your work. 


Research Media are producing a special publication in February of 2014, within this report we will be working with a small selected number of PI’s with a focus on geosciences, atmospheric and geospace sciences and earth Sciences.. 
  
At this point, I’m thinking:  Hmmm, I don’t remember this guy, is this some sort of collaborative project that I’d forgotten about?
 
The message then continues:
  
The publication is called International Innovation . . .
  
Huh?  This doesn’t sound so good.  The email then goes on with some very long lists, and then finally the kicker:
  
The total cost for each article produced in this report is fixed a</p><p>5 0.67617023 <a title="1238-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-02-7_ways_to_separate_errors_from_statistics.html">1835 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-02-7 ways to separate errors from statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers have been inspired by the recent Reinhardt and Rogoff  debacle  to  list  “six ways to separate lies from statistics” in economics research:
  
1. “Focus on how robust a finding is, meaning that different ways of looking at the evidence point to the same conclusion.”


2.  Don’t confuse statistical with practical significance.


3.  “Be wary of scholars using high-powered statistical techniques as a bludgeon to silence critics who are not specialists.”


4.  “Don’t fall into the trap of thinking about an empirical finding as ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ At best, data provide an imperfect guide.”


5.  “Don’t mistake correlation for causation.”


6.  “Always ask ‘so what?’”
  
I like all these points, especially #4, which I think doesn’t get said enough.  As I  wrote  a few months ago, high-profile social science research aims for proof, not for understanding—and that’s a problem.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)

<p>Introduction: How am I supposed to handle this sort of thing?  (See below.)  I just stuck it one of my email folders without responding, but then I wondered . . . what’s it all about?  Is there some sort of Glengarry Glen Ross-like parallel world where down-on-their-luck Jack Lemmons of public relations world send out electronic cold calls?  More than anything else, this sort of thing makes me glad I have a steady job.
 
Here’s the (unsolicited) email, which came with the subject line “Please help a reporter do his job”:

<p>Introduction: In a discussion of his variant of the write-a-thousand-words-a-day strategy (as he puts it, “a system for the production of academic results in writing”), Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
Believe the claims you are making. That is, confine yourself to making claims you believe. I always emphasize this when I [Basbøll] define knowledge as “justified, true belief”. . . . I think if there is one sure way to undermine your sense of your own genius it is to begin to say things you know to be publishable without being sure they are true. Or even things you know to be “true” but don’t understand well enough to believe.
  
He points out that this is not so easy:
  
In times when there are strong orthodoxies it can sometimes be difficult to know what to believe. Or, rather, it is all too easy to know what to believe (what the “right belief” is).

<p>Introduction: Basbøll  writes :
  
I [Basbøll] have got to come up with forty things to say [in the next few months]. . . .


What would you like me to write about?  I’ll of course be writing quite a bit about what I’m now calling “article design”, i.e., how to map out the roughly forty paragraphs that a journal article is composed of. And I’ll also be talking about how to plan the writing process that is to produce those paragraphs. The basic principle is still to write at least one paragraph a day in 27 minutes. (You can adapt this is various ways to your own taste; some like 18-minute or even 13-minute paragraphs.)


But I’d like to talk about questions of style, too, and even a little bit about epistemology. “Knowledge—academic knowledge, that is—is the ability to compose a coherent prose paragraph about something in 27 minutes,” I always say. I’d like to reflect a little more about what this conception of knowledge really means.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
[Advertising executive] Russell Davies wrote a  blog post  called “The Tyranny of the Big Idea”. His five-point procedure begins:

 
Start doing stuff. Start executing things which seem right. Do it quickly and do it often. Don’t cling onto anything, good or bad. Don’t repeat much. Take what was good and do it differently.
 

And ends with: “And something else and something else.”
  
This inspires several thoughts, which I’ll take advantage of the blog format to present with no attempt to be cohesively organized.
 
1.  My first concern is the extent to which productivity-enhancing advice such as Davies’s (and Basbøll’s) is zero or even  negative-sum , just helping people in the rat race.  But, upon reflection, I’d rate the recommendations as positive-sum.  If people learn to write better and be more productive, that’s not (necessarily) just positional.
 
2.  Blogging fits with the “Do it quickly and do it often” advice.

<p>Introduction: Basbøll :
  
My aim is Socratic. I don’t want to help you become more knowledgeable. I want to help you better distinguish what you know from what you don’t know.
  
Excellent point.  Indeed, laying out what I do know and tracing the boundary of my ignorance, that’s what writing is all about for me.</p><p>2 0.87046254 <a title="1602-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-07-Biostatistics_via_Pragmatic_and_Perceptive_Bayes..html">453 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-07-Biostatistics via Pragmatic and Perceptive Bayes.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This conference touches nicely on many of the more Biostatistics related topics that have come up on this blog from a pragmatic and perceptive Bayesian perspective.
 
 Fourth Annual Bayesian Biostatistics Conference 
 
Including the star of that recent Cochrane TV debate who will be the key note speaker. 
 
See here  Subtle statistical issues to be debated on TV.  and perhaps the last comment which is my personal take on that debate.

<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>4 0.82131898 <a title="1602-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-26-I_need_a_title_for_my_book_on_ethics_and_statistics%21%21.html">1590 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-26-I need a title for my book on ethics and statistics!!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Ethics and Statistics” is descriptive but boring.  It sounds like the textbook for a course which, unfortunately, nobody will take.
 
“Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics” is too unoriginal.
 
“How to Lie, Cheat, and Steal With Statistics” is kind of ok, maybe?
 
“Statistical Dilemmas”:  maybe a bit too boring as well.
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Statistics, and Some Guys Who’ve Skated a Bit Close to the Edge”:  Hmmm….
 
Maybe we have to get “statistics” out of the title altogether?
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Data Science”?
 
“Date Science and Data Fraud”?
 
“10 Things You Really Really Really Shouldn’t Do With Numbers”?
 
And, if no better idea comes along, there’s always “Evilicious:  Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad.”  (Regular readers will know what I’m talking about here; the rest of you can google it.)
 
Or maybe just “The Wegman Report”?
 
It’s  hard  to come up with a good title. Even  John Updike  had difficulties in this regard.
 
If any of you can suggest a better title for my eth</p><p>5 0.81920075 <a title="1602-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-Estimating_seasonality_with_a_data_set_that%E2%80%99s_just_52_weeks_long.html">1513 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-Estimating seasonality with a data set that’s just 52 weeks long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>6 0.8115083 <a title="1602-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>

Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>Introduction: Marty McKee at Wolfram Research appears to have a very very stupid colleague.  McKee  wrote  to Christian Robert:
  
Your article, “Evidence and Evolution: A review”, caught the attention of one of my colleagues, who thought that it could be developed into an interesting Demonstration to add to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.
  
As Christian points out, adapting his book review into a computer demonstration would be quite a feat!  I wonder what McKee’s colleague could be thinking?  I recommend that Wolfram fire McKee’s colleague immediately:  what an idiot!
 
P.S.  I’m not actually sure that McKee was the author of this email; I’m guessing this was the case because this other  very similar  email was written under his name.
 
P.P.S.  To head off the inevitable comments:  Yes, yes, I know this is no big deal and I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it.  But . . .

<p>Introduction: There was this thing going around awhile ago, the “porn star name,” which you create by taking the name of your childhood pet, followed by the name of the street where you grew up (for example, Blitz Clifton).
 
But recently I’ve been thinking about spam names.  Just in the last two days, I’ve received emails from “Blair Williams” (“I’m sorry to have to tell you this.

Actually, I think “Nick Bagnall” is probably a real person who’s just spamming me.  But the first three names above look fake fake fake.

The new Wolfram Statistics Course Assistant App, which was released today for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Optimized for mobile devices, the Wolfram Statistics Course Assistant App helps students understand concepts such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, probabilities, data points, random integers, random real numbers, and more.


To see some examples of how you and your readers can use the app, I’d like to encourage you to check out  this post  on the Wolfram|Alpha Blog.
  
If anybody out there with an i-phone etc. wants to try this out, please let me know how it works.  I’m always looking for statistics-learning tools for students.  I’m not really happy with the whole “mean, median, mode” thing (see above), but if the app has good things, then an instructor could pick and choose what to recommend, I assume.

And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized.

I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.


Sincerely,

We’re looking for writers that can help increase the profile of our clients by linking to them within the context of their articles. The clients are huge, and we generally have one that can fit naturally in the context of most article niches. 
In return, we pay generously for a single link for our clients. 
If you are interested, I’d love to talk about it more.


Regards, 
Bryan Clark

<p>Introduction: I received the following two emails within fifteen minutes of each other.
 
First, from “Alexa Russell,” subject line “An idea for a blog post: The Role, Importance, and Power of Words”:
  
Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best, 
Alexa

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there.  As I  wrote  a couple years ago, it’s usually presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
For example, Nassim Taleb has a  webpage  that includes a bunch of one-line bits of advice (scroll to item 132 on the linked page).  Here’s his final piece of advice:
  
If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.
  
I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.  I’ve been in environments where people follow Taleb’s advice, saying nothing and occasionally trying to “eliminate” people, and it’s not pretty.  I much prefer for people to be open</p><p>3 0.94684625 <a title="1421-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic_screening_to_get_an_approximate_self-weighted_sample.html">1455 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic screening to get an approximate self-weighted sample</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharad had a survey sampling question:
  
We’re trying to use mechanical turk to conduct some surveys, and have quickly discovered that turkers tend to be quite young. We’d really like a representative sample of the U.S., or at the least be able to recruit a diverse enough sample from turk that we can post-stratify to adjust the estimates. The approach we ended up taking is to pay turkers a small amount to answer a couple of screening questions (age & sex), and then probabilistically recruit individuals to complete the full survey (for more money) based on the estimated turk population parameters and our desired target distribution. We use rejection sampling, so the end result is that individuals who are invited to take the full survey look as if they came from a representative sample, at least in terms of age and sex. I’m wondering whether this sort of technique—a two step design in which participants are first screened and then probabilistically selected to mimic a target distributio</p><p>4 0.9460367 <a title="1421-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-10-The_last_great_essayist%3F.html">197 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-10-The last great essayist?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>5 0.94547415 <a title="1421-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-27-Bayesian_model_averaging_or_fitting_a_larger_model.html">1999 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-27-Bayesian model averaging or fitting a larger model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Firoozye writes:
  
I had a question about BMA [Bayesian model averaging] and model combinations in general, and direct it to you since they are a basic form of hierarchical model, albeit in the simplest of forms. I wanted to ask what the underlying assumptions are that could lead to BMA improving on a larger model. 


I know model combination is a topic of interest in the (frequentist) econometrics community (e.g., Bates & Granger, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3008764?uid=3738032&uid;=2&uid;=4&sid;=21101948653381) but at the time it was considered a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps small models combined outperform a big model due to standard errors, insufficient data, etc. But I haven’t seen much in way of Bayesian justification.


In simplest terms, you might have a joint density P(Y,theta_1,theta_2) from which you could use the two marginals P(Y,theta_1) and P(Y,theta_2) to derive two separate forecasts. A BMA-er would do a weighted average of the two forecast densities, having p</p><p>6 0.94509959 <a title="1421-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-03-An_argument_that_can%E2%80%99t_possibly_make_sense.html">743 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-03-An argument that can’t possibly make sense</a></p>

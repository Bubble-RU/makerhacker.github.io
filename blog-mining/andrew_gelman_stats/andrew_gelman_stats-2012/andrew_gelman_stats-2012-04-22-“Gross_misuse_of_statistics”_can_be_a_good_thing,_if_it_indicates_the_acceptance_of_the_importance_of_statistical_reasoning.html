<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:
  
Participants in the Health Prize challenge will be given a data set comprised of the de-identified medical records of 100,000 individuals who are members of HPN.

The winners will receive the $3 million prize. . . . the contest is designed to spur involvement by others involved in analytics, such as those involved in data mining and predictive modeling who may not currently be working in health care.  “We believe that doing so will bring innovative thinking to health analytics and may allow us to solve at</p><p>5 0.10252052 <a title="1276-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-04-%E2%80%9CTitanic_Thompson%3A__The_Man_Who_Would_Bet_on_Everything%E2%80%9D.html">1405 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-04-“Titanic Thompson:  The Man Who Would Bet on Everything”</a></p>

Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.
 
The question then arises:  why do descriptions of data science focus so</p><p>5 0.78232545 <a title="1276-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-24-An_interesting_mosaic_of_a_data_programming_course.html">2345 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-24-An interesting mosaic of a data programming course</a></p>

I have been working on a website, SlideRule that in its present state, is a catalog of online courses aggregated from over 35 providers. One of the products we are building on top of this is something called Learning Paths, which are essentially a sequence of Online Courses designed to help learners gain mastery over a certain subject.


We have recently released a Learning Path on  Data Analysis , contributed by Claudia Gold, an early data scientist at Airbnb. We’d love it if you could look at it and tell us what you think. We are always looking for constructive feedback.

<p>Introduction: Since we’re  talking  about the scaled inverse Wishart . . . here’s a recent message from Chris Chatham:
 
I have been reading your book on Bayesian Hierarchical/Multilevel Modeling but have been struggling a bit with deciding whether to model my multivariate normal distribution using the scaled inverse Wishart approach you advocate given the arguments at  this blog post  [entitled "Why an inverse-Wishart prior may not be such a good idea"].
 
My reply:  We discuss this in our book.  We know the inverse-Wishart has problems, that’s why we recommend the  scaled  inverse-Wishart, which is a more general class of models.   Here ‘s an old blog post on the topic.  And also of course there’s the description in our book.
 
Chris pointed me to the following  comment  by Simon Barthelmé:
  
Using the scaled inverse Wishart doesn’t change anything, the standard deviations of the invidual coefficients and their covariance are still dependent. My answer would be to use a prior that models the stan</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96169555 <a title="1276-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-%E2%80%9CGross_misuse_of_statistics%E2%80%9D_can_be_a_good_thing%2C_if_it_indicates_the_acceptance_of_the_importance_of_statistical_reasoning.html">1276 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-“Gross misuse of statistics” can be a good thing, if it indicates the acceptance of the importance of statistical reasoning</a></p>

I [Lightburn] am also a member of the group Business  Analytics  on LinkedIn.  I am struck by what I perceive as the gross misuse of statistics by the members of this group, including things that (I thought) were taught in Introductory Statistics courses in business schools.  I want to suggest to you that you look at the discussions there if you want examples of such abuse.


The discussions there support me in my belief that Analytics is data manipulation in the support of previously developed conclusions.
  
My reply:  I don’t think it’s such a bad thing.  I like when people make statistical arguments, even bad statistical arguments.  Once you accept the concept of arguing from logic and data, maybe you’ll be open to learning something new</p><p>3 0.95864463 <a title="1276-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-10-My_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1311 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-10-My final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We had 28 class periods, so I wrote an exam with an approximate correspondence of one question per class.  Rather than dumping the exam in your lap all at once, I’ll post the questions once per day.  Then each day I’ll post the answer to yesterday’s questions.  So it will be 29 days in all.  I’ll post them to appear late in the day so as not to interfere with our main daily posts (which are currently backed up to early June).
 
The course was offered in the political science department and covered a mix of statistical and political topics.  Followers of our  recent discussion  on test questions won’t be surprised to learn that some of the questions are ambiguous.  This wasn’t on purpose.  I tried my best, but good questions are hard to write.
 
Question 1 will appear tomorrow.</p><p>4 0.95848835 <a title="1276-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-18-Standardizing_regression_inputs.html">1462 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-18-Standardizing regression inputs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andy Flies, Ph.D. candidate in zoology, writes:
  
After reading your paper about scaling regression inputs by two standard deviations I found your  blog post  stating that you wished you had scaled by 1 sd and coded the binary inputs as -1 and 1.  Here is my question:


If you code the binary input as -1 and 1, do you then standardize it?  This makes sense to me because the mean of the standardized input is then zero and the sd is 1, which is what the mean and sd are for all of the other standardized inputs.  I know that if you code the binary input as 0 and 1 it should not be standardized.


Also, I am not interested in the actual units (i.e. mg/ml) of my response variable and I would like to compare a couple of different response variables that are on different scales.  Would it make sense to standardize the response variable also?
  
My reply:  No, I donâ&euro;&trade;t standardize the binary input.  The point of standardizing inputs is to make the coefs directly interpretable, but with binary i</p><p>5 0.9584468 <a title="1276-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-21-Belief_in_hell_is_associated_with_lower_crime_rates.html">1386 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-21-Belief in hell is associated with lower crime rates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):

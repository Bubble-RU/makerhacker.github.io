<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?

<p>Introduction: I just gave my first Skype presentation today, and it felt pretty strange.
 
The technical difficulties mostly arose with the sound.  There were heavy echoes and so we ended up just cutting off the sound from the audience.  This made it more difficult for me because I couldn’t gauge audience reaction.  It was a real challenge to give a talk without being able to hear the laughter of the audience.  (I asked them to wave their hands every time they laughed, but they didn’t do so–or else they were never laughing, which would be even worse.)
 
Next time I’ll use the telephone for at least one of the sound channels.
 
The visuals were ok from my side–I just went thru my slides one by one, using the cursor to point to things.  I prefer standing next to the screen and pointing with my hands.  But doing it this way was ok, considering.
 
The real visual problem went the other way:  I couldn’t really see the audience.  From the perspective of the little computer camera, everyone seemed far away</p><p>4 0.21032424 <a title="1143-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-18-G%2B_hangout_for_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_course_now%21_%28actually%2C_in_5_minutes%29.html">2068 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-18-G+ hangout for Bayesian Data Analysis course now!

<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?  Thanks.</p><p>5 0.18961769 <a title="1143-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-What_goes_around_._._..html">548 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-What goes around . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.
 
It would take very little effort to adapt this graph-laden a</p><p>5 0.8362093 <a title="1143-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-20-Not_quite_getting_the_point.html">1073 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-20-Not quite getting the point</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I gave  this talk  the other day and afterwards, a white guy came up to me and said he thought it was no coincidence that the researcher who made the mistake was “Oriental.”  He then went on for about 5 minutes explaining his theory.  I couldn’t keep myself from laughing—I had to start coughing into a napkin to hide it.</p><p>6 0.82612884 <a title="1143-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-09-%EF%BF%BCLittle_Data%3A_How_traditional_statistical_ideas_remain_relevant_in_a_big-data_world.html">1526 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-09-￼Little Data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big-data world</a></p>

Media, web design, and marketing have all created an environment where stakeholders – clients, program participants, funders – all expect high quality graphics and reporting that effectively conveys the valuable insights from evaluation work. Some in statistics and mathematics have used data visualization strategies to support more useful reporting of complex ideas. Global growing interest in improving communications has begun to take root in the evaluation field as well. But as anyone who has sat through a day’s worth of a conference or had to endure a dissertation-worthy evaluation report knows, evaluators still have a long way to go. To support the development of researchers and evaluators, some members of the American Evaluation Association are proposing a new TIG (Topical Interest Group) on Data Visualization and Reporting.  If you are a member of AEA (or want to be) and you are interested in joining this TIG,  contact  Stephanie Evergreen.</p><p>2 0.97226453 <a title="1143-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>4 0.96202564 <a title="1143-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t_think_of_it_as_duplication._Think_of_it_as_a_single_paper_in_a_superposition_of_two_quantum_journals.%E2%80%9D.html">1654 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-“Don’t think of it as duplication.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>5 0.95737481 <a title="1143-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-27-%E2%80%9CHow_to_Lie_with_Statistics%E2%80%9D_guy_worked_for_the_tobacco_industry_to_mock_studies_of_the_risks_of_smoking_statistics.html">1285 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-27-“How to Lie with Statistics” guy worked for the tobacco industry to mock studies of the risks of smoking statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>6 0.95071512 <a title="1143-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-10-Presenting_at_the_econ_seminar.html">1050 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-10-Presenting at the econ seminar</a></p>

I [Karl] personally would avoid sports entirely, as I view the subject to be insufficiently serious. . . . Certainly lots of statisticians are interested in sports. . . . And I’m not completely uninterested in sports: I like to watch football, particularly Nebraska, Green Bay, and Baltimore, and to see Notre Dame or any team from Florida or Texas lose.


But statistics about sports? Yawn.
  
As a person who loves sports, statistics, and sports statistics, I have a few thoughts:
 
1.  Not everyone likes sports, and even fewer are interested in any particular sport.  It’s ok to use sports examples, but don’t delude yourself into thinking that everyone in the class cares about it.
 
2.  Don’t forget foreign students.  A lot of them don’t even know the rules of kickball, fer chrissake!
 
3.  Of the students who care about a sport, there will be a minority who  really  care.  We had some serious basketball fans in our class last year.

<p>Introduction: Hey, we all know the answer:  “correlation does not imply causation”—but of course life is more complicated than that.  As philosophers, economists, statisticians, and others have repeatedly noted, most of our information about the world is observational not experimental, yet we manage to draw causal conclusions all the time.  Sure, some of these conclusions are wrong (more often than 5% of the time, I’m sure) but that’s an accepted part of life.
 
Challenges in this regard arise in the design of a study, in the statistical analysis, in how you write it up for a peer-reviewed journal, and finally in how you present it to the world.
 
 School sports and life outcomes 
 
An interesting case of all this came up recently in a post on  Freakonomics  that pointed to a post on  Deadspin  that pointed to a  research article .  The claim was that “sports participation [in high school] causes women to be less likely to be religious . . . more likely to have children . . . more likely to be singl</p><p>5 0.12712954 <a title="1215-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-17-Weak_identification_provides_partial_information.html">1903 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-17-Weak identification provides partial information</a></p>

My question is about Bayesian analysis of the linear regression model. It seems to me that in some cases this approach throws out useful information.


As an example, imagine you have two basketball players randomly drawn from the pool of NBA players (which provides the prior). You’d like to estimate how many free throws each can make out of 100. You have two pieces of information:


- Session 1: Each player shoots 100 shots, and you learn player A’s total minus player B’s total


- Session 2: Player A does another session where he shoots 100 shots alone, and you learn his total


If we take the regression approach:


y_i = number of shots made 
beta_A = player A’s expected number out of 100 
beta_B = player B’s expected number out of 100 
x_i = vector of zeros and ones showing which player took shots


In the above example, our datapoints are:


y_1 (first number reported) = beta_A * 1 + beta_B * (-1) + epsilon_1 
y_2 (second number reported) = beta_A * 1 +</p><p>6 0.087945364 <a title="1215-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-08-The_China_Study%3A__fact_or_fallacy%3F.html">263 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-08-The China Study:  fact or fallacy?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From a recent email exchange:
 
I agree that you should never compare p-values directly.  The p-value is a strange nonlinear transformation of data that is only interpretable under the null hypothesis. Once you abandon the null (as we do when we observe something with a very low p-value), the p-value itself becomes irrelevant.  To put it another way, the p-value is a measure of evidence, it is not an estimate of effect size (as it is often treated, with the idea that a p=.001 effect is larger than a p=.01 effect, etc).  Even conditional on sample size, the p-value is not a measure of effect size.</p><p>4 0.71330428 <a title="1215-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-21-Scrabble%21.html">813 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-21-Scrabble!</a></p>

Sitting on my [AT's] to-do list for a while now has been an exploration of Scrabble from an experimental design point of view; how to better design a tournament to make the variance as small as possible while still preserving the appearance of the home game to its players. . . . 


I’m proud (relieved?) to say that I’ve finally  finished the first draft  of this work for two-player head-to-head games, with a duplication method that ensures that if the game were repeated, each player would receive tiles from the reserve in the same sequence: think of the tiles being laid out in order (but unseen to the players), so that one player draws from the front and the other draws from the back. . . .


One goal of this was to figure out how much of the variance in score comes from the tile order and how much comes from the board, given that a tile order would be expected. It turns out to be about half-bag, half-board . . .

In the past few years, the empirical foundations of the social sciences, especially Psychology, have been coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. For example, there was the New Yorker piece from 2010 called “The Truth Wears Off” about the “decline effect,” or how the effect size of a phenomenon appears to decrease over time. . . .


I [Fruehwald] am a linguist. Do the problems facing psychology face me? To really answer that, I first have to decide which explanation for the decline effect I think is most likely, and I think Andrew Gelman’s proposal is a good candidate:

 
The short story is that if you screen for statistical significance when estimating small effects, you will necessarily overestimate the magnitudes of effects, sometimes by a huge amount.

<p>Introduction: Phil pointed me to  this paper  so I thought I probably better repeat what I  wrote  a couple years ago:
 
1. The effects are certainly not zero. We are not machines, and anything that can affect our expectations (for example, our success in previous tries) should affect our performance.
 
2. The effects I’ve seen are small, on the order of 2 percentage points (for example, the probability of a success in some sports task might be 45% if you’re “hot” and 43% otherwise).
 
3. There’s a huge amount of variation, not just between but also among players. Sometimes if you succeed you will stay relaxed and focused, other times you can succeed and get overconfidence.
 
4. Whatever the latest results on particular sports, I can’t see anyone overturning the basic finding of Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky that players and spectators alike will perceive the hot hand even when it does not exist and dramatically overestimate the magnitude and consistency of any hot-hand phenomenon that does exist.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92295146 <a title="1215-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-16-The_%E2%80%9Chot_hand%E2%80%9D_and_problems_with_hypothesis_testing.html">1215 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-16-The “hot hand” and problems with hypothesis testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: Since weâ&euro;&trade;ve been  discussing  prior distributions on covariance matrices, I will recommend  this recent article  (coauthored with Tomoki Tokuda, Ben Goodrich, Iven Van Mechelen, and Francis Tuerlinckx) on their visualization:
  
We present some methods for graphing distributions of covariance matrices and demonstrate them on several models, including the Wishart, inverse-Wishart, and scaled inverse-Wishart families in different dimensions. Our visualizations follow the principle of decomposing a covariance matrix into scale parameters and correlations, pulling out marginal summaries where possible and using two and three-dimensional plots to reveal multivariate structure. Visualizing a distribution of covariance matrices is a step beyond visualizing a single covariance matrix or a single multivariate dataset. Our visualization methods are available through the R package VisCov.</p><p>5 0.90117538 <a title="1215-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-24-Recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">1953 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-24-Recently in the sister blog</a></p>

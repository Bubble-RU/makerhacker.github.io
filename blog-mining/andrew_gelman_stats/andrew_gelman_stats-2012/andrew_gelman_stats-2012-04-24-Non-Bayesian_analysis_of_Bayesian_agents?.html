<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  thoughts  from Kaiser Fung.
 
Derman seems to have a point in his criticisms of economic models—and things are just as bad in other social sciences.  (I’ve  criticized  economists and political scientists for taking a crude, 80-year-old model of psychology as “foundational,” but even more sophisticated models in psychology and sociology have a lot of holes, if you go outside of certain clearly bounded areas such as psychometrics.)
 
What can be done, then?  One approach, which appeals to me as a statistician, is to more carefully define one’s range of inquiry.  Even if we don’t have a great model of political bargaining, we can still use ideal-point models to capture a lot of the variation in legislative voting.  And, in my blog post linked to above, I recommended that economists forget about coming up with the grand unified theory of human behavior (pretty impossible, given that they still don’t want to let go of much of their folk-psychology models) and put more effort i</p><p>4 0.15980452 <a title="1280-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-25-Ways_of_knowing.html">1469 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-25-Ways of knowing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Psychology researcher Alison Gopnik  discusses  the idea that some of the systematic problems with human reasoning can be explained by systematic flaws in the statistical models we implicitly use.
 
I really like this idea and I’ll return to it in a bit.  But first I need to discuss a minor (but, I think, ultimately crucial) disagreement I have with how Gopnik describes Bayesian inference.  She writes:
  
The Bayesian idea is simple, but it turns out to be very powerful. It’s so powerful, in fact, that computer scientists are using it to design intelligent learning machines, and more and more psychologists think that it might explain human intelligence. Bayesian inference is a way to use statistical data to evaluate hypotheses and make predictions. These might be scientific hypotheses and predictions or everyday ones.
  
So far, so good.  Next comes the problem (as I see it).  Gopnik writes:

<p>Introduction: Nowadays “Bayesian” is often taken to be a synonym for rationality, and I can see how this can irritate thoughtful philosophers and statisticians alike: To start with, lots of rational thinking—even lots of rational statistical inference—does not occur within the Bayesian formalism. And, to look at it from the other direction, lots of self-proclaimed Bayesian inference hardly seems rational at all.  And in what way is “subjective probability” a model for rational scientific inquiry? On the contrary, subjectivity and rationality are in many ways opposites!  [emphasis added]


The goal of this paper is to break the link between Bayesian modeling (good, in my opinion) and subjectivity (bad). From this perspective, the irritation of falsificationists regarding exaggerated claims of Bayesian rationality are my ally. . . .

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi writes the above in a  discussion  of a misunderstanding of the economics of Keynes.
 
The discussion is interesting.  According to Sethi, Keynes wrote that, in a depression, nominal wages might be sticky but in any case a decline in wages would not do the trick to increase hiring.  But many modern economics writers have missed this. For example, Gary Becker writes, “Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in the downward direction. . . . A fall in price stimulates demand and reduces supply until they are brought back to rough equality.”  Whether Becker is empirically correct is another story, but in any case he is misinterpreting Keynes.
 
But the actual reason I’m posting here is in reaction to Sethi’s remark quoted in the title above, in which he endorses a 1975 paper by James Tobin on wages and employment but remarks that Tobin’s paper did not include the individual-level de</p><p>2 0.96365178 <a title="1280-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-31-Statistical_modeling%2C_causal_inference%2C_and_social_science.html">1645 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-31-Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  discussion  by Berk Ozler (which I found following  links  from Tyler Cowen) of a study by Erwin Bulte, Lei Pan, Joseph Hella, Gonne Beekman, and Salvatore di Falco that compares two agricultural experiments, one blinded and one unblinded.  Bulte et al. find much different results in the two experiments and attribute the difference to expectation effects (when people know they’re receiving an experiment they behave differently); Ozler is skeptical and attributes the different outcomes to various practical differences in implementation of the two experiments.
 
I’m reminded somehow of the  notorious  sham experiment on the dead chickens, a story that was good for endless discussion in my Bayesian statistics class last semester.  I think we can all agree that dead chickens won’t exhibit a placebo effect.  Live farmers, though, that’s another story.
 
I don’t have any stake in this particular fight, but on quick reading I’m sympathetic to Ozler’s argument that this all is wel</p><p>3 0.96332431 <a title="1280-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Ethical_and_data-integrity_problems_in_a_study_of_mortality_in_Iraq.html">5 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Ethical and data-integrity problems in a study of mortality in Iraq</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design. The paper also presents some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories. This evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or</p><p>same-blog 4 0.95847577 <a title="1280-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-24-Non-Bayesian_analysis_of_Bayesian_agents%3F.html">1280 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-24-Non-Bayesian analysis of Bayesian agents?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Econometrician and statistician Dale Poirier writes:
  
24 years ago (1988, Journal of Economics Perspectives) I [Poirier] noted cognitive dissonance among some economists who treat the agents in their theoretical framework as Bayesians, but then analyze the data (even in the same paper!) as a frequentist. Recently, I have found similar cases in cognitive science. I suspect other disciplines exhibit such behavior. Do you know of any examples in political science?
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know of any such examples in political science.  Game theoretic models are popular in poli sci, but I haven’t seen much in the way of models of Bayesian decision making.
 
Here are two references (not in political science) that might be helpful.
 
1.  I have  argued  that the utility model (popular in economics and political science as a way of providing “microfoundations” for analyses of aggregate behavior) is actually more of a bit of folk-psychology that should not be taken seriously.  To me, it is si</p><p>5 0.94200647 <a title="1280-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-21-Roller_coasters%2C_charity%2C_profit%2C_hmmm.html">157 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-21-Roller coasters, charity, profit, hmmm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes:
  
 Here  is a very interesting article form Science that reports result of experiment that looked at whether people bought a product (picture of themselves screaming or vomiting on roller coaster) or paid more for it when told “1/2 to charity.” Answer was “buy more” but “pay lots 
less” than when alternative was fixed price w/ or w/o charity; and “buy more”  & “pay more” if consumer could name own price & 1/2 went to charity than if none went to charity. Pretty interesting.
  
But . . .
  
 
What’s odd, I [Kahan] think, is the measure used to report the result. The paper (written by some really amazingly good social psychologists; I know this from other studies) goes on & on, w/ figures & tables, about how the amusement park’s “revenue,” “revenue per ride” & “profit” went up by large amount when it used “name your own price & 1/2 to charity.” Yet that result is dominated by random effects — the marginal cost & volume of sales are peculiar to the product being sold &</p><p>6 0.93857813 <a title="1280-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-02-Microfoundations_of_macroeconomics.html">2195 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-02-Microfoundations of macroeconomics</a></p>

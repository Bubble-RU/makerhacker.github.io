<p>Introduction: This  was just bizarre.  It’s an interview with Colin Camerer, a professor of finance and economics at Caltech, The topic is Camerer’s marriage, but what’s weird is that he doesn’t say anything specific about his wife at all.

Also some schoolyard evolutionary biology (“men signaling that they will help you raise your baby after conception, and women signaling fidelity” blah blah blah) and advice for husbands in “upper-class marriages with assets.”  (No advice to the wives, but maybe that’s a good thing.)

<p>Introduction: I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc., or see here for a  more technical paper  with Kari Lock) but had a few things to add in light of Sam Wang’s  recent efforts . As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.  I</p><p>4 0.11074402 <a title="1578-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-12-Benford%E2%80%99s_Law_suggests_lots_of_financial_fraud.html">954 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-12-Benford’s Law suggests lots of financial fraud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I love  this post by Jialan Wang.  Wang “downloaded quarterly accounting data for all firms in Compustat, the most widely-used dataset in corporate finance that contains data on over 20,000 firms from SEC filings” and looked at the statistical distribution of leading digits in various pieces of financial information. As expected, the distribution is very close to what is predicted by  Benford’s Law .
 
Very close, but not identical. But does that mean anything? Benford’s “Law” isn’t really a law, it’s more of a rule or principle: it’s certainly possible for the distribution of leading digits in financial data — even a massive corpus of it — to deviate from the rule without this indicating massive fraud or error. But, aha, Wang also looks at how the deviation from Benford’s Law has changed with time, and looks at it by industry, and this is where things get really interesting and suggestive. I really can’t summarize any better than Wang did, so click on the first</p><p>5 0.096493542 <a title="1578-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-02-Interaction-based_feature_selection_and_classification_for_high-dimensional_biological_data.html">1703 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-02-Interaction-based feature selection and classification for high-dimensional biological data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Esteban writes:
  
In your blog your advice for performing regression  in the presence of large numbers of correlated features, has been to use composite scores and hierarchical modeling. Unfortunately, many problems don’t provide an obvious and unambiguous way of grouping features together (e.g. gene expression data). Are there any techniques that you would recommend that automatically pool correlated features together based on the data, without requiring the researcher to manually define composite scores or feature hierarchies?
  
I don’t know the answer to this but I imagine something is possible . . . any ideas? 
   
In the meantime I’m reminded of  this recent article  by Shaw-Hwa Lo, Haitian Wang, Tian Zheng, and Inchi Hu:

<p>Introduction: In response to my most recent  post  expressing bafflement over the Erving Goffman mystique, several commenters helped out by suggesting classic Goffman articles for me to read.  Naturally, I followed the  reference  that had a link attached–it was for an article called Cooling the Mark Out, which analogized the frustrations of laid-off and set-aside white-collar workers to the reactions to suckers after being bilked by con artists.
 
Goffman’s article was fascinating, but I was bothered by a tone of smugness. Here’s a quote from Cooling the Mark Out that starts on the cute side but is basically ok:
  
In organizations patterned after a bureaucratic model, it is customary for personnel to expect rewards of a specified kind upon fulfilling requirements of a specified nature. Personnel come to define their career line in terms of a sequence of legitimate expectations and to base their self-conceptions on the assumption that in due course they will be what the institution allows persons t</p><p>4 0.74415058 <a title="1578-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-26-Politics_as_an_escape_hatch.html">1591 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-26-Politics as an escape hatch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reading  these  news articles that slam more and more nails into the (perhaps unfairly) already-dead reputation of Hewlett Packard executive Meg Whitman, I keep thinking:  what if she’d won her election a couple years ago and was now governor or senator or whatever she was running for?  Then nobody would care that her company was falling apart!
 
Conversely, when Jon Corzine lost his reelection and reentered the business world, he left himself open to charges of acts of corruption that wouldn’t have been possible in congress or from the governor’s office.
 
But sometimes the immunity can go the other way.  Jack Welch still has the street-cred to  write  Wall Street Journal editorials despite his  history  of data manipulation, but it’s hard to imagine he could be elected to public office, even if he wanted to.  For another example, Al Sharpton was caught out on his lies in a well-publicized court case but that does not stop him from being bankrolled as a quasi-public figure.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Anthony  tells the excellent story  of how Nick Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman shot down some particularly silly work in psychology.  (“According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.”  And, yes, the work they were shooting down really is that bad.)
 
If you want to see what the fuss is about, just google “2.9013.”   Here’s  an example (from 2012) of an uncritical reporting of the claim,  here’s  another one from 2010,  here’s  one from 2011 . . . well, you get the idea.
 
And  here’s a quick summary  posted by Rolf Zwaan after Brown et al. came out with their paper.
 
I know Sokal and Brown and so this story was not news to me.  I didn’t post anything about it on this blog because it seemed like it was getting enough coverage elsewhere.

<p>Introduction: Someone who works in statistics in the pharmaceutical industry (but prefers to remain anonymous) sent me  this update  to our discussion on the differences between approvals of drugs and medical devices:
  
The ‘substantial equivalence’ threshold is a very outdated. Basically the FDA has to follow federal law and the law is antiquated and leads to two extraordinarily different paths for device approval.


You could have a very simple but first-in-kind device with an easy to understand physiological mechanism of action (e.g. the FDA approved a simple tiny stent that would relieve pressure from a glaucoma patient’s eye this summer).  This device would require a standard (likely controlled) trial at the one-sided 0.025 level. Even after the trial it would likely go to a panel where outside experts (e.g.practicing & academic MDs and statisticians) hear evidence from the company and FDA and vote on its safety and efficacy.  FDA would then rule, consider the panel’s vote, on whether to appro</p><p>2 0.92547655 <a title="1578-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-To_commenters_who_are_trying_to_sell_something.html">839 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-To commenters who are trying to sell something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.
 
I’m reminded of a bizarrely-retro  remark  from a couple years ago by Colin (“at age 22″) Camerer.  In response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer said:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”
 
What’s with these guys?  My guess is that their social circle has a bit of a country-club locker-room feel, and they find it a</p><p>4 0.8941099 <a title="1578-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-14-Learning_how_to_speak.html">1938 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-14-Learning how to speak</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>5 0.88572836 <a title="1578-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Cash_in%2C_cash_out_graph.html">502 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Cash in, cash out graph</a></p>

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).
  
I agree that (a) the graph could be improved in small ways–in particular, adding half-year data seems like a great idea–and (b) it’s a wonderful, wonderful graph as is.

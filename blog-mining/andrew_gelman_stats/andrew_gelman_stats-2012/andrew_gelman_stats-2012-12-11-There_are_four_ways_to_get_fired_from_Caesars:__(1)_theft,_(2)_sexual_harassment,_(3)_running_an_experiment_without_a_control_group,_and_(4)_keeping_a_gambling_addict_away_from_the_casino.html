<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: When linking to my  review  of Duncan Watts’s book in a recent post, I came across some fun bits that I’d like to share (for those of you who didn’t just click through and read the whole thing):
 
On business books:
  
I’m not so interested in the business angle but I suppose that’s how you sell books these days. The business part of the book was ok—I’m not saying it was filler—it’s just that I’m not particularly interested in which format of videocassette wins, or whether Cisco Systems is a well-run company. I realize that a lot of people care about this sort of things nowadays, but I’d rather talk about sports or politics.
  
On dodgy science writer John Gribbin:
  
Sure, people write all sorts of silly things but usually they have some sort of political or religious excuse for why it’s ok to believe them. Truth is not the only important value in life, there are also other concerns such as political convictions, religious beliefs, and the simple desire to avoid offending people.

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture. And when we look at world-wide revenues, this film brought in more than $1.5 billion. . . . Despite what seems like a clear endorsement by the customers of this industry, the Avengers was ignored by the Oscars.

<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.


Firstly, just because someone is a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, or any kind of successful entrepreneur for that matter, doesn’t mean they should be trusted with oth</p><p>6 0.8534981 <a title="1619-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amy Hundley writes in the New Yorker about a notorious recent case of unacknowledged literary  quilting :
  
I [Hundley] was the editor at Grove/Atlantic to whom Quentin Rowan’s novel “Appearance and the Park” was submitted (“The Plagiarist’s Tale,” by Lizzie Widdicombe, February 13th & 20th). Widdicombe writes that the editor in question thought that “its plot was too close to that of another of the house’s books, ‘My Idea of Fun,’ by Will Self,” and I can only assume that this explanation came from Rowan. In fact, Rowan had lifted a passage nearly verbatim from Will Self’s novella “The Sweet Smell of Psychosis.” It was an especially delicious one, in which Self describes the media denizens of a particular bar. I recognized it immediately and informed his agent that he’d plagiarized it. Writing a plot similar to a successful novelist’s—something that can arise innocently—is very different from plagiarizing. Appropriating and remixing someone else’s work while acknowledging sources is</p><p>2 0.96565074 <a title="1619-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Stand_Your_Ground_laws_and_homicides.html">1397 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Stand Your Ground laws and homicides</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  reports  on the sympathy that well-known physicist Freeman Dyson has with crackpot theorists.  The interesting part is that Dyson has positive feelings for these cranks,  even while believing that their theories are completely wrong :
  
In my [Dyson's] career as a scientist, I twice had the good fortune to be a personal friend of a famous dissident. One dissident, Sir Arthur Eddington, was an insider like Thomson and Tait. The other, Immanuel Velikovsky, was an outsider like Carter. Both of them were tragic figures, intellectually brilliant and morally courageous, with the same fatal flaw as Carter. Both of them were possessed by fantasies that people with ordinary common sense could recognize as nonsense. I made it clear to both that I did not believe their fantasies, but I admired them as human beings and as imaginative artists. I admired them most of all for their stubborn refusal to remain silent. With the whole world against them, they remained true to their beliefs.</p><p>4 0.96434909 <a title="1619-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>5 0.95712948 <a title="1619-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-17-Big_corporations_are_more_popular_than_you_might_realize.html">1123 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-17-Big corporations are more popular than you might realize</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes , “people tend to like cities more than firms . . . people tend to dislike bigger firms more than small ones, cities tend to be bigger than firms, and the biggest cities tend to be the most celebrated.”
 
Hansen goes on to consider explanations (involving “the joy of sometimes dominating,” etc.) but ends up describing himself as confused.
 
One reason he might be confused is that, at least in the data I’ve seen, people  don’t  dislike big corporations—at least not when the corporation is named.
 
Consider some  survey data  from 2007:
 
   
 
OK, sure, now that there’s a recession on, Citibank probably doesn’t have 78% approval anymore.  Still, these companies are pretty damn popular.  You might think lots of Americans think Starbucks is stuck-up?  Nope.  79% approval.  Pfizer?  77%.  I have no idea why Target is so much more popular than Walmart, but in any case all these numbers (with the exception of oil-spillin’ Exxon and war-profitin’ Halliburton) are stratosp</p><p>6 0.94973958 <a title="1619-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-28-Asymmetry_in_Political_Bias.html">683 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-28-Asymmetry in Political Bias</a></p>

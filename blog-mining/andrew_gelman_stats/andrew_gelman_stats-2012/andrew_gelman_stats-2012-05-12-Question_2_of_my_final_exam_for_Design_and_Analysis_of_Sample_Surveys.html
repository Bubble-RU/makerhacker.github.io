<p>Introduction: 18. A survey is taken of 100 undergraduates, 100 graduate students, and 100 continuing education students at a university. Assume a simple random sample within each group. Each student is asked to rate his or her satisfaction (on a 1–10 scale) with his or her experiences. Write the estimate and standard error of the average satisfaction of all the students at the university. Introduce notation as necessary for all the information needed to solve the problem.
 
 Solution to question 17 
 
From  yesterday :
  
17. In a survey of n people, half are asked if they support “the health care law recently passed by Congress” and half are asked if they support “the law known as Obamacare.” The goal is to estimate the effect of the wording on the proportion of Yes responses. How large must n be for the effect to be estimated within a standard error of 5 percentage points?
  
Solution:  se is sqrt(.5*.5/(n/2)+.5*.5/(n/2)) = 1/sqrt(n).  Solve 1/sqrt(n) = .05, you get n = (1/.05)^2 = 400.</p><p>5 0.19834891 <a title="1315-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-04-Statistics_ethics_question.html">695 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-04-Statistics ethics question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A graduate student in public health writes:
  
I have been asked to do the statistical analysis for a medical unit that is delivering a pilot study of a program to [details redacted to prevent identification]. They are using a prospective, nonrandomized, cohort-controlled trial study design.


The investigator thinks they can recruit only a small number of treatment and control cases, maybe less than 30 in total.  After I told the Investigator that I cannot do anything statistically with a sample size that small, he responded that small sample sizes are common in this field, and he send me an example of analysis that someone had done on a similar study.


So he still wants me to come up with a statistical plan. Is it unethical for me to do anything other than descriptive statistics? I think he should just stick to qualitative research. But the study she mentions above has 40 subjects and apparently had enough power to detect some effects. This is a pilot study after all so the n does n</p><p>6 0.19799161 <a title="1315-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Question_28_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1371 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Question 28 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

Give an estimate and standard error for the percentage of spoiled vegetables for the entire chain.

From  yesterday :
  
21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
  
Solution:  Nonproportional sampling is usually avoided because it makes the analysis more complicated and it results in a higher standard error for estimates of the general population.  It might be a good idea her</p><p>4 0.78931189 <a title="1315-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-14-Question_4_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1320 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-14-Question 4 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

Which of these designs has the lowest variance? Why might the higher-variance design still be chosen?
 
 Solution to question 23 
 
From  yesterday :
  
23. Suppose you are conducting a survey in which people are asked about their health behaviors (how often they wash their hands, how often they go to the doctor, etc.). There is a concern that different interviewers will get different sorts of responsesâ&euro;&rdquo;that is, there may be important interviewer effects. Describe (in two sentences) how you could estimate the interviewer effects within your survey.

<p>Introduction: 2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.
 
(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.
 
(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.
 
(d) With a small sample size, you cannot hope to learn anything conclusive, but you can get a crude estimate of effect size and standard deviation which will be useful in a power analysis to help you decide how large your full study needs to be.
 
(e) You can talk with survey respondents and get a sense of how they perceived your questions.
 
(f) You get a chance to learn about practical difficulties with sampling, nonresponse, and question wording.
 
(g) You can check if your sample is approximately representative of your population.

<p>Introduction: John Sides  discusses  how his scatterplot of unionization rates and budget deficits made it onto cable TV news:
  
It’s also interesting to see how he [journalist Chris Hayes] chooses to explain a scatterplot — especially given the evidence that people don’t always understand scatterplots. He compares pairs of cases that don’t illustrate the basic hypothesis of Brooks, Scott Walker, et al. Obviously, such comparisons could be misleading, but given that there was no systematic relationship depicted that graph, these particular comparisons are not.
  
This idea–summarizing a bivariate pattern by comparing pairs of points–reminds me of a well-known statistical identities which I refer to in  a paper  with David Park:
 
 
 
John Sides is certainly correct that if you can pick your pair of points, you can make extremely misleading comparisons.  But if you pick  every  pair of points, and average over them appropriately, you end up with the least-squares regression slope.

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email: 
  
  
Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.

<p>Introduction: Jay Ulfelder asks:
  
I have a question for you about what to do in a situation where you have two measures of your dependent variable and no prior reasons to strongly favor one over the other.


Here’s what brings this up: I’m working on a project with Michael Ross where we’re modeling transitions to and from democracy in countries worldwide since 1960 to estimate the effects of oil income on the likelihood of those events’ occurrence. We’ve got a TSCS data set, and we’re using a discrete-time event history design, splitting the sample by regime type at the start of each year and then using multilevel logistic regression models with parametric measures of time at risk and random intercepts at the country and region levels. (We’re also checking for the usefulness of random slopes for oil wealth at one or the other level and then including them if they improve a model’s goodness of fit.) All of this is being done in Stata with the gllamm module.

</p><p>7 I sometimes worry that our universities, which are systems of formal education and formalized research environments, have become too orthodox. [sent-12, score-0.094]
</p><p>8 I’m sure the orthodoxies are largely true and justified. [sent-13, score-0.405]
</p><p>9 I’m just not sure we’re giving each other, and ourselves, the time we need to believe in them. [sent-14, score-0.219]
</p><p>10 Basbøll’s comments about belieiving what one writes (which, I think might be even better labeled as “provisional belief”) reminds me of some things I’ve written with Shalizi (for example,  this ) on the importance of strong assumptions in statistical learning. [sent-15, score-0.431]
</p><p>11 In short, strong assuptions play two roles:  First, with strong assumps we can (often) make strong and precise inferences. [sent-16, score-0.884]
</p><p>12 Second, strong assumptions are strongly checkable and falsifiable. [sent-18, score-0.458]
</p><p>13 We take our models seriously, work with them as if we believe them unquestioningly, then use the leverage from this simulation of belief to check model fit and explore discrepancies between inferences and data. [sent-19, score-0.595]
</p><p>14 But belief is risky, especially since all of our beliefs, if stated precisely enough, our false. [sent-23, score-0.315]
</p><p>15 The resolution is that we can use the strength and power of beliefs to better study their limitations. [sent-24, score-0.187]
</p><p>16 I think Basbøll’s argument would be much stronger if he could support it with a factual story involving mountaineering. [sent-27, score-0.183]
</p><p>17 In the absence of such a story, he has to present his claims as raw speculation backed only by his introspection and personal experience. [sent-28, score-0.411]

</p><p>19 But if Basbøll were to use someone else’s writing, he’d have a dilemma:  cite the source and then reveal it’s just a story, not something that actually happened; or don’t cite any source and then maybe get busted for copying someone else’s work without attribution. [sent-31, score-0.504]
</p><p>20 This could be a serious blow to the sort of sensemaking scholarship that is Basbøll’s specialty. [sent-33, score-0.247]

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll [yes, I've learned how to smoothly do this using alt-o] gives  some writing advice :
  
What gives a text presence is our commitment to asserting facts. We have to face the possibility that we may be wrong about them resolutely, and we do this by writing about them as though we are right.
  
This and an earlier  remark  by Basbøll are closely related in my mind to predictive model checking and to  Bayesian statistics :  we make strong assumptions and then engage the data and the assumptions in a dialogue:  assumptions + data -> inference, and we can then compare the inference to the data which can reveal problems with our model (or problems with the data, but that’s really problems with the model too, in this case problems with the model for the data).
 
I like the idea that a condition for a story to be useful is that we put some belief into it.  (One doesn’t put belief into a joke.)  And also the converse, that thnking hard about a story and believing it can be the pre</p><p>3 0.21687073 <a title="1269-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-07-Not_much_difference_between_communicating_to_self_and_communicating_to_others.html">1408 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-07-Not much difference between communicating to self and communicating to others</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As a statistician I am particularly worried about the rhetorical power of anecdotes (even though I use them in my own reasoning; see discussion below).  But much can be learned from a  true  anecdote.  The rough edges—the places where the anecdote doesn’t fit your thesis—these are where you learn.
 
We have recently had a discussion ( here  and  here ) of Karl Weick, a prominent scholar of business management who plagiarized a story and then went on to draw different lessons from the pilfered anecdote in several different publications published over many years.
 
Setting aside an issues of plagiarism and rulebreaking, I argue that, by hiding the source of the story and changing its form, Weick and his management-science audience are losing their ability to get anything out of it beyond empty confirmation.

<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>6 0.82531399 <a title="1269-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-19-Chomsky_chomsky_chomsky_chomsky_furiously.html">1812 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-19-Chomsky chomsky chomsky chomsky furiously</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a discussion of his variant of the write-a-thousand-words-a-day strategy (as he puts it, “a system for the production of academic results in writing”), Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
Believe the claims you are making. That is, confine yourself to making claims you believe. I always emphasize this when I [Basbøll] define knowledge as “justified, true belief”. . . . I think if there is one sure way to undermine your sense of your own genius it is to begin to say things you know to be publishable without being sure they are true. Or even things you know to be “true” but don’t understand well enough to believe.
  
He points out that this is not so easy:
  
In times when there are strong orthodoxies it can sometimes be difficult to know what to believe. Or, rather, it is all too easy to know what to believe (what the “right belief” is). It is therefore difficult to stick to statements of one’s own belief. I sometimes worry that our universities, which are systems of formal education and for</p><p>2 0.96706855 <a title="1269-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Causal_inference_in_economics.html">32 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Causal inference in economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>3 0.96599132 <a title="1269-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Alper writes:
  
Unless I missed it, you haven’t commented on the recent  article  of Michael Bang Peterson [with Daniel Sznycer, Aaron Sell, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby].  It seems to have been reviewed extensively in the lay press.  A typical example is  here .  This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>5 0.96406025 <a title="1269-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-22-Goal%3A__Rules_for_Turing_chess.html">1818 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-22-Goal:  Rules for Turing chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Murell has more thoughts on  Turing chess  (last discussed  here ):
  
When I played with my brother, we had it that if you managed to lap someone while running around the house, then you got an additional move. This means that if you had the option to take the king on your additional move, you could, and doing so won you the game. He was fitter at the time so he slipped in two additional moves over the course of the game. I still won :) I am much better at him at chess though, so I’m sure he would have beaten me had we been more even.


W.r.t. dsquared’s  comment  and your response, I’m not overly concerned about the first move, because you can enforce that white must reach a halfway point or that some time interval elapse before black makes his first move.


This version though does have one significant weakness that is evident to me. If you wait a little for your opponent to return to make his second move in a row against you, you get your breath back.

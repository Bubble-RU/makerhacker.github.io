<p>Introduction: After noting the increasing political conservatism of people in the poorer states, Richard Florida  writes :
  
The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism’s hold on America’s states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal.


Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward.


But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political. This ideological state of affairs advantages the policy preferences of poorer, less innovative states over wealthier, more innovative, and productive ones. American politics is increasingly disconnected from its economic engine.  And this deepening political divide has become pe</p><p>3 0.26230928 <a title="1485-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-10-What_happens_when_the_Democrats_are_%E2%80%9Cfighting_Wall_Street_with_one_hand%2C_unions_with_the_other%2C%E2%80%9D_while_the_Republicans_are_fighting_unions_with_two_hands%3F.html">79 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-10-What happens when the Democrats are “fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other,” while the Republicans are fighting unions with two hands?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>4 0.23127867 <a title="1485-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-08-Charles_Murray_%5Bperhaps%5D_does_a_Tucker_Carlson%2C_provoking_me_to_unleash_the_usual_torrent_of_graphs.html">1159 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-08-Charles Murray [perhaps] does a Tucker Carlson, provoking me to unleash the usual torrent of graphs</a></p>

[I’ve interjected a “perhaps” into the title of this blog post to indicate that I don’t have the exact Murray quote here so I’m relying on David Frum’s interpretation.]
 
Frum does me the favor of citing Red State Blue State as evidence, and I’d like to back this up with some graphs.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).

I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: Jeffrey Frankel, identified as a former member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers,  writes  (link from  here ):
  
As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. . . .


The unspoken truth is that, compared to “blue-staters,” those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies.
  
An unspoken truth, huh?  Wow, that really sucks!  Something should be done about it.  Good thing that this Harvard professor and former member of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors is on the case:

<p>Introduction: We have lots of models for overdispersed count data but we rarely see underdispersed data.  But now I know what example I’ll be giving when this next comes up in class.  From a  book review  by Theo Tait:
  
A number of shark species go in for oophagy, or uterine cannibalism. Sand tiger foetuses ‘eat each other in utero, acting out the harshest form of sibling rivalry imaginable’. Only two babies emerge, one from each of the mother shark’s uteruses: the survivors have eaten everything else. ‘A female sand tiger gives birth to a baby that’s already a metre long and an experienced killer,’ explains Demian Chapman, an expert on the subject.
  
That’s what I call underdispersion.  E(y)=2, var(y)=0.  Take that, M. Poisson!</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9143756 <a title="1485-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-06-One_reason_New_York_isn%E2%80%99t_as_rich_as_it_used_to_be%3A__Redistribution_of_federal_tax_money_to_other_states.html">1485 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-06-One reason New York isn’t as rich as it used to be:  Redistribution of federal tax money to other states</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>3 0.90797079 <a title="1485-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-What_are_the_standards_for_reliability_in_experimental_psychology%3F.html">1101 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-What are the standards for reliability in experimental psychology?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An experimental psychologist was wondering about the standards in that field for “acceptable reliability” (when looking at inter-rater reliability in coding data).  He wondered, for example, if some variation on signal detectability theory might be applied to adjust for inter-rater differences in criteria for saying some code is present.
 
What about Cohen’s kappa?  The psychologist wrote:
  
Cohen’s kappa does adjust for “guessing,” but its assumptions are not well motivated, perhaps not any more than adjustments for guessing versus the application of signal detectability theory where that can be applied. But one can’t do a straightforward application of signal detectability theory for reliability in that you don’t know whether the signal is present or not.
  
I think measurement issues are important but I don’t have enough experience in this area to answer the question without knowing more about the problem that this researcher is working on.

<p>Introduction: That’s ok , Krugman earlier  slammed  Galbraith.  (I wonder if Krugman is as big a fan of “tough choices” now as he was  in 1996 .)  Given Krugman’s politicization in recent years, I’m surprised he’s so dismissive of the political (rather than technical-economic) nature of Hayek’s influence.  (I don’t know if he’s changed his views on Galbraith in recent years.)
 
P.S.  Greg Mankiw, in contrast,  labels  Galbraith and Hayek as “two of the great economists of the 20th century” and writes, “even though their most famous works were written many decades ago, they are still well worth reading today.”</p><p>5 0.8833214 <a title="1485-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-06-The_K_Foundation_burns_Cosma%E2%80%99s_turkey.html">1044 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-06-The K Foundation burns Cosma’s turkey</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Shalizi  delivers  a slow, drawn-out illustration of the point that economic efficiency is all about who’s got the $, which isn’t always related to what we would usually call “efficiency” in other settings.  (His point is related to my  argument  that the phrase “willingness to pay” should generally be replaced by “ability to pay.”)
 
The basic story is simple:  Good guy  needs  a turkey, bad guy  wants  a turkey.  Bad guy is willing and able to pay more for the turkey than good guy can afford, hence good guy starves to death.
 
The counterargument is that a market in turkeys will motivate producers to breed more turkeys, ultimately saturating the bad guys’ desires and leaving surplus turkeys for the good guys at a reasonable price.
 
I’m sure there’s a counter-counterargument too, but I don’t want to go there.
 
But what really amused me about Cosma’s essay was how he scrambled the usual cultural/political associations.  (I assume he did this on purpose.)

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard all sorts of scare stories of what it’s like to speak in an academic economics seminar:  they’re rude, they interrupt constantly, they don’t let you get through three slides in an hour, etc.  But whenever I’ve actually spoke in an economics department, the people have been polite and well-behaved, really it’s been like any other seminar. 
   
I mentioned this to some people awhile ago and they said that the nasty-economist thing only happens in the top departments.  I’d spoken at Columbia (which, if not at the very top, is still respectable), but that was in the political economy seminar and I’m a political scientist, so maybe they were nice to me because I’m local.  And the other econ departments where I’d spoken were in Europe (maybe they’re nicer there) or at non-elite institutions in the U.S.  So I called my friend at Harvard econ, told him my story, and asked if I could speak there.  He duly booked me for the Harvard-MIT econometrics seminar.
 
I  spoke  at the seminar,</p><p>3 0.18488482 <a title="1526-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-17-G%2B_hangout_for_test_run_of_BDA_course.html">2066 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-17-G+ hangout for test run of BDA course</a></p>

 Little data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big-data world 
  
At the end of the day, after all the processing, big data are being used to answer little- data questions such as, Does an observed pattern generalize to the larger population?, or Could it be explained by alternative processes (sometimes called “chance”)? We discuss some recent ideas in the world of “little data” that remain of big importance.</p><p>5 0.15596919 <a title="1526-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-Just_gave_a_talk.html">2275 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-Just gave a talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>6 0.14037523 <a title="1526-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-25-Chris_Schmid_on_Evidence_Based_Medicine.html">1138 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-25-Chris Schmid on Evidence Based Medicine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: So, I’m at MIT, twenty minutes into my  talk  on tradeoffs in information graphics to the computer scientists, when the power goes out.  They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.  It went well, perhaps better than the actual talk would’ve gone, even though they didn’t get to see most of my  slides .</p><p>3 0.87503904 <a title="1526-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>2 0.95529807 <a title="1526-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-13-Randomized_experiments%2C_non-randomized_experiments%2C_and_observational_studies.html">340 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-13-Randomized experiments, non-randomized experiments, and observational studies</a></p>

I just talk about causal inference.  These people do it.  The second link above is particularly interesting because it includes discussions by some causal inference heavyweights.

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.  But still.</p><p>4 0.95131767 <a title="1526-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-It_depends_upon_what_the_meaning_of_the_word_%E2%80%9Cfirm%E2%80%9D_is..html">940 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-It depends upon what the meaning of the word “firm” is.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.94969863 <a title="1526-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-09-%EF%BF%BCLittle_Data%3A_How_traditional_statistical_ideas_remain_relevant_in_a_big-data_world.html">1526 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-09-￼Little Data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big-data world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: See if you can interpolate the talk from the  slides .
 
The background is:  I was invited to speak in this seminar on “big data.”  I said I didn’t know anything about big data, I worked on little data.  They said that was ok.  Actually it was probably a crowd-pleasing move to tell these people that little-data ideas remain relevant.</p><p>6 0.94651639 <a title="1526-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-31-Using_factor_analysis_or_principal_components_analysis_or_measurement-error_models_for_biological_measurements_in_archaeology%3F.html">1094 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-31-Using factor analysis or principal components analysis or measurement-error models for biological measurements in archaeology?</a></p>

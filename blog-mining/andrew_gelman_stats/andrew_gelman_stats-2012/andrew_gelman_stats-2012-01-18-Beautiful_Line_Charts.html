A paradox of competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I switched to the mac and it’s great  I’d like a bit more real estate on my laptop but Malecki assures me that soon I’ll get used to jumping between windows.
 
Anyway, my impression is that now the mac dominates the pc, but a few years ago it wasn’t so clear.  The mac had some nice features but often ran slowly, and thinkpads could do a lot.  At the time, the way I understood this was that only one company made macs but several made pc’s, thus there was a lot of competition, stimulating innovation in the pc market.
 
But what’s the story now?  The macbook air is awesome and a real advance on what came before, while the thinkpads and all the rest have stagnated.  So what’s my new theory?  There’s lots of competition on pc’s, but what they’re all competing on is price.  Meanwhile, only one company makes the mac and so they have the freedom to make something good.
 
But I’m just blathering here.  I’m sure someone can offer some thick description to reveal the real story.</p><p>4 0.16887975 <a title="1125-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-09-The_quest_for_the_holy_graph.html">794 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-09-The quest for the holy graph</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Robert Gonzalez  reports  on some  beautiful graphs  from John Nelson. Here’s Nelson:
 
 
         The sexes start out homogenous, go super segregated in the teen years, segregate for business in the twenty-somethings, and re-couple for co-habitation years.  Then the lights fade into faint pockets of pink.   
 
  
I [Nelson] am using simple tract-level population/gender counts from the US Census Bureau. Because their tract boundaries extend into the water and vacant area, I used NYC’s Bytes of the Big Apple zoning shapes to clip the census tracts to residentially zoned areas -giving me a more realistic (and more recognizable) definition of populated areas. The census breaks out their population counts by gender for five-year age spans ranging from teeny tiny infants through esteemed 85+ year-olds.
  
And here’s Gonzalez:
  
Between ages 0 and 14, the entire map is more or less an evenly mixed purple landscape; newborns, children and adolescents, after all, can’t really choose where the</p><p>3 0.77817065 <a title="1125-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-23-MLB_Hall_of_Fame_Voting_Trajectories.html">1689 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-23-MLB Hall of Fame Voting Trajectories</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I stumbled across a chart that’s in my opinion the best way to express a comparison of quantities through time:
 
   
 
It  compares  the new PC companies, such as Apple, to traditional PC companies like IBM and Compaq, but on the same scale. If you’d like to see how iPads and other novelties compare, see  here . I’ve tried to use the same type of visualization in my old work on  legal data visualization .
 
  
 
It comes from a new market research firm Asymco that also produced a very clean  income vs expenses  visualization (click to enlarge):
 
   
 
While the first figure is pure perfection, Tufte purists might find the second one too colorful. But to a busy person, color helps tell things apart: when I know that pink means interest, it takes a fraction of the second to assess the situation. We live in 2012, not in 1712 to have to think black and white.
 
Finally, they have a few other interesting uses of interactive visualization, such as  cellular-broadband infrastructure  around</p><p>2 0.90651202 <a title="1125-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-28-My_talk_on_statistical_graphics_at_Mit_this_Thurs_aft.html">1594 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-28-My talk on statistical graphics at Mit this Thurs aft</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Infovis and Statistical Graphics: Different Goals, Different Looks  (and  here’s  the article)

The importance of graphical displays in statistical practice has been recognized sporadically in the statistical literature over the past century, with wider awareness following Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis (1977) and Tufte’s books in the succeeding decades. But statistical graphics still occupies an awkward in-between position: Within statistics, exploratory and graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well-integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) is huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statisti</p><p>3 0.90389967 <a title="1125-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-22-%E2%80%9CInformation_visualization%E2%80%9D_vs._%E2%80%9CStatistical_graphics%E2%80%9D.html">816 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-22-“Information visualization” vs. “Statistical graphics”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By now you all must be tired of my one-sided presentations of the differences between infovis and statgraphics (for example,  this article  with Antony Unwin).
 
Today is something different.  Courtesy of Martin Theus, editor of the Statistical Computing and Graphics Newsletter, we have two short articles offering competing perspectives:
 
Robert Kosara writes from an Infovis view:
  
Information visualization is a field that has had trouble defining its boundaries, and that consequently is often misunderstood. It doesn’t help that InfoVis, as it is also known, produces pretty pictures that people like to look at and link to or send around. But InfoVis is more than pretty pictures, and it is more than statistical graphics.


The key to understanding InfoVis is to ignore the images for a moment and focus on the part that is often lost: interaction. When we use visualization tools, we don’t just create one image or one kind of visualization. In fact, most people would argue that there is</p><p>4 0.89955318 <a title="1125-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-20-A_qualified_but_incomplete_thanks_to_Gregg_Easterbrook%E2%80%99s_editor_at_Reuters.html">966 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-20-A qualified but incomplete thanks to Gregg Easterbrook’s editor at Reuters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Reuters editor:
 
Thanks for reading  my blog  and correcting the erroneous numbers in Easterbrook’s  column  from the other day.
 
I’m pretty sure you got the corrections from my blog because in your corrections you used  the exact same links  that I posted.  I think your readers will like that you gave links to the sources of your numbers.
 
But I’d appreciate if you cite me!  It’s considered polite to credit your sources rather than just copying over numbers and links with no mention of where they came from.  Unlike Easterbrook, I’m not expecting to be paid for this material but I’d still like to be thanked.
 
(See the last paragraph of  this post  by Felix Salmon for more on the desirability of linking to your sources.)
 
Also, since you’re correcting the article anyway, maybe you could go back and change this sentence too:
  
But don’t sell Huntsman short because he is low in the polls – Obama had been at that point, too.
  
As I noted earlier,

<p>Introduction: As we get more data, we can fit more model.  But at some point we become so overwhelmed by data that, for computational reasons, we can barely do anything at all.  Thus, the curve above could be thought of as the product of two curves:  a steadily increasing curve showing the  statistical  ability to fit more complex models with more data, and a steadily decreasing curve showing the  computational  feasibility of doing so.</p><p>6 0.89445275 <a title="1125-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-22-Spell-checking_example_demonstrates_key_aspects_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">2182 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-22-Spell-checking example demonstrates key aspects of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>

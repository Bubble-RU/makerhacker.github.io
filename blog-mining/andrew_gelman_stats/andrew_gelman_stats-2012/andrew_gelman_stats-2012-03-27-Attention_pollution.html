<p>Introduction: I  agree  with  Casey Mulligan  that participants in government surveys should be paid, and I think it should be part of the code of ethics for commercial pollsters to compensate their respondents also.
 
As Mulligan points out, if a survey is worth doing, it should be worth compensating the participants for their time and effort.
 
P.S.  Just to clarify, I do  not  recommend that Census surveys be made voluntary, I just think that respondents (who can be required to participate) should be paid a small amount.

The premise of  the column  this guy is starting is interesting:  Noah Davis interviews a smart person and then interviews the smartest person that smart person knows and so on. 


It reminded me of you mentioning survey design strategy of asking people about other people, like “How many people do you know named Stuart?” or “How many people do you know that have had an abortion?”


Ignoring the interview aspect of what this guy is doing, I think there’s some cool questions about the distribution/path behavior of smartest-person-I-know chains (say, seeded at random).  Do they loop?  If so, how long do they run before looping, how large are the loops?  What parts of the population do the explore?  Do you know of anything that’s been done on something like this?
  
My reply:  Interesting question.  It could be asked of any referral chain, for example asking a sequence of people, “Who’s the tallest person you know?” or “Who’s the best piano player you know” or “Who’</p><p>3 0.70846373 <a title="1231-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-%24.html">1003 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Salmon is dismissive of the claim that there are fifty million over-the-air television viewers:

 
The 50 million number, by the way, should not be considered particularly reliable: it’s Aereo’s guess as to the number of people who ever watch free-to-air TV, even if they mainly watch cable or satellite. (Maybe they have a hut somewhere with an old rabbit-ear TV in it.)
 

And he strongly suggests the number is not only smaller but shrinking. By comparison, here’s a story from the broadcasting news site TV News Check from June of last year (if anyone has more recent numbers please let me know):

 
According to new research by GfK Media, the number of Americans now relying solely on over-the-air (OTA) television reception increased to almost 54 million, up from 46 million just a year ago. The recently completed survey also found that the demographics of broadcast-only households skew towards younger adults, minorities and lower-income families.

<p>Introduction: I just got called by a robo-poll.  I really think there should be a law that anyone who wants to call like this should be a real person and supply their home phone number.  This sort of one-way contact is nothing more than harassment.  As well as poisoning the well by reducing the inclination of people to participate in legitimate surveys.</p><p>2 0.96652567 <a title="1231-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis_testing_with_multiple_imputations.html">799 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis testing with multiple imputations</a></p>

I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution? Do I combine the 5 imputed data set into one by averaging each imputed values so I get one single imputed data and compare with the ob</p><p>3 0.96207118 <a title="1231-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Clarity_on_my_email_policy.html">503 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Clarity on my email policy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Radford  writes :
  
The word “conservative” gets used many ways, for various political purposes, but I would take it’s basic meaning to be someone who thinks there’s a lot of wisdom in traditional ways of doing things, even if we don’t understand exactly why those ways are good, so we should be reluctant to change unless we have a strong argument that some other way is better. This sounds very Bayesian, with a prior reducing the impact of new data.
  
I agree completely, and I think Radford will very much enjoy  my article with Aleks Jakulin , “Bayes: radical, liberal, or conservative?”  Radford’s comment also fits with my increasing inclination to use informative prior distributions.</p><p>5 0.95863062 <a title="1231-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-17-Macro_causality.html">807 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-17-Macro causality</a></p>

 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics.  The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money.  But how do we know it’s not the reverse:  that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well.  As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true.  What I’d call the demand-side story (more spending leads to more output) is everywhere, including this piece, from the usually reliable David Leonhardt.
  
This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?
 
Regarding the causal question, I’d like to move away from the idea of “Does A causes B or does B cause A” and toward a more intervention-based framework (Rubin’s model for</p><p>6 0.95852542 <a title="1231-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-10-Small_multiples_of_lineplots_%3E_maps_%28ok%2C_not_always%2C_but_yes_in_this_case%29.html">2288 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-10-Small multiples of lineplots > maps (ok, not always, but yes in this case)</a></p>

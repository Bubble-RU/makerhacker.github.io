All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.

</p><p>2 As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes so that this group represents a much smaller share of the electorate. [sent-9, score-0.217]
</p><p>3 I think it’s reasonable to study this group and to understand their psychological motivations, just at it also makes sense to consider the psychological motivations of higher-income whites who tend to have more conservative economic attitudes and are more likely to vote Republican. [sent-10, score-1.252]
</p><p>4 In particular, one thing we’ve found is that higher-income and higher-education voters tend to be more constrained in their political attitudes. [sent-11, score-0.319]
</p><p>5 Pro-abortion whites were over twenty percentage points more likely than anti-abortion whites to vote for Obama, and this difference was largest among high-income, high-education whites. [sent-13, score-0.949]
</p><p>6 In contrast, pro-abortion Hispanics and anti-abortion Hispanics voted nearly identically for president. [sent-14, score-0.163]
</p><p>7 Rich conservative whites are often showing a lot of consistency, or constraint, with highly conservative attitudes on economic and social issues. [sent-15, score-1.097]
</p><p>8 The big picture, here, I think, is that we need to look at the entire electorate rather than picking out individual pieces. [sent-16, score-0.076]
</p><p>9 I find a lot to like in Thomas Frank’s book, but Kansas is only one state—actually, a state that’s been strongly Republican for nearly a century—and I think people were misled by taking it as a stand-in for the whole country. [sent-17, score-0.379]
</p><p>10 That’s one of the themes of Red State Blue State:  political commentators focus on the parts of the country they know well, then they jump to generalizations about the rest of the country. [sent-18, score-0.211]
</p><p>11 Also, the term “blue collar,” which is sometimes used, ratchets the Republican-ness up another notch, as it is typically men, not women, whose jobs are categorized as blue collar. [sent-20, score-0.25]
</p><p>12 Finally, I think there is something to the conservative talking point about public employees, the idea that some people (in particular, ethnic minorities and public sector employees) are beneficiaries of taxes whereas other people (often in the private sector) are payers of taxes. [sent-21, score-0.526]
</p><p>13 And this sort of personal experience does inform one’s political ideology, even though the correlation is not 100%, for example military officers tend to be conservative and Republican. [sent-22, score-0.78]
</p><p>14 In most groups of the population—especially the more conservative and Republican groups—richer people are more conservative. [sent-23, score-0.375]
</p><p>15 For example, military officers are much more conservative than military enlisted personnel. [sent-24, score-0.832]
</p><p>16 This is one reason why I think that people such as Haidt who study psychology of voting should look at upper-class as well as lower-class voters. [sent-25, score-0.199]
</p><p>17 As I noted earlier, lower-class whites (especially in the south) may well be trending Republican, but upper-class whites are even more strongly in the Republican camp, and it’s worth understanding their motivations as well. [sent-26, score-1.07]

<p>Introduction: Stephen Olivier points me to this horrible, horrible  news article  by Jonathan Haidt, “Why working-class people vote conservative”:
  
Across the world, blue-collar voters ally themselves with the political right . . . Why on Earth would a working-class person ever vote for a conservative candidate? This question has obsessed the American left since Ronald Reagan first captured the votes of so many union members, farmers, urban Catholics and other relatively powerless people – the so-called “Reagan Democrats”. . . .
  
Sorry, but no no no no no.  Where to start?
 
Here’s the difference between upper-income and lower-income votes in presidential elections:
 
   
 
Ronald Reagan did about 20 percentage points better among voters in the upper third of income, compared to voters in the lower third.  The relation between income and voting since 1980 is about the same as it was in the 1940s.
 
Oh yeah, Haidt said something about “across the world.”  How bout this:

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.28439942 <a title="1385-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Same_old_story.html">1229 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Same old story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a review of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” William Saletan  writes :
  
You’re smart. You’re liberal. You’re well informed. You think conservatives are narrow-minded. You can’t understand why working-class Americans vote Republican. You figure they’re being duped. You’re wrong. . . .


Haidt diverges from other psychologists who have analyzed the left’s electoral failures. The usual argument of these psycho-­pundits is that conservative politicians manipulate voters’ neural roots — playing on our craving for authority, for example — to trick people into voting against their interests. But Haidt treats electoral success as a kind of evolutionary fitness test. He figures that if voters like Republican messages, there’s something in Republican messages worth liking. He chides psychologists who try to “explain away” conservatism, treating it as a pathology. Conservatism thrives because it fits how people think, and that’s what validates it. Workers who</p><p>5 0.24237746 <a title="1385-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-23-Voting_patterns_of_America%E2%80%99s_whites%2C_from_the_masses_to_the_elites.html">1227 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-23-Voting patterns of America’s whites, from the masses to the elites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Within any education category, richer people vote more Republican. In contrast, the pattern of education and voting is nonlinear. High school graduates are more Republican than non-HS grads, but after that, the groups with more education tend to vote more Democratic. At the very highest education level tabulated in the survey, voters with post-graduate degrees lean toward the Democrats. Except for the rich post-graduates; they are split 50-50 between the parties.
 
What does this say about America’s elites? If you define elites as high-income non-Hispanic whites, the elites vote strongly Republican. If you define elites as college-educated high-income whites, they vote moderately Republican.
 
There is no plausible way based on these data in which elites can be considered a Democratic voting bloc. To create a group of strongly Democratic-leaning elite whites using these graphs, you would need to consider only postgraduates (no simple college grads included, even if they have achieved s</p><p>6 0.23570395 <a title="1385-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-The_moral_of_the_story_is%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_look_yourself_up_on_Google.html">125 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-The moral of the story is, Don’t look yourself up on Google</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>5 0.85987401 <a title="1385-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Same_old_story.html">1229 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Same old story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a review of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” William Saletan  writes :
  
You’re smart. You’re liberal. You’re well informed. You think conservatives are narrow-minded. You can’t understand why working-class Americans vote Republican. You figure they’re being duped. You’re wrong. . . .


Haidt diverges from other psychologists who have analyzed the left’s electoral failures. The usual argument of these psycho-­pundits is that conservative politicians manipulate voters’ neural roots — playing on our craving for authority, for example — to trick people into voting against their interests. But Haidt treats electoral success as a kind of evolutionary fitness test. He figures that if voters like Republican messages, there’s something in Republican messages worth liking. He chides psychologists who try to “explain away” conservatism, treating it as a pathology. Conservatism thrives because it fits how people think, and that’s what validates it.

<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>same-blog 3 0.95186627 <a title="1385-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling_different_claims_about_working-class_voters.html">1385 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling different claims about working-class voters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>4 0.94873345 <a title="1385-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-15-New_prize_on_causality_in_statstistics_education.html">1624 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-15-New prize on causality in statstistics education</a></p>

I responded that I’m not religious, so he’ll have to look for someone else if he’s looking for findings of heresy.  I did, however, want to share his announcement:
  
The American Statistical Association has announced  a new Prize , “Causality in Statistics Education”, aimed to encourage the teaching of basic causal inference in introductory statistics courses.  


The motivations for the prize are discussed in  an interview  I [Pearl] gave to Ron Wasserstein. I hope readers of this list will participate, either by innovating new tools for teaching causation or by nominating candidates who deserve the prize.

<p>Introduction: Mark Johnstone writes:
  
I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?


One proposal has been to fit ‘black boxes’ into cars so more individual data can be collected, as opposed to relying heavily on aggregates.

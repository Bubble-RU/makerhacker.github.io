<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.

<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points us to  a discussion in Statistics in Medicine  of the  famous claims  by Christakis and Fowler on the contagion of obesity etc.
 
 
 
 James O’Malley  and  Christakis and Fowler  present the positive case.
 
 Andrew Thomas  and  Tyler VanderWeele  present constructive criticism.
 
Christakis and Fowler  reply .
 
Coincidentally, a couple weeks ago an epidemiologist was explaining to me the differences between the Framingham Heart Study and the Nurses Health Study and why Framingham got the postmenopausal supplement risks right while Nurses got it wrong.
 
P.S.  The journal issue also includes a comment on “A distribution-free test of constant mean in linear mixed effects models.”  Wow!  I had no idea people still did this sort of thing.  How horrible.  But I guess that’s what half-life is all about.

<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

<p>Introduction: Somebody I know sent me a link to  this news article  by Martin Robbins describing a potential scientific breakthrough.  I express some skepticism but in a vague enough way that, in the unlikely event that the research claim turns out to be correct, there’s no paper trail showing that I was wrong.  I have some comments on the graphs–the tables are horrible, no need to even discuss them!–and I’d prefer if the authors of the paper could display their data and model on a single graph.  I realize that their results reached a standard level of statistical significance, but it’s hard for me to interpret their claims until I see their estimates on some sort of direct real-world scale.  In any case, though, I’m sure these researchers are working hard, and I wish them the best of luck in their future efforts to replicate their findings.
 
I’m sure they’ll have no problem replicating, whether or not their claims are actually true.

<p>Introduction: Continuing “heckle the press” month here at the blog, I (Bob) found the following “discovery” a little overplayed by  David H. Freedman , who was writing for  Scientific American  in the following article and blog post:
  
 Blog:  Why Economic Models are Always Wrong 
  Article:  A Formula for Economic Calamity 
   
The article’s paywalled, but the blog entry isn’t.  Apparently, a geophysicist named Jonathan Carter (good luck finding him on the web given only that information) found that when he simulated from a complicated model, then fit the model to the simulated data, he sometimes got different results.  What’s more, these differing estimates fit the data equally well but made different predictions on new data.  Now we don’t know if the model was identifiable, had different local optima (i.e., multiple modes), how he fit the data, or really anything, but it doesn’t really matter.

The authors have issued a statement that argues against some criticisms of their study that others have offered. These are irrelevant to the above observations, as I [Freese] am taking everything about the measurement and model specification at their word–my starting point is the model that fully replicates the analyses that they themselves published.


A qualification is that one of their comments is that they deny they are making any claims about the importance of other factors that kill people in hurricanes. But they are. If you claim that 27 out of the 42 deaths in Hurricane Eloise would have been prevented if it was named Hurricane Charley, that is indeed a claim that diminishes the potential importance of other causes of deaths in that hurricane.
  
Freese also raises an important general issue in science communication:

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok with a good  catch :
  
In  Why Don’t Women Patent? , a recent NBER paper, Jennifer Hunt et al. [Jean-Philippe Garant, Hannah Herman, and David Munroe] present a stark fact: Only 5.5% of the holders of commercialized patents are women. One might think that this is explained by the relative lack of women with science and engineering degrees but Hunt et al. find that “women with such a degree are scarcely more likely to patent than women without.” Instead, most of the difference is “accounted for by differences among those with a science or engineering degree” especially the fact that women are underrepresented in patent-intensive fields such as electrical and mechanical engineering and in development and design.


Predictably, the authors do not ask why women might self-selection into non patent-intensive fields, perhaps because this would require at least a discussion of  politically incorrect questions . The failure to investigate these questions leads to some dubious co</p><p>3 0.98471689 <a title="1412-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-Difficulties_with_the_1-4-power_transformation.html">1142 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-Difficulties with the 1-4-power transformation</a></p>

I am a fan of the quarter root transform ever since reading about it on your  blog .  However, today my student and I hit a wall that I’m hoping you might have some insight on.


By training, I am a psychophysicist (think SS Stevens), and people in my field often log transform data prior to analysis. However, this data frequently contains zeros, so I’ve tried using quarter root transforms to get around this. But until today, I had never tried to back transform the plot axis for readability. I assumed this would be straightforward – alas it is not.


Specifically, we quarter root transformed our data, performed an ANOVA, got what we thought was a reasonable effect, and then plotted the data. So far so good. However, the LS means in question are below 1, meaning that raising them to the 4th power just makes them smaller, and uninterpretable in the original metric.


Do you have any thoughts or insights you might share?

<p>Introduction: A few years ago I watched a bunch of Speed Racer cartoons with Phil in a movie theater in the early 90s. These were low-budget Japanese cartoons from the 60s that we loved as kids. From my adult perspective, the best parts were during the characters’ long drives, where you could see Japanese industrial scenes in the background.
 
Similarly, sometimes the most interesting aspect of a book or article is not its overt content but rather its unexamined assumptions.
 
I was reminded of this today when reading the Times this morning.  In an interesting column reviewing recent research on happiness (marred only by his decision not to interview any psychology researchers; after all, they’re the academic experts on the topic), Adam Davidson  writes :

When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days, what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game?

We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting. The answers came in between 65% and 70%.






The true answer [based on Dan's analysis of a database of baseball games]: 51.3%, a little better than a coin toss.
  
I have to say, I’m surprised his colleagues gave such extreme guesses.  I was guessing something like 50%, myself, based on the following very crude reasoning:
 
Suppose two unequal teams are playing, and the chance of team A beating team B is 55%.  (This seems like a reasonable average of all matchups, which will include some more extreme disparities but also many more equal contests.)

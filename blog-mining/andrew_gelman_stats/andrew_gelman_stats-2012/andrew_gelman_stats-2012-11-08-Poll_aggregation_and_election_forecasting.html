<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.

<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis wrote  this  useful news article on the promise and limitations of “big data.”
 
And let me add this related point:
 
Big data are typically not random samples, hence the need for “big model” to map from sample to population.   Here’s an example  (with Wei Wang, David Rothschild, and Sharad Goel): 
  
  
Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked for whom they intend to vote. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable financial and time costs. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical ben- efits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and often faster and at less expense than traditional survey methods. We demon- strate this approach</p><p>4 0.27439547 <a title="1570-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-Politics_is_not_a_random_walk%3A__Momentum_and_mean_reversion_in_polling.html">364 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-Politics is not a random walk:  Momentum and mean reversion in polling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>5 0.26997912 <a title="1570-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>6 0.26459467 <a title="1570-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-16-What_I_learned_from_those_tough_538_commenters.html">210 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-16-What I learned from those tough 538 commenters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>5 0.83954746 <a title="1570-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-Politics_is_not_a_random_walk%3A__Momentum_and_mean_reversion_in_polling.html">364 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-Politics is not a random walk:  Momentum and mean reversion in polling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, Henry  writes  about poll averaging and election forecasts.  Henry writes that “These models need to crunch lots of polls, at the state and national level, if they’re going to provide good predictions.” Actually, you can get reasonable predictions from national-level forecasting models plus previous state-level election results, then when the election comes closer you can use national and state polls as needed. See my paper with Kari Lock,  Bayesian combination of state polls and election forecasts .  (That said, the method in that paper is fairly complicated, much more so than simply taking weighted averages of state polls, if such abundant data happen to be available.  And I’m sure our approach would need to be altered if it were used for real-time forecasts.)
 
Having a steady supply of polls of varying quality from various sources allows poll aggregators to produce  news  every day (in the sense of pushing their estimates around) but it doesn’t help much with a</p><p>2 0.96250784 <a title="1570-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-A_note_to_John.html">131 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-A note to John</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff the Productivity Sapper points me to  this insulting open letter to Nate Silver  written by pollster John Zogby.  I’ll go through bits of Zogby’s note line by line.  (Conflict of interest warning:  I have collaborated with Nate and I blog on his site).
  
Zogby writes:  Here is some advice from someone [Zogby] who has been where you [Silver] are today.
  
Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.
  
Zogby writes:  You [Nate] are hot right now – using an aggregate of other people’s work, you got 49 of 50 states right in 2008.
  
Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.

I am a student of economics and recently read  your review  of Mostly Harmless Econometrics. In the review you mention that the book contains no time series. Given that your book on data analysis (Data Analysis using Regression) does not contain any time series material either, I wonder if you happen to have any favourite time series reference similar in style/level to the data analysis book.
  
I don’t know.  The closest thing might be Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand, but I don’t know of anything focused on time series that’s quite in the format that I’d prefer. This is not my area, though.

<p>Introduction: People keep asking me what I think of Nate’s book, and I keep replying that, as a blogger, I’m spoiled.  I’m so used to getting books for free that I wouldn’t go out and buy a book just for the purpose of reviewing it.  (That reminds me that I should post reviews of some of those books I’ve received in the mail over the past few months.)
 
I have, however, encountered a couple of reviews of The Signal and the Noise so I thought I’d pass them on to you.  Both these reviews are by statisticians / data scientists who work here in NYC in the non-academic “real world” so in that sense they are perhaps better situated than me to review the book (also, they have not collaborated with Nate so they have no conflict of interest).
 
Kaiser Fung gives a  positive review :
  
It is in the subtitle—“why so many predictions fail – but some don’t”—that one learns the core philosophy of Silver: he is most concerned with the honest evaluation of the performance of predictive models.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Robinson writes:
  
I’m a survey researcher who mostly does political work, but I also have a strong interest in economics.  I have a question about this graph you commonly see in the economics literature. It is of a concept called the Beveridge Curve [recently in the newspaper  here ]. It is one of the more interesting concepts in labor economics, relating the vacancy rate in jobs to the unemployment rate. A  good primer is  here .


However, despite being one of the more interesting concepts in economics, the way it is displayed visually is nothing short of atrocious:


 


These graphs are nothing short of unreadable and pretty much the standard (Brad Delong has linked to this graph above and it can appear like this in publication as well). I’ve only really seen one representation of the curve that is more clear than this and it is at  this link :

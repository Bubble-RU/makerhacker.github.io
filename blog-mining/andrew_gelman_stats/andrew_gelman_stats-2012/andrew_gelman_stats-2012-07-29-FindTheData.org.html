Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

Greetings, 
My name is Bryan Clark, and I’m a big fan of your writing. I contacted you because I think I have a mutually beneficial agreement that will allow you to make additional money for articles you are already writing online. Let me give you an idea of how we can help each other. 
We’re looking for writers that can help increase the profile of our clients by linking to them within the context of their articles. The clients are huge, and we generally have one that can fit naturally in the context of most article niches. 
In return, we pay generously for a single link for our clients. 
If you are interested, I’d love to talk about it more.

Bryan Clark

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reported  on someone who wanted to insert text links into the blog.  I asked her how much they would pay and got no answer.
 
Yesterday, though, I received this reply:
  
Hello Andrew,


I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I’d like to make a proposal for your site. Please refer below.


We would like to place a simple text link ad on page http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/  to link to *** with the key phrase ***.


We will incorporate the key phrase into a sentence so it would read well. Rest assured it won’t sound obnoxious or advertorial. We will then process the final text link code as soon as you agree to our proposal. 


We can offer you $200 for this with the assumption that you will keep the link “live” on that page for 12 months or longer if you prefer.


Please get back to us with a quick reply on your thoughts on this and include your Paypal ID for payment process.  Hoping for a positive response from you.

Howdy Andrew,


Hope you’re keeping well! I was wondering if you’re open to guest posts at Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science – if you are interested, I can offer an original 500-1000 word, very high quality article in fitting with the site. All research and writing will be carried out by a professional writer (namely, me) and once approved it will be entirely yours to place on the site as you see fit.


I can choose a title for the article or you can suggest one and I’ll work around that. Normally I write for property and travel sites (particularly cruise and ski related), but I’m game for anything if you’re happy to entertain me. I can also include some copyright-free and high quality pictures related to the blog post.


You’re probably wondering what’s in it for me, which is a fair question – in return, all I’d ask is a subtle link back in return. Other than that, the material itself would be non-commericial</p><p>6 0.074988842 <a title="1434-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-24-Latest_in_blog_advertising.html">1080 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-24-Latest in blog advertising</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How am I supposed to handle this sort of thing?  (See below.)  I just stuck it one of my email folders without responding, but then I wondered . . . what’s it all about?  Is there some sort of Glengarry Glen Ross-like parallel world where down-on-their-luck Jack Lemmons of public relations world send out electronic cold calls?  More than anything else, this sort of thing makes me glad I have a steady job.
 
Here’s the (unsolicited) email, which came with the subject line “Please help a reporter do his job”:
  
Dear Andrew,


As an Editor for the Bulldog Reporter (www.bulldogreporter.com/dailydog), a media relations trade publication, my job is to help ensure that my readers have accurate info about you and send you the best quality pitches. By taking five minutes or less to answer my questions (pasted below), you’ll receive targeted PR pitches from our client base that will match your beat and interests.

Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.

<p>Introduction: I received the following email, subject line “Want to Buy Text Link from andrewgelman.com”: 
  
  
Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got.

Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.

<p>Introduction: 2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.
 
(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.
 
(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.
 
(d) With a small sample size, you cannot hope to learn anything conclusive, but you can get a crude estimate of effect size and standard deviation which will be useful in a power analysis to help you decide how large your full study needs to be.
 
(e) You can talk with survey respondents and get a sense of how they perceived your questions.
 
(f) You get a chance to learn about practical difficulties with sampling, nonresponse, and question wording.
 
(g) You can check if your sample is approximately representative of your population.

<p>Introduction: Joan Garfield, a leading researcher in statistics education, is conducting a survey of graduate students who teach or assist with the teaching of statistics.  She writes: 
  
  
We want to invite them to take a short survey that will enable us to collect some baseline data that we may use in a grant proposal we are developing.  The project would provide summer workshops and ongoing support for graduate students who will be teaching or assisting with teaching introductory statistics classes. If the grant is funded, we would invite up to 40 students from around the country who are entering graduate programs in statistics to participate in a three-year training and support program.  The goal of this program is to help these students become expert and flexible teachers of statistics, and to support them as they move through their teaching experiences as graduate students.
  
Here’s the  the online survey .  Garfield writes, “Your responses are completely voluntary and anonymous.

<p>Introduction: I don’t have much sympathy for well-paid academic plagiarists who are too lazy to do their jobs, but I actually can feel for the author in  this story  who posted fake positive Amazon reviews of his own books and negative reviews of his competitors’.
 
I mean, sure, this is despicable behavior, I won’t deny that, but it’s gotta be harder and harder to make money writing books.  Even a so-called bestselling author must feel under a lot of pressure.  I was recently reading a book by Jonathan Coe—he’s just great, and famous, and celebrated, but I doubt he’s getting rich from his books.  Not that there’s any reason that he has to get rich, but if even  Jonathan Coe  isn’t living the high life, that’s not good for authors in general.  It’s a far cry from the days in which Updike, Styron, etc., could swagger around like bigshots.</p><p>6 0.99800986 <a title="1434-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-01-Literature_and_life.html">174 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-01-Literature and life</a></p>

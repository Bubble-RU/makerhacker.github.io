<p>Introduction: Michael McLaughlin sent me the following query with the above title.
  
Some time ago, I [McLaughlin] was handed a dataset that needed to be modeled.  It was generated as follows:


1. Random navigation errors, historically a binary mixture of normal and Laplace with a common mean, were collected by observation.


2. Sadly, these data were recorded with too few decimal places so that the resulting quantization is clearly visible in a scatterplot.


3. The quantized data were then interpolated (to an unobserved location).


The final result looks like fuzzy points (small scale jitter) at quantized intervals spanning a much larger scale (the parent mixture distribution).  This fuzziness, likely ~normal or ~Laplace, results from the interpolation.  Otherwise, the data would look like a discrete analogue of the normal/Laplace mixture.


I would like to characterize the latent normal/Laplace mixture distribution but the quantization is “getting in the way”.  When I tried MCMC on this proble</p><p>3 0.19373715 <a title="1459-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-18-Should_we_always_be_using_the_t_and_robit_instead_of_the_normal_and_logit%3F.html">773 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-18-Should we always be using the t and robit instead of the normal and logit?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My (coauthored) books on Bayesian data analysis and applied regression are like almost all the other statistics textbooks out there, in that we spend most of our time on the basic distributions such as normal and logistic and then, only as an aside, discuss robust models such as t and robit.
 
Why aren’t the t and robit front and center?  Sure, I can see starting with the normal (at least in the Bayesian book, where we actually work out all the algebra), but then why don’t we move on immediately to the real stuff?
 
This isn’t just (or mainly) a question of textbooks or teaching; I’m really thinking here about statistical practice.  My statistical practice.  Should t and robit be the default?  If not, why not?
 
Some possible answers:
  
10.  Estimating the degrees of freedom in the error distribution isn’t so easy, and throwing this extra parameter into the model could make inference unstable.


9.  Real data usually don’t have outliers.  In practice, fitting a robust model costs you</p><p>4 0.17270313 <a title="1459-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-28-The_holes_in_my_philosophy_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">781 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-28-The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10. Inference about μ is straightforward, as is model checking, whether based on graphs or numerical summaries such as the sample variance and skewn</p><p>5 0.16982818 <a title="1459-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-19-Transformations_for_non-normal_data.html">2176 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-19-Transformations for non-normal data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Peterson writes:
  
I recently submitted a proposal on applying a Bayesian analysis to gender comparisons on motivational constructs. I had an idea on how to improve the model I used and was hoping you could give me some feedback.


The data come from a survey based on 5-point Likert scales. Different constructs are measured for each student as scores derived from averaging a student’s responses on particular subsets of survey questions. (I suppose it is not uncontroversial to treat these scores as interval measures and would be interested to hear if you have any objections.) I am comparing genders on each construct. Researchers typically use t-tests to do so.


To use a Bayesian approach I applied the programs written in R and JAGS by John Kruschke for estimating the difference of means:

<p>Introduction: David Hogg writes:
  
My (now deceased) collaborator and guru in all things inference, Sam Roweis, used to emphasize to me that we should evaluate models in the data space — not the parameter space — because models are always effectively “effective” and not really, fundamentally true. Or, in other words, models should be compared in the space of their predictions, not in the space of their parameters (the  parameters didn’t really “exist” at all for Sam).  In that spirit, when we estimate the effectiveness of a MCMC method or tuning — by autocorrelation time or ESJD or anything else — shouldn’t we be looking at the changes in the model predictions over time, rather than the changes in the parameters over time?  That is, the autocorrelation time should be the autocorrelation time in what the model (at the walker position) predicts for the data, and the ESJD should be the expected squared jump distance in what the model predicts for the data?

Do you have suggestions as to model selection strategies akin to Bayesian model averaging for multilevel models when level-2 inputs are of substantive interest? I [Causey] have seen plenty of R packages and procedures for non-multilevel models, and tried the glmulti package but found that it did not perform well with more than a few level-2 variables.
  
My quick answer is:  with a name like that, you should really be fitting three-level models!
 
My longer answer is:  regular readers will be unsurprised to hear that I’m no fan of  Bayesian model averaging .  Instead I’d prefer to bite the bullet and assign an informative prior distribution on these coefficients.  I don’t have a great example of such an analysis but I’m more and more thinking that this is the way to go.  I don’t see the point in aiming for the intermediate goal of pruning the predictors; I’d rather have a procedure that includes prior information on the predictors and their interactions.</p><p>4 0.85349488 <a title="1459-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-27-Bayesian_model_averaging_or_fitting_a_larger_model.html">1999 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-27-Bayesian model averaging or fitting a larger model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Firoozye writes:
  
I had a question about BMA [Bayesian model averaging] and model combinations in general, and direct it to you since they are a basic form of hierarchical model, albeit in the simplest of forms. I wanted to ask what the underlying assumptions are that could lead to BMA improving on a larger model. 


I know model combination is a topic of interest in the (frequentist) econometrics community (e.g., Bates & Granger, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3008764?uid=3738032&uid;=2&uid;=4&sid;=21101948653381) but at the time it was considered a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps small models combined outperform a big model due to standard errors, insufficient data, etc. But I haven’t seen much in way of Bayesian justification.


In simplest terms, you might have a joint density P(Y,theta_1,theta_2) from which you could use the two marginals P(Y,theta_1) and P(Y,theta_2) to derive two separate forecasts. A BMA-er would do a weighted average of the two forecast densities, having p</p><p>5 0.84744078 <a title="1459-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-18-Should_we_always_be_using_the_t_and_robit_instead_of_the_normal_and_logit%3F.html">773 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-18-Should we always be using the t and robit instead of the normal and logit?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My (coauthored) books on Bayesian data analysis and applied regression are like almost all the other statistics textbooks out there, in that we spend most of our time on the basic distributions such as normal and logistic and then, only as an aside, discuss robust models such as t and robit.
 
Why aren’t the t and robit front and center?  Sure, I can see starting with the normal (at least in the Bayesian book, where we actually work out all the algebra), but then why don’t we move on immediately to the real stuff?
 
This isn’t just (or mainly) a question of textbooks or teaching; I’m really thinking here about statistical practice.  My statistical practice.  Should t and robit be the default?  If not, why not?
 
Some possible answers:
  
10.  Estimating the degrees of freedom in the error distribution isn’t so easy, and throwing this extra parameter into the model could make inference unstable.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

<p>Introduction: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data :
  
We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation</p><p>4 0.97654879 <a title="1459-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman  refers  to finite mixture models as “beasts” and  writes  jokes that they “should be avoided at all costs.”
 
I’ve thought a lot about mixture models, ever since using them in an  analysis  of voting patterns that was published in 1990.  First off, I’d like to say that our model was useful so I’d prefer not to pay the cost of avoiding it.  For a quick description of our mixture model and its context, see pp. 379-380 of my  article  in the Jim Berger volume).  Actually, our case was particularly difficult because we were not even fitting a mixture model to data, we were fitting it to latent data and using the model to perform partial pooling.  My difficulties in trying to fit this model inspired our discussion of mixture models in Bayesian Data Analysis (page 109 in the second edition, in the section on “Counterexamples to the theorems”).
 
I agree with Larry that if you’re fitting a mixture model, it’s good to be aware of the problems that arise if you try to estimate</p><p>6 0.97546178 <a title="1459-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-A_defense_of_Tom_Wolfe_based_on_the_impossibility_of_the_law_of_small_numbers_in_network_structure.html">1615 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-A defense of Tom Wolfe based on the impossibility of the law of small numbers in network structure</a></p>

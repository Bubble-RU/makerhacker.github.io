<p>Introduction: Bayesian inference, conditional on the model and data, conforms to the likelihood principle. But there is more to Bayesian methods than Bayesian inference. See chapters 6 and 7 of Bayesian Data Analysis for much discussion of this point.

<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>5 0.26371762 <a title="1205-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-28-The_holes_in_my_philosophy_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">781 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-28-The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10.

<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.  It’s just that he’s fighting against a bu</p><p>4 0.92408204 <a title="1205-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-11-Why_waste_time_philosophizing%3F.html">1719 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-11-Why waste time philosophizing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll answer the above question after first sharing some background and history on the the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, which appeared at the end of our  rejoinder  to the discussion to which I  linked  the other day:
  
When we were beginning our statistical educations, the word ‘Bayesian’ conveyed membership in an obscure cult. Statisticians who were outside the charmed circle could ignore the Bayesian subfield, while Bayesians themselves tended to be either apologetic or brazenly defiant. These two extremes manifested themselves in ever more elaborate proposals for non-informative priors, on the one hand, and declarations of the purity of subjective probability, on the other.


Much has changed in the past 30 years. ‘Bayesian’ is now often used in casual scientific parlance as a synonym for ‘rational’, the anti-Bayesians have mostly disappeared, and non-Bayesian statisticians feel the need to keep up with developments in Bayesian modelling and computation. Bayesians themselves</p><p>5 0.92032117 <a title="1205-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-31-What_is_a_Bayesian%3F.html">1438 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-31-What is a Bayesian?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo recommended that I consider coming up with a new name for the statistical methods that I used, given that the term “Bayesian” has all sorts of associations that I dislike (as discussed, for example, in section 1 of  this article ).
 
I replied that I agree on Bayesian, I never liked the term and always wanted something better, but I couldn’t think of any convenient alternative.  Also, I was finding that Bayesians (even the Bayesians I disagreed with) were reading my research articles, while non-Bayesians were simply ignoring them.  So I thought it was best to identify with, and communicate with, those people who were willing to engage with me.
 
More formally, I’m happy defining “Bayesian” as “using inference from the posterior distribution, p(theta|y)”.  This says nothing about where the probability distributions come from (thus, no requirement to be “subjective” or “objective”) and it says nothing about the models (thus, no requirement to use the discrete models that hav</p><p>6 0.91957611 <a title="1205-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In an ideal world, research articles would be open to criticism and discussion in the same place where they are published, in a sort of non-corrupt version of Yelp.  What is happening now is that the occasional paper or research area gets lots of press coverage, and this inspires reactions on science-focused blogs.  The trouble here is that it’s easier to give off-the-cuff comments than detailed criticisms.
 
Here’s an example.  It starts a couple years ago with  this article  by Ryota Kanai, Tom Feilden, Colin Firth, and Geraint Rees, on brain size and political orientation:
  
In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>3 0.968238 <a title="1205-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-30-Infill_asymptotics_and_sprawl_asymptotics.html">1877 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-30-Infill asymptotics and sprawl asymptotics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Anirban Bhattacharya, Debdeep Pati, Natesh Pillai, and David Dunson  write :
  
Penalized regression methods, such as L1 regularization, are routinely used in high-dimensional applications, and there is a rich literature on optimality properties under sparsity assumptions. In the Bayesian paradigm, sparsity is routinely induced through two-component mixture priors having a probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunting computational problems in high dimensions. This has motivated an amazing variety of continuous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale mixtures of Gaussians, facilitating computation. In sharp contrast to the corresponding frequentist literature, very little is known about the properties of such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide precise results on prior and posterior concentration. Interestingly, we demonstrate that most commonly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian Lasso, are suboptimal in hig</p><p>4 0.96792507 <a title="1205-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-22-Likelihood_Ratio_%E2%89%A0_1_Journal.html">1774 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-22-Likelihood Ratio ≠ 1 Journal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan  writes :
  
The basic idea . . . is to promote identification of study designs that scholars who disagree about a proposition would agree would generate evidence relevant to their competing conjectures—regardless of what studies based on such designs actually find. Articles proposing designs of this sort would be selected for publication and only then be carried out, by the proposing researchers with funding from the journal, which would publish the results too.


Now I [Kahan] am aware of a set of real journals that have a similar motivation.


One is the  Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, which as its title implies publishes papers reporting studies that fail to “reject” the null. Like JASNH, LR ≠1J would try to offset the “file drawer” bias and like bad consequences associated with the convention of publishing only findings that are “significant at p < 0.05."


But it would try to do more.

“Core-collapse supernovae, the luminous explosions of massive stars, exhibit an expansive and meaningful diversity of behavior in their brightness evolution over time (their “light curves”). Our group discovers and monitors these events using the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii, and we’ve collected a dataset of about 20,000 individual photometric observations of about 80 Type IIP supernovae, the class my work has focused on. While this dataset provides one of the best available tools to infer the explosion properties of these supernovae, due to the nature of extragalactic astronomy (observing from distances

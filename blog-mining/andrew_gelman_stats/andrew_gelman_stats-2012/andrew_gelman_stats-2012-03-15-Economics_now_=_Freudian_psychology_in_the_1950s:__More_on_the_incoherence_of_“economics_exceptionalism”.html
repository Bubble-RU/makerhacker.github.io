<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.

<p>Introduction: Joseph Delaney  writes :
  
Is it fair to quote the definition of economics from the blurb for a book?  If so, consider this definition in the blurb for Emily Oster’s new book:

 
When Oster was expecting her first child, she felt powerless to make the right decisions for her pregnancy. How doctors think and what patients need are two very different things. So Oster drew on her own experience and went in search of the real facts about pregnancy using an economist’s tools. Economics is not just a study of finance. It’s the science of determining value and making informed decisions. To make a good decision, you need to understand the information available to you and to know what it means to you as an individual.
 

So, when applied to a medical topic (like pregnancy) how does this differ from evidence based medicine?  Should I be calling myself an economist? 


None of this mean that Emily shouldn’t write this book. My own read on the alcohol and pregnancy angle is that the current advic</p><p>4 0.16015059 <a title="1213-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-11-Yes%2C_the_decision_to_try_%28or_not%29_to_have_a_child_can_be_made_rationally.html">1758 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-11-Yes, the decision to try (or not) to have a child can be made rationally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>5 0.15815394 <a title="1213-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-15-How_effective_are_football_coaches%3F.html">1804 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-15-How effective are football coaches?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>6 0.15481123 <a title="1213-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-03-%E2%80%9CRationality%E2%80%9D_reinforces%2C_does_not_compete_with%2C_other_models_of_behavior.html">692 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-03-“Rationality” reinforces, does not compete with, other models of behavior</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joseph Delaney  writes :
  
Is it fair to quote the definition of economics from the blurb for a book?  If so, consider this definition in the blurb for Emily Oster’s new book:

 
When Oster was expecting her first child, she felt powerless to make the right decisions for her pregnancy. How doctors think and what patients need are two very different things. So Oster drew on her own experience and went in search of the real facts about pregnancy using an economist’s tools. Economics is not just a study of finance. It’s the science of determining value and making informed decisions. To make a good decision, you need to understand the information available to you and to know what it means to you as an individual.
 

So, when applied to a medical topic (like pregnancy) how does this differ from evidence based medicine?  Should I be calling myself an economist? 


None of this mean that Emily shouldn’t write this book. My own read on the alcohol and pregnancy angle is that the current advic</p><p>5 0.79637837 <a title="1213-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-15-How_effective_are_football_coaches%3F.html">1804 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-15-How effective are football coaches?</a></p>

A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>6 0.7959134 <a title="1213-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>

<p>Introduction: New Year’s Day is an excellent time to look back at changes, not just in the past year, but in the past half-century.
 
Mark Palko has an interesting  post  on the pace of changes in everyday life.  We’ve been hearing a lot in the past few decades about how things are changing faster and faster.  But, as Palko points out, the difference between life in 1962 and life today does not seem so different, at least for many people in the United States.  Sure, there are some big changes:  nonwhites get more respect, people mostly live longer, many cancers can be cured, fewer people are really really poor but it’s harder to hold down a job, cars are more reliable, you can get fresh fish in the suburbs, containers are lighter and stronger, vacations in the Caribbean instead of the Catskills, people have a lot more stuff and a lot more place to put it, etc etc etc.  But life in the 1950s or 1960s just doesn’t seem so different from how we live today.

My reply:  Any number of respondents should work.  If you have very few respondents, you should just end up with large standard errors which will propagate through your analysis.

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  reports :
  
In a typical study, half of the targets are gay/lesbian and half are straight, so a purely random guesser (i.e., someone with no gaydar) would be around 50%. The reported accuracy rates in the articles . . . say that people guess correctly about 65% of the time. . . . Let’s assume that the 65% accuracy rate is symmetric — that guessers are just as good at correctly identifying gays/lesbians as they are in identifying straight people. Let’s also assume that 5% of people are actually gay/lesbian. From those numbers, a quick calculation tells us that for a randomly-selected member of the population, if your gaydar says “GAY” there is a 9% chance that you are right. Eerily accurate? Not so much. If you rely too much on your gaydar, you are going to make a lot of dumb mistakes. . . .
  
It’s the classic problem of combining direct evidence with base rates.</p><p>4 0.97564381 <a title="1213-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-The_most_dangerous_jobs_in_America.html">1086 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-The most dangerous jobs in America</a></p>

On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>5 0.974208 <a title="1213-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-16-Update_on_the_generalized_method_of_moments.html">519 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-16-Update on the generalized method of moments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading all the comments  here  I remembered that I’ve actually written  a paper  on the generalized method of moments–including the bit about maximum likelihood being a special case.  The basic idea is simple enough that it must have been rediscovered dozens of times by different people (sort of like the  trapezoidal rule ).
 
In our case, we were motivated to (independently) develop the (well-known, but not by me) generalized method of moments as a way of specifying an indirectly-parameterized prior distribution, rather than as a way of estimating parameters from direct data.  But the math is the same.</p><p>6 0.97379053 <a title="1213-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-11-Yes%2C_the_decision_to_try_%28or_not%29_to_have_a_child_can_be_made_rationally.html">1758 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-11-Yes, the decision to try (or not) to have a child can be made rationally</a></p>

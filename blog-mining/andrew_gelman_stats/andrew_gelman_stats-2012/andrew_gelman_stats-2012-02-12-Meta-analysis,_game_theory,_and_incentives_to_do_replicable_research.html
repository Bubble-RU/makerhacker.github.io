<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>3 0.11848602 <a title="1163-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-26-Suggested_resolution_of_the_Bem_paradox.html">1139 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-26-Suggested resolution of the Bem paradox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>4 0.11116549 <a title="1163-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-17-Replication_backlash.html">2137 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-17-Replication backlash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Raghuveer Parthasarathy pointed me to an article in Nature by Mina Bissell, who  writes , “The push to replicate findings could shelve promising research and unfairly damage the reputations of careful, meticulous scientists.”
 
I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>6 0.11046904 <a title="1163-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a killer story  (from Brian Nosek, Jeffrey Spies, and Matt Motyl).
 
Part 1:
  
Two of the present authors, Motyl and Nosek, share interests in political ideology. We were inspired by the fast growing literature on embodiment that demonstrates surprising links between body and mind (Markman & Brendl, 2005; Proffitt, 2006) to investigate embodiment of political extremism. Participants from the political left, right and center (N = 1,979) completed a perceptual judgment task in which words were presented in different shades of gray. Participants had to click along a gradient representing grays from near black to near white to select a shade that matched the shade of the word. We calculated accuracy: How close to the actual shade did participants get? The results were stunning. Moderates perceived the shades of gray more accurately than extremists on the left and right (p = .01). Our conclusion: political extremists perceive the world in black-and-white, figuratively and literally</p><p>3 0.80203575 <a title="1163-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-13-Preregistration_of_Studies_and_Mock_Reports.html">1671 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-13-Preregistration of Studies and Mock Reports</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The traditional system of scientific and scholarly publishing is breaking down in two different directions.
 
On one hand, we are moving away from relying on a small set of journals as gatekeepers: the number of papers and research projects is increasing, the number of publication outlets is increasing, and important manuscripts are being posted on SSRN, Arxiv, and other nonrefereed sites.
 
At the same time, many researchers are worried about the profusion of published claims that turn out to not replicate or in plain language, to be false. This concern is not new–some prominent discussions include Rosenthal (1979), Ioannidis (2005), and Vul et al. (2009)–but there is a growing sense that the scientific signal is being swamped by noise.
 
I recently had the opportunity to comment in the journal Political Analysis on two papers, one by Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt, and one by Monogan, on the preregistration of studies and mock reports.   Here’s  the issue of the journal.

<p>Introduction: There is live debate that will available this week for those that might be interested.  The topic:  Can early stopped trials result in misleading results of systematic reviews?
  

 
It’s sponsored by the Cochrane Collaboration and although the level of discussion is often not very technical, it does in my opinion provide a nice window into clinical research and as Tukey might put it “the real uncertainties involved”. 
 
(As a disclaimer – I once assigned some reading from this group to my graduate students and they were embarrassed and annoyed at the awkward handling of even minor technical issues – but the statistical research community is not their target audience.)
 
I have a favourite in this debate, and a quick search on co-authors (not me) would likely tip that off to most members of this blog. 
 
Here’s the directions kindly supplied by Jonathan Sterne, who will be in the chair.

<p>Introduction: A link from the comments here took me to the wonderfully named  Barfblog  and a report by Don Schaffner on some reporting.
 
 First, the background:   A university in England issued a press release saying that “Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria than if it is left for longer periods of time . . . The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the ‘5 second rule’  – the urban myth about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped.”  According to the press release, the study was “undertaken by final year Biology students” and led by a professor of microbiology.
 
The press release hit the big time, hitting NPR, Slate, Forbes, the Daily News, etc etc.  Some typical headlines:

<p>Introduction: One of the key insights of game theory is to solve problems in reverse time order.  You first figure out what you would do in the endgame, then decide a middle-game strategy to get you where you want to be at the end, then you choose an opening that will take you on your desired path.  All conditional on what the other players do in their turn.
 
In an  article  from 1989, “Meta-analysis in medical research:  Strong encouragement for higher quality in individual research efforts,” Keith O’Rourke and Allan Detsky apply this principle to the process of publication of scientific research: 
  
  
From the statistical point of view, there really is no escape from performing a de facto meta-analysis. One can either judge the effectiveness of a therapy based solely on the most recent study and ignore all previous studies, a method which is equivalent to giving the most recent study weight 1.Oand all previous studies weight 0, or try to choose the weights on some scientific basis . . .

<p>Introduction: My article with Daniel and Yair  has recently appeared in The Forum:
  
We use multilevel modeling to estimate support for health-care reform by age, income, and state. Opposition to reform is concentrated among higher-income voters and those over 65. Attitudes do not vary much by state. Unfortunately, our poll data only go to 2004, but we suspect that much can be learned from the relative positions of different demographic groups and different states, despite swings in national opinion. We speculate on the political implications of these findings.
  
The article features some pretty graphs that originally appeared on the blog.
 
It’s in a special issue on health care politics that has several interesting articles, among which I’d like to single out  this one  by Bob Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs entitled, “Simulating Representation: Elite Mobilization and Political Power in Health Care Reform”:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>4 0.94625485 <a title="1163-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-20-More_on_why_%E2%80%9Call_politics_is_local%E2%80%9D_is_an_outdated_slogan.html">478 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-20-More on why “all politics is local” is an outdated slogan</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  wrote  that Mickey Kaus was right to point out that it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.” As Kaus points out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.  The slogan is particularly silly for Tip O’Neill himself.  Sure, O’Neill had to have a firm grip on local politics to get his safe seat in the first place, but after that it was smooth sailing.
 
Jonathan Bernstein  disagrees , writing:
  
 
Yes, but: don’t most Members of the House have ironclad partisan districts?  And isn’t the most important single thing they can do to protect themselves involve having pull in state politics to avoid being gerrymandered?  That is “all politics is local,” no? 


There’s also a fair amount they can do to stay on the good side of their local party, thus avoiding a primary fight.  And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>5 0.94424486 <a title="1163-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>6 0.94407338 <a title="1163-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-05-Update_on_state_size_and_governors%E2%80%99_popularity.html">187 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-05-Update on state size and governors’ popularity</a></p>

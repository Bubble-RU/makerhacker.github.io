<p>Introduction: Try  this link . . . .
 
OK, it worked (as well as might be expected given that we don’t have any professional audiovisual people involved).  Tomorrow 8h30, I’ll post a new link with the new G+ hangout.  We’ll be going through the first two sets of slides (class1a.pdf and class1b.pdf) following the link for the slides  here .</p><p>3 0.15860257 <a title="1138-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Jelte_Wicherts_lays_down_the_stats_on_IQ.html">6 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Jelte Wicherts lays down the stats on IQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: See if you can interpolate the talk from the  slides .
 
The background is:  I was invited to speak in this seminar on “big data.”  I said I didn’t know anything about big data, I worked on little data.  They said that was ok.  Actually it was probably a crowd-pleasing move to tell these people that little-data ideas remain relevant.</p><p>5 0.12533051 <a title="1138-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-02-My_course_this_fall_on_l%E2%80%99analyse_bay%C3%A9sienne_de_donn%C3%A9es.html">1965 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-02-My course this fall on l’analyse bayésienne de données</a></p>
<p>Introduction: X marks the  spot .  I’ll post the slides soon (not just for the students in my class; these should be helpful for anyone teaching Bayesian data analysis from  our book ).  But I don’t think you’ll get much from reading the slides alone; you’ll get more out of the book (or, of course, from taking the class).</p><p>6 0.12483335 <a title="1138-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-31-Social_scientists_who_use_medical_analogies_to_explain_causal_inference_are%2C_I_think%2C_implicitly_trying_to_borrow_some_of_the_scientific_and_cultural_authority_of_that_field_for_our_own_purposes.html">1555 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-31-Social scientists who use medical analogies to explain causal inference are, I think, implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Don Coffin writes:
  
A colleague of mine and I are doing a presentation for new faculty on a number of topics related to teaching.  Our charge is to identify interesting issues and to find research-based information for them about how to approach things.  So, what I wondered is, do you know of any published research dealing with the sort of issues about structuring a course and final exam in the ways you talk about in  this blog post ?  Some poking around in the usual places hasn’t turned anything up yet.
  
I don’t really know the psychometrics literature but I imagine that some good stuff has been written on principles of test design. There are probably some good papers from back in the 1920s.  Can anyone supply some references?</p><p>3 0.69059682 <a title="1138-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-%E2%80%9CVenetia_Orcutt%2C_GWU_med_school_professor%2C_quits_after_complaints_of_no-show_class%E2%80%9D.html">1002 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-“Venetia Orcutt, GWU med school professor, quits after complaints of no-show class”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: She was  assigned to teach a class in “evidence-based medicine”!  ( link  from my usual news source).
 
I wonder what was in the syllabus?  If anyone has a copy, feel free to send to me and I will post it here.
 
My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.
  
Talk about obedience to authority!  They’re studying in a program that offers nonexistent courses, but then they follow the department’s gag order.</p><p>4 0.66787344 <a title="1138-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!
 
Conflict of interest disclaimer:  I was paid by Google last year to give a short course.</p><p>5 0.65399235 <a title="1138-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-18-A_course_in_sample_surveys_for_political_science.html">2175 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-18-A course in sample surveys for political science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague asked if I had any material for a course in sample surveys.  And indeed I do.   See here .
 
It’s all the slides for a 14-week course, also the syllabus (“surveyscourse.pdf”), the final exam (“final2012.pdf”) and various misc files. Also more discussion of final exam questions  here  (keep scrolling thru the “previous entries” until you get to Question 1).
 
Enjoy!  This is in no way a self-contained teach-it-yourself course, but I do think it could be helpful for anyone who is trying to teach a class on this material.</p><p>6 0.6495294 <a title="1138-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-25-See_me_talk_in_the_Upper_West_Side_%28without_graphs%29_today.html">821 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-25-See me talk in the Upper West Side (without graphs) today</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Chris Schmid is a statistician at New England Medical Center who is an expert on evidence-based medicine.  I invited him to present an introductory overview lecture on the topic at last year’s Joint Statistical Meetings, and  here are his slides .  All 123 of them.  I don’t know how he expected to go though all of these in an hour.  You could teach a semester-long course based on this material.
 
Good stuff, I recommend you all read it.</p><p>2 0.96227795 <a title="1138-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-18-The_estimated_effect_size_is_implausibly_large.__Under_what_models_is_this_a_piece_of_evidence_that_the_true_effect_is_small%3F.html">808 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-18-The estimated effect size is implausibly large.

<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this? I think i</p><p>3 0.96189725 <a title="1138-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-25-Good_introductory_book_for_statistical_computation%3F.html">590 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-25-Good introductory book for statistical computation?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geen Tomko asks:
  
Can you recommend a good introductory book for statistical computation? Mostly, something that would help make it easier in collecting and analyzing data from student test scores.
  
I don’t know.  Usually, when people ask for a starter statistics book, my recommendation (beyond my own books) is The Statistical Sleuth.  But that’s not really a computation book.  ARM isn’t really a statistical computation book either.  But the statistical computation books that I’ve seen don’t seems so relevant for the analyses that Tomko is looking for.  For example, the R book of Venables and Ripley focuses on nonparametric statistics, which is fine but seems a bit esoteric for these purposes.
 
Does anyone have any suggestions?</p><p>4 0.96032488 <a title="1138-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-23-In_which_I_disagree_with_John_Maynard_Keynes.html">1775 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-23-In which I disagree with John Maynard Keynes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his  review  in 1938 of  Historical Development of the Graphical Representation of Statistical Data , by H. Gray Funkhauser, for  The Economic Journal , the great economist writes:
  
Perhaps the most striking outcome of Mr. Funkhouser’s researches is the fact of the very slow progress which graphical methods made until quite recently. . . . In the first fifty volumes of the Statistical Journal, 1837-87, only fourteen graphs are printed altogether. It is surprising to be told that Laplace never drew a graph of the normal law of error . . . Edgeworth made no use of statistical charts as distinct from mathematical diagrams.


Apart from Quetelet and Jevons, the most important influences were probably those of Galton and of Mulhall’s Dictionary, first published in 1884. Galton was indeed following his father and grandfather in this field, but his pioneer work was mainly restricted to meteorological maps, and he did not contribute to the development of the graphical representation of ec</p><p>5 0.95739609 <a title="1138-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>6 0.95668143 <a title="1138-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-%E2%80%9CTexting_bans_don%E2%80%99t_reduce_crashes%3B_effects_are_slight_crash_increases%E2%80%9D.html">307 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-“Texting bans don’t reduce crashes; effects are slight crash increases”</a></p>

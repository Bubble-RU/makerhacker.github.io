<p>Introduction: This is a killer story  (from Brian Nosek, Jeffrey Spies, and Matt Motyl).
 
Part 1:
  
Two of the present authors, Motyl and Nosek, share interests in political ideology. We were inspired by the fast growing literature on embodiment that demonstrates surprising links between body and mind (Markman & Brendl, 2005; Proffitt, 2006) to investigate embodiment of political extremism. Participants from the political left, right and center (N = 1,979) completed a perceptual judgment task in which words were presented in different shades of gray. Participants had to click along a gradient representing grays from near black to near white to select a shade that matched the shade of the word. We calculated accuracy: How close to the actual shade did participants get? The results were stunning. Moderates perceived the shades of gray more accurately than extremists on the left and right (p = .01). Our conclusion: political extremists perceive the world in black-and-white, figuratively and literally</p><p>3 0.095975146 <a title="1329-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-28-%E2%80%9C._._._extending_for_dozens_of_pages%E2%80%9D.html">1090 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-28-“. . . extending for dozens of pages”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser  writes :
  
I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!  A report with one big pie chart or bar plot per page is like a text document with one w</p><p>4 0.090620995 <a title="1329-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-28-Crowdstorming_a_dataset.html">2309 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-28-Crowdstorming a dataset</a></p>

Brian Nosek, Eric Luis Uhlmann, Dan Martin, and I just launched a project through the Open Science Center we think you’ll find interesting.


The basic idea is to “Crowdstorm a Dataset”. Multiple independent analysts are recruited to test the same hypothesis on the same data set in whatever manner they see as best. If everyone comes up with the same results, then scientists can speak with one voice. If not, the subjectivity and conditionality of results on analysis strategy is made transparent. For this first project, we are crowdstorming the question of whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players.


The full project description is  here .


If you’re interested in being one of the crowdstormer analysts, you can register  here .


All analysts will receive an author credit on the final paper. We would love to have Bayesian analysts represented in the group.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan sends me  this article  from the research-methods all-star team of Katherine Button, John Ioannidis, Claire Mokrysz,  Brian Nosek , Jonathan Flint, Emma Robinson, and Marcus Munafo:
  
A study with low statistical power has a reduced chance of detecting a true effect, but it is less well appreciated that low power also reduces the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect. Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but often ignored methodological principles.
  
I agree completely.  In my terminology, with small sample size, the classical approach of looking for statistical significance leads</p><p>6 0.077465758 <a title="1329-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-21-People_kept_emailing_me_this_one_so_I_think_I_have_to_blog_something.html">725 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-21-People kept emailing me this one so I think I have to blog something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>3 0.68890047 <a title="1329-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Forensic_bioinformatics%2C_or%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_believe_everything_you_read_in_the_%28scientific%29_papers.html">360 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Forensic bioinformatics, or, Don’t believe everything you read in the (scientific) papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.  But usually I don’t drift too far from reality because I have a lot of cross-checks and I (or my</p><p>4 0.68812132 <a title="1329-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-28-Econ_coauthorship_update.html">1917 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-28-Econ coauthorship update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I  posted  some remarks on Stan Liebowitz’s analysis of coauthorship in economics.  Liebowitz followed up with some more thoughts:
  
I [Liebowitz] am not arguing for an increase or decrease in coauthorship, per se. I would prefer an efficient amount of coauthorship, whatever that is, and certainly it will vary by paper and by field. If you feel you are more productive with many coauthors, that is not in contrast to anything in my paper. My point is that you will pick the correct number of coauthors if you and your coauthors are given 1/n credit (assuming you believe each author contributed equally). If, however, all of the coauthors are given full credit for the paper (and I have evidence that, in economics at least, authors are far more likely to receive full credit than 1/n credit), authors will get credit for more papers if they use more coauthors than would otherwise be best for total research productivity. My criticism is in the inefficiency induced by not using 1/n</p><p>5 0.67801571 <a title="1329-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Fun_fight_over_the_Grover_search_algorithm.html">1120 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Fun fight over the Grover search algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points me to  this  blog entry by Robert Tucci, diplomatically titled “Unethical or Really Dumb (or both) Scientists from University of Adelaide ‘Rediscover’ My Version of Grover’s Algorithm”: 
  
  
The Chappell et al. paper has 24 references but does not refer to my paper, even though their paper and mine are eerily similar. Compare them yourself. With the excellent Google and ArXiv search engines, I [Tucci] would say there is zero probability that none of its five authors knew about my paper before they wrote theirs.
  
Chappell  responds  in the comments:

<p>Introduction: Two people separately sent me  this amusing mock-research paper  by Brian A. Nosek (I assume that’s what’s meant by “Arina K. Bones”).  The article is pretty funny, but  this poster  (by Nosek and Samuel Gosling) is even better!  Check it out:
 
   
 
   
 
I remarked that this was almost as good as my zombies paper, and my correspondent pointed me to  this page  of (I assume) Nosek’s research on aliens.
 
P.S.  I clicked through to take  the test  to see if I’m dead or alive, but I got bored after a few minutes.  I gotta say, if Gosling can  come up with  a 10-item measure of the Big Five, this crew should be able to come up with a reasonably valid alive-or-dead test that doesn’t require dozens and dozens of questions!</p><p>2 0.87721163 <a title="1329-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-13-Convincing_Evidence.html">1979 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-13-Convincing Evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Keith O’Rourke and I wrote  an article  that begins:
  
Textbooks on statistics emphasize care and precision, via concepts such as reliability and validity in measurement, random sampling and treatment assignment in data collection, and causal identification and bias in estimation. But how do researchers decide what to believe and what to trust when choosing which statistical methods to use? How do they decide the credibility of methods? Statisticians and statistical practitioners seem to rely on a sense of anecdotal evidence based on personal experience and on the attitudes of trusted colleagues. Authorship, reputation, and past experience are thus central to decisions about statistical procedures.
  
It’s for a volume on theoretical or methodological research on authorship, functional roles, reputation, and credibility in social media, edited by Sorin Matei and Elisa Bertino.</p><p>3 0.85030431 <a title="1329-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-06-Lee_Nguyen_Tran_Kim_Song_Shimazaki.html">1657 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-06-Lee Nguyen Tran Kim Song Shimazaki</a></p>

I am a recent M.A. graduate in sociology.  I am primarily qualitative in method but have been moving in a more mixed-methods direction ever since I discovered sports analytics (Moneyball, Football Outsiders, Wages of Wins, etc.).


For my thesis I studied Korean-Americans in education in the health professions through a comparison of Asian ethnic representation in Los Angeles-area medical and dental schools. 


I did this by counting up different Asian ethnic groups at UC Irvine, USC and Loma Linda University’s medical/dental schools using surnames as an identifier (I coded for ethnicity using an algorithm from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries which correlated surnames with ethnicity: http://www.naaccr.org/Research/DataAnalysisTools.aspx). The coding was mostly easy, since “Nguyen” and “Tran” is always Vietnamese, “Kim” and “Song” is Korean, “Shimazaki” is Japanese, etc.


Now, the first time around I found that Chinese-Americans and</p><p>4 0.84775072 <a title="1329-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-11-%E2%80%9CTiny%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CLarge%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CVery%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CNice%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CDumbest%E2%80%9D.html">409 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-11-“Tiny,” “Large,” “Very,” “Nice,” “Dumbest”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the past decades violent means of grabbing power have been discredited and internationally regulated. Still, grabbing power is as desired as it has always been, and I’d like to introduce some new methods used today:
  
 Establish your base of power by achieving a critical mass (75%+) within a group with a  high barrier to entry . Examples of barriers to entry: genetics (familiar ties, skin, eye color, hair type – takes 2+ generations to enter), religion (takes 2-10 years to enter), language (very hard to enter after the age of 10). 
 Encourage your followers to have  many children  – because of common ethical concerns, other groups will help you bring them up. 
 Control the system of  indoctrination , such as religious schooling, government-based educational system, entertainment, popular culture – limiting the loss of children to out-group (only needed for non-genetic barriers to entry). 
  Wait 18 years  for your followers’ children to become eligible to vote.

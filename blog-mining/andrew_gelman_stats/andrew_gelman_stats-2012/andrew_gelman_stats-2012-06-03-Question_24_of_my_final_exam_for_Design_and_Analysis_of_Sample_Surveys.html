<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>4 0.29631412 <a title="1362-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-01-Question_22_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1358 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-01-Question 22 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

 Solution to question 21 
 
From  yesterday :
  
21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
  
Solution:  Nonproportional sampling is usually avoided because it makes the analysis more complicated and it results in a higher standard error for estimates of the general population.  It might be a good idea her</p><p>5 0.15569469 <a title="1362-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Question_28_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1371 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Question 28 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

From  yesterday :
  
3. We discussed in class the best currently available method for estimating the proportion of military servicemembers who are gay. What is that method? (Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)

<p>Introduction: 17. In a survey of n people, half are asked if they support “the health care law recently passed by Congress” and half are asked if they support “the law known as Obamacare.” The goal is to estimate the effect of the wording on the proportion of Yes responses. How large must n be for the effect to be estimated within a standard error of 5 percentage points?
 
 Solution to question 16 
 
From  yesterday :
  
16. You are doing a survey in a war-torn country to estimate what percentage of unemployed men support the rebels in a civil war. Express this as a ratio estimation problem, where goal is to estimate Y.bar/X.bar.  What are x and y here? Give the estimate and standard error for the percentage of unemployed men who support the rebels.
  
Solution:  x is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man, 0 otherwise.  y is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man and supports the rebels, 0 otherwise.

<p>Introduction: 24. A supermarket chain has 100 equally-sized stores. It is desired to estimate the proportion of vegetables that spoil before being sold. The following sampling designs are considered:
 
(a) Sample 10 stores, then sample half the vegetables within each of these stores; or
 
(b) Sample 20 stores, then sample one-quarter of the vegetables within each of these stores.
 
Which of these designs has the lowest variance? Why might the higher-variance design still be chosen?

We noticed that the important topic of association measures and tests  came up again  in your blog, and we have few comments in this regard.


It is useful to distinguish between the univariate and multivariate methods. A consistent multivariate method can recognise dependence between two vectors of random variables, while a univariate method can only loop over pairs of components and check for dependency between them.


There are very few consistent multivariate methods. To the best of our  knowledge there are three practical methods:


1) HSIC by Gretton et al. (http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/papers/GreBouSmoSch05.pdf)


2) dcov by Szekely et al. (http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1267453933)


3) A method we introduced in Heller et al (Biometrika, 2013, 503—510, http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/04/biomet.ass070.full.pdf+html, and an R package, HHG, is available as well http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HHG/index.html).

Why Development Economics Needs Theory






There is no general agreement on how much we should rely on economic theory in motivating empirical work and whether we should try to formulate and estimate “structural parameters.” I (Acemoglu) argue that the answer is largely “yes” because otherwise econometric estimates would lack external validity, in which case they can neither inform us about whether a particular model or theory is a useful approximation to reality, nor would they be useful in providing us guidance on what the effects of similar shocks and policies would be in different circumstances or if implemented in different scales. I therefore define “structural parameters” as those that provide external validity and would thus be useful in testing theories or in policy analysis beyond the specific environment and sample from which they are derived. External validity becomes a particularly challenging t</p><p>5 0.93591791 <a title="1362-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-John_McAfee_is_a_Heinlein_hero.html">1616 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-John McAfee is a Heinlein hero</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “A small group of mathematicians” 
 
Jenny Davidson  points  to  this  article by Krugman on Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy.  Given the silliness of the topic, Krugman’s piece is disappointingly serious (“Maybe the first thing to say about Foundation is that it’s not exactly science fiction – not really. Yes, it’s set in the future, there’s interstellar travel, people shoot each other with blasters instead of pistols and so on. But these are superficial details . . . the story can sound arid and didactic. . . . you’ll also be disappointed if you’re looking for shoot-em-up action scenes, in which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star in the nick of time. . . .”).  What really jumped out at me from Krugman’s piece, though, was this line:
  
In Foundation, we learn that a small group of mathematicians have developed “psychohistory”, the aforementioned rigorous science of society.
  
Like Davidson (and Krugman), I read the Foundation books as a child.

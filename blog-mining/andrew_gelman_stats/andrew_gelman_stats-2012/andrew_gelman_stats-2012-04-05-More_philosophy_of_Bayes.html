<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog discussion revealed some confusion that I’ll try to resolve here.
 
I  wrote  that I’m not a big fan of subjective priors.  Various commenters had difficulty with this point, and I think the issue was most clearly stated by Bill Jeff re erys, who  wrote :
  
It seems to me that your prior has to reflect your subjective information before you look at the data. How can it not?


But this does not mean that the (subjective) prior that you choose is irrefutable; Surely a prior that reflects prior information just does not have to be inconsistent with that information. But that still leaves a range of priors that are consistent with it, the sort of priors that one would use in a sensitivity analysis, for example.
  
I think I see what Bill is getting at.  A prior represents your subjective belief, or some approximation to your subjective belief, even if it’s not perfect.  That sounds reasonable but I don’t think it works.  Or, at least, it often doesn’t work.

<p>Introduction: In response to  this article  by Cosma Shalizi and myself on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, David Hogg writes:
  
I [Hogg] agree–even in physics and astronomy–that the models are not “True” in the God-like sense of being absolute reality (that is, I am not a realist); and I  have argued  (a philosophically very naive 
paper, but hey, I was new to all this) that for pretty fundamental reasons we could never arrive at the True (with a capital “T”) model of the Universe.  The goal of inference is to find the “best” model, where “best” might have something to do with prediction, or explanation, or message length, or (horror!) our utility.  Needless to say, most of my physics friends *are* realists, even in the face of “effective theories” as Newtonian mechanics is an effective theory of GR and GR is an effective theory of “quantum gravity” (this plays to your point, because if you think any theory is possibly an effective theory, how could you ever find Truth?).

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo pointed me to  this discussion  by Christian Hennig of my recent  article  on Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
A couple days ago I  responded  to comments by Mayo, Stephen Senn, and Larry Wasserman.  I will respond to Hennig by pulling out paragraphs from his discussion and then replying.
 
Hennig:
  
for me the terms “frequentist” and “subjective Bayes” point to interpretations of probability, and not to specific methods of inference. The frequentist one refers to the idea that there is an underlying data generating process that repeatedly throws out data and would approximate the assumed distribution if one could only repeat it infinitely often.
  
Hennig makes the good point that, if this is the way you would define “frequentist” (it’s not how I’d define the term myself, but I’ll use Hennig’s definition here), then it makes sense to be a frequentist in some settings but not others.

<p>Introduction: X  writes :
  
This paper discusses the dual interpretation of the Jeffreys– Lindley’s paradox associated with Bayesian posterior probabilities and Bayes factors, both as a differentiation between frequentist and Bayesian statistics and as a pointer to the difficulty of using improper priors while testing. We stress the considerable impact of this paradox on the foundations of both classical and Bayesian statistics.
  
I like this paper in that he is transforming what is often seen as a philosophical argument into a technical issue, in this case a question of priors.  Certain conventional priors (the so-called spike and slab) have poor statistical properties in settings such as model comparison (in addition to not making sense as prior distributions of any realistic state of knowledge).  This reminds me of the way that we nowadays think about hierarchical models.

From the above expression, the Frequentist researcher concludes that the tracker is indeed biased, and rejects the null hypothesis H0, since there is a less-than-2% probability (P’<α) that a result as the one observed could arise by chance! A Frequentist thus draws, strongly, the opposite conclusion than a Bayesian from the same set of data. How to solve the riddle?
 

He goes on to not solve the riddle.  Perhaps you can?


Surely with the large sample size they have (n=10^6), the precision on the frequentist p-value is pretty good, is it not?

<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.  As Antony and I worked more on our paper, and especially after seeing the discussions by Robert Kosara, Stephen Few, Hadley Wickham, and Paul Murrell (all to appear in Journal of Computati</p><p>2 0.97614741 <a title="1247-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-31-What_is_a_Bayesian%3F.html">1438 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-31-What is a Bayesian?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo recommended that I consider coming up with a new name for the statistical methods that I used, given that the term “Bayesian” has all sorts of associations that I dislike (as discussed, for example, in section 1 of  this article ).
 
I replied that I agree on Bayesian, I never liked the term and always wanted something better, but I couldn’t think of any convenient alternative.  Also, I was finding that Bayesians (even the Bayesians I disagreed with) were reading my research articles, while non-Bayesians were simply ignoring them.  So I thought it was best to identify with, and communicate with, those people who were willing to engage with me.
 
More formally, I’m happy defining “Bayesian” as “using inference from the posterior distribution, p(theta|y)”.  This says nothing about where the probability distributions come from (thus, no requirement to be “subjective” or “objective”) and it says nothing about the models (thus, no requirement to use the discrete models that hav</p><p>same-blog 3 0.97587848 <a title="1247-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-05-More_philosophy_of_Bayes.html">1247 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-05-More philosophy of Bayes</a></p>

I was interested by your  paper  “Induction and deduction in Bayesian data analysis” and was wondering if you would entertain a few questions:
  
  
  
 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables). Bayesian inference involves calculating the objective degree of plausibility of a hypothesis (typically the truth value of the hypothesis is a function of the variables mentioned above) given such a</p><p>4 0.9730196 <a title="1247-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Statistician_cracks_Toronto_lottery.html">562 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Statistician cracks Toronto lottery</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian points me to  this  amusing story by Jonah Lehrer about Mohan Srivastava, (perhaps the same person as R. Mohan Srivastava, coauthor of a book called Applied Geostatistics) who discovered a flaw in a scratch-off game in which he could figure out which tickets were likely to win based on partial information visible on the ticket.  It appears that scratch-off lotteries elsewhere have similar flaws in their design.
 
The obvious question is, why doesn’t the lottery create the patterns on the tickets (including which “teaser” numbers to reveal) completely at random?  It shouldn’t be hard to design this so that zero information is supplied from the outside. in which case Srivastava’s trick would be impossible.
 
So why not put down the numbers randomly?  Lehrer quotes Srivastava as saying:
  
The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers. Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random</p><p>5 0.97065473 <a title="1247-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-08-Silly_old_chi-square%21.html">401 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-08-Silly old chi-square!</a></p>

I [Mulford] ran across  this blog post  and found myself questioning the relevance of the test used.


I’d think Chi-Square would be inappropriate for trying to measure significance of choice in the manner presented here; irrespective of the cute hamster.  Since this is a common test for marketers and website developers – I’d be interested in which techniques you might suggest?


For tests of this nature, I typically measure a variety of variables (image placement, size, type, page speed, “page feel” as expressed in a factor, etc) and use LOGIT, Cluster and possibly a simple Bayesian model to determine which variables were most significant (chosen). Pearson Chi-squared may be used to express relationships between variables and outcome but I’ve typically not used it to simply judge a 0/1 choice as statistically significant or not.

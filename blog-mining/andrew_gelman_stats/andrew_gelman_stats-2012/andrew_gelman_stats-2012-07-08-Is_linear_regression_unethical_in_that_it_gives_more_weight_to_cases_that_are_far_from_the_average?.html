I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?

In the recent discussion on  stopping rules  I saw a comment that I wanted to chip in on, but thought it might get a bit lost, in the already long thread. Apologies in advance if I misinterpreted what you wrote, or am trying to tell you things you already know.


 The comment  was: “In Bayesian decision making, there is a utility function and you choose the decision with highest expected utility. Making a decision based on statistical significance does not correspond to any utility function.”


… which immediately suggests  this  little 2010 paper; A Decision-Theoretic Formulation of Fisher’s Approach to Testing, The American Statistician, 64(4) 345-349. It contains utilities that lead to decisions that very closely mimic classical Wald tests, and provides a rationale for why this utility is not totally unconnected from how some scientists think. Some (old) slides discussing it  are here .

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, a few months ago Val Johnson  published  an article, “Revised standards for statistical evidence,” making a Bayesian argument that researchers and journals should use a p=0.005 publication threshold rather than the usual p=0.05.
 
Christian Robert and I were unconvinced by Val’s reasoning and wrote a  response , “Revised evidence for statistical standards,” in which we wrote:
  
Johnson’s minimax prior is not intended to correspond to any distribution of effect sizes; rather, it represents a worst case scenario under some mathematical assumptions. Minimax and tradeoffs do well together, and it is hard for us to see how any worst case procedure can supply much guidance on how to balance between two different losses. . . .


We would argue that the appropriate significance level depends on the scenario and that what worked well for agricultural experiments in the 1920s might not be so appropriate for many applications in modern biosciences . . .</p><p>5 0.10470576 <a title="1409-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Useful_models%2C_model_checking%2C_and_external_validation%3A__a_mini-discussion.html">244 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Useful models, model checking, and external validation:  a mini-discussion</a></p>

I read your paper this morning. I think we are pretty much on the same page about all models being wrong. I like very much the way you handle this in the paper. Yes, Newton’s work is wrong, but surely useful. I also like your twist on Bayesian methods. Makes good sense to me. Perhaps most important, your paper raises some difficult issues I have been trying to think more carefully about.


1. If the goal of a model is to be useful, surely we need to explore that “useful” means. At the very least, usefulness will depend on use. So a model that is useful for forecasting may or may not be useful for causal inference.


2. Usefulness will be a matter of degree. So that for each use we will need one or more metrics to represent how useful the model is.

I am an applied econometrician. The reason I am writing is that I am pondering a question for some time now and I am curious whether you have any views on it.


One problem the practitioner of instrumental variables estimation faces is large standard errors even with very large samples. Part of the problem is of course that one estimates a ratio. Anyhow, more often than not, I and many other researchers I know end up with large point estimates and standard errors when trying IV on a problem. Sometimes some of us are lucky and get a statistically significant result. Those estimates that make it beyond the 2 standard error threshold are often ridiculously large (one famous example in my line of research being Lleras-Muney’s estimates of the 10% effect of one year of schooling on mortality). The standard defense here is that IV estimates the complier-specific causal effect (which is mathematically correct). But still, I find many of the IV results (including my</p><p>4 0.7861464 <a title="1409-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-21-Fundamental_difficulty_of_inference_for_a_ratio_when_the_denominator_could_be_positive_or_negative.html">775 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-21-Fundamental difficulty of inference for a ratio when the denominator could be positive or negative</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ratio estimates are common in statistics.  In survey sampling, the ratio estimate is when you use y/x to estimate Y/X (using the notation in which x,y are totals of sample measurements and X,Y are population totals).
 
In textbook sampling examples, the denominator X will be an all-positive variable, something that is easy to measure and is, ideally, close to proportional to Y.  For example, X is last year’s sales and Y is this year’s sales, or X is the number of people in a cluster and Y is some count.
 
Ratio estimation doesn’t work so well if X can be either positive or negative.
 
More generally we can consider any estimate of a ratio, with no need for a survey sampling context.  The problem with estimating Y/X is that the very interpretation of Y/X can change completely if the sign of X changes.
 
Everything is ok for a point estimate:  you get X.hat and Y.hat, you can take the ratio Y.hat/X.hat, no problem.  But the inference falls apart if you have enough uncertainty in X.hat th</p><p>5 0.78371543 <a title="1409-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-21-Everything_I_need_to_know_about_Bayesian_statistics%2C_I_learned_in_eight_schools..html">2180 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-21-Everything I need to know about Bayesian statistics, I learned in eight schools.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I’m aware that there  are  some people who use a Bayesian approach largely because it allows them to provide a highly informative prior distribution based subjective judgment, but that is not the appeal of Bayesian methods for a lot of us practitioners. It’s disappointing and surprising, twenty years after my initial experiences, to still hear highly informed professional statisticians who think that what distinguishes Bayesian statistics from Frequentist statistics is “subjectivity” ( as seen in  a recent blog post and its comments ).
 
 My first encounter with Bayesian statistics was just over 20 years ago. I was a postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a new PhD in theoretical atomic physics but working on various problems related to the geographical and statistical distribution of indoor radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be dangerous if present at high concentrations). One of the issues I ran into right at the start was th</p><p>6 0.77885246 <a title="1409-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-01-Ratios_where_the_numerator_and_denominator_both_change_signs.html">248 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-01-Ratios where the numerator and denominator both change signs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Marc Tanguay writes in with a specific question that has a very general answer.  First, the question:
  
I [Tanguay] am currently running a MCMC for which I have 3 parameters that are restricted to a specific space. 2 are bounded between 0 and 1 while the third is binary and updated by a Beta-Binomial. Since my priors are also bounded, I notice that, conditional on All the rest (which covers both data and other parameters), the density was not varying a lot within the space of the parameters. As a result, the acceptance rate is high, about 85%, and this despite the fact that all the parameter’s space is explore. Since in your book, the optimal acceptance rates prescribed are lower that 50% (in case of multiple parameters), do you think I should worry about getting 85%.  Or is this normal given the restrictions on the parameters?
  
First off:  Yes, my guess is that you should be taking bigger jumps.  85% seems like too high an acceptance rate for Metropolis jumping.

<p>Introduction: I’m just glad that universities don’t  sanction  professors for publishing false theorems.
 
If the guy really is nailed by the feds for fraud, I hope they don’t throw him in prison.  In general, prison time seems like a brutal, expensive, and inefficient way to punish people.  I’d prefer if the government just took 95% of his salary for several years, made him do community service (cleaning equipment at the local sewage treatment plant, perhaps; a lab scientist should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc.  If restriction of this dude’s personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, he could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if he were ever more than 3 miles from his home.  But no need to bill the taxpayers for the cost of keeping him in prison.</p><p>3 0.94977248 <a title="1409-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-06-The_new_Stan_1.1.1%2C_featuring_Gaussian_processes%21.html">1710 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-06-The new Stan 1.1.1, featuring Gaussian processes!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released Stan 1.1.1 and RStan 1.1.1
 
As usual, you can find download and install instructions at:
 
http://mc-stan.org/
 
This is a patch release and is fully backward compatible with Stan and RStan 1.1.0.  The main thing you should notice is that the multivariate models should be much faster and all the bugs reported for 1.1.0 have been fixed.  We’ve also added a bit more functionality.  The substantial changes are listed in the following release notes. 
   
v1.1.1 (5 February 2012) 
======================================================================
 
Bug Fixes 
———————————- 
* fixed bug in comparison operators, which swapped operator< with operator<= and swapped operator> with operator>= semantics 
* auto-initialize all variables to prevent segfaults 
* atan2 gradient propagation fixed 
* fixed off-by-one in NUTS treedepth bound so NUTS goes at most to specified tree depth rather than specified depth + 1 
* various compiler compatibility and minor consistency issues

<p>Introduction: I received the following note from someone who’d like to remain anonymous: 
  
  
I read  your post  on ethics and statistics, and the comments therein, with much interest.


I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?

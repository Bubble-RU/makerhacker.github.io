<p>Introduction: A graduate student in public health writes:
  
I have been asked to do the statistical analysis for a medical unit that is delivering a pilot study of a program to [details redacted to prevent identification]. They are using a prospective, nonrandomized, cohort-controlled trial study design.


The investigator thinks they can recruit only a small number of treatment and control cases, maybe less than 30 in total.  After I told the Investigator that I cannot do anything statistically with a sample size that small, he responded that small sample sizes are common in this field, and he send me an example of analysis that someone had done on a similar study.


So he still wants me to come up with a statistical plan. Is it unethical for me to do anything other than descriptive statistics? I think he should just stick to qualitative research. But the study she mentions above has 40 subjects and apparently had enough power to detect some effects.

<p>Introduction: 4. Researchers have found that survey respondents overreport church attendance. Thus, naive estimates from surveys overstate the percentage of Americans who attend church regularly. Does this have a large impact on estimates of time trends in religious attendance?

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

<p>Introduction: Rhoderick Machekano writes:
  
I have a design question which has been bothering me and wonder if you can clear for me. In my line of work, we often conveniently select health centers and from those sample patients. When I am doing sample size estimation under this design do I account for the design effect – since I expect outcomes in patients from the same health center to be correlated? Given that I didn’t random sample the health facilities, is my only limitation that I cannot generalize the results and make group level comparisons in the analysis?
  
My response:
 
You can generalize the results even if you didn’t randomly sample the health facilities.  The only thing is that your generalization applies to the implicit population of facilities to which your sample is representative.  You could try to move further on this by considering facility-level predictors.  Regarding sample size estimation, see  chapter 20 .</p><p>4 0.79056603 <a title="1317-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-04-Statistics_ethics_question.html">695 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-04-Statistics ethics question</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 24. A supermarket chain has 100 equally-sized stores. It is desired to estimate the proportion of vegetables that spoil before being sold. The following sampling designs are considered:
 
(a) Sample 10 stores, then sample half the vegetables within each of these stores; or

 Solution to question 23 
 
From  yesterday :
  
23. Suppose you are conducting a survey in which people are asked about their health behaviors (how often they wash their hands, how often they go to the doctor, etc.). There is a concern that different interviewers will get different sorts of responsesâ&euro;&rdquo;that is, there may be important interviewer effects. Describe (in two sentences) how you could estimate the interviewer effects within your survey.

<p>Introduction: I keep encountering the word “Groupon”–I think it’s some sort of pets.com-style commercial endeavor where people can buy coupons?  I don’t really care, and I’ve avoided googling the word out of a general animosity toward our society’s current glorification of get-rich-quick schemes.  (As you can tell, I’m still bitter about that whole  stock market  thing.)
 
Anyway, even without knowing what Groupon actually is, I enjoyed  this blog  by Kaiser Fung in which he tries to work out some of its economic consequences.  He connects the statistical notion of counterfactuals to the concept of opportunity cost from economics.  The comments are interesting too.</p><p>2 0.98382312 <a title="1317-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-Note_to_%E2%80%9CCigarettes%E2%80%9D.html">132 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-Note to “Cigarettes”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 3. We discussed in class the best currently available method for estimating the proportion of military servicemembers who are gay. What is that method? (Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)
 
 Solution to question 2 
 
From  yesterday :
  
2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)


(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.


(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.


(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.


(d) With a small sample size, you cannot hope to learn anything conclusive, but you can get a crude estimate of effect size and standard deviation which will be useful in a po</p><p>5 0.98138517 <a title="1317-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-12-Why_it_doesn%E2%80%99t_make_sense_to_chew_people_out_for_not_reading_the_help_page.html">955 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-12-Why it doesn’t make sense to chew people out for not reading the help page</a></p>

Barry Rowlingson gave an interesting talk at UseR 2011, “Why R-help must die!” He suggested the Q-and-A type sites Stack Overflow (on programming) and Cross Validated (on statistics), both part of Stack Exchange.
  
I haven’t used R-help recently but I do occasionally send people there.  Just to see what was going on there, I  clicked on over , did a little searching, and found  this delight  from a renowned professor of R.  There’s something about the “please” there that just makes it all that much more special.  (In contrast, the advice  here  to “please do your homework” just seems rude.
 
I have a larger (or maybe smaller) point to make, though, which is about the silliness of advice to “read the damn manual” etc.

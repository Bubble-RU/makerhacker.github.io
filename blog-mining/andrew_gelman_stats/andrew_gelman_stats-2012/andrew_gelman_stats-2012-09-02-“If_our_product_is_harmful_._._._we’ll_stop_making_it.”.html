</p><p>9 The part I didn’t know about, before reading this book, is that the physical/chemical treatment (in particular, something called “flue-curing”) makes cigarettes much less irritating to the throat, so that a smoker can more easily inhale and get those carcinogens directly into the lungs.

<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>4 0.16540845 <a title="1480-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-07-Environmentally_induced_cancer_%E2%80%9Cgrossly_underestimated%E2%80%9D%3F__Doubtful..html">21 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-07-Environmentally induced cancer “grossly underestimated”?  Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>5 0.1365907 <a title="1480-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-05-For_those_of_you_in_the_U.K.%2C_also_an_amusing_paradox_involving_the_infamous_hookah_story.html">504 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-05-For those of you in the U.K., also an amusing paradox involving the infamous hookah story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll be on Radio 4 at 8.40am, on the BBC show “Today,” talking about  The Honest Rainmaker .  I have no idea how the interview went (it was about 5 minutes), but I’m kicking myself because I was planning to tell the hookah story, but I forgot.  Here it is:
  
I was at a panel for the National Institutes of Health evaluating grants. One of the proposals had to do with the study of the effect of water-pipe smoking, the hookah. There was a discussion around the table. The NIH is a United States government organisation; not many people in the US really smoke hookahs; so should we fund it? Someone said, ‘Well actually it’s becoming more popular among the young.’ And if younger people smoke it, they have a longer lifetime exposure, and apparently there is some evidence that the dose you get of carcinogens from hookah smoking might be 20 times the dose of smoking a cigarette. I don’t know the details of the math, but it was a lot. So even if not many people do it, if you multiply the risk, yo</p><p>6 0.12699766 <a title="1480-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-13-Question_of_the_week%3A__Will_the_authors_of_a_controversial_new_study_apologize_to_busy_statistician_Don_Berry_for_wasting_his_time_reading_and_responding_to_their_flawed_article%3F.html">1263 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-13-Question of the week:  Will the authors of a controversial new study apologize to busy statistician Don Berry for wasting his time reading and responding to their flawed article?</a></p>

On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>4 0.77378917 <a title="1480-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-01-%24241%2C364.83_%E2%80%93_%2413%2C000_%3D_%24228%2C364.83.html">1600 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-01-$241,364.83 – $13,000 = $228,364.83</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A blog commenter pointed me to  this  news article on Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociology professor here:
  
He was the subject last year of a grueling investigation into a quarter-million dollars of spending that Columbia auditors said was insufficiently documented, misappropriated or outright fabricated.


According to internal documents from that investigation, which were obtained by The New York Times, the auditors said that Professor Venkatesh directed $52,328 to someone without any “documented evidence of work performed.” He listed a dinner for 25 people, relating to research on professional baseball players; auditors found that only 8 people had attended . . .


All told, auditors questioned expenses amounting to $241,364.83. . . .


Professor Venkatesh said in a brief phone conversation in October that he had repaid $13,000. . . . “I have never been accused of fraud or embezzlement.”
  
One thing that frustrates me with newspaper articles is when they don’t follow up.  Venkatesh was</p><p>5 0.75840867 <a title="1480-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

A colleague of mine and I are doing a presentation for new faculty on a number of topics related to teaching.  Our charge is to identify interesting issues and to find research-based information for them about how to approach things.  So, what I wondered is, do you know of any published research dealing with the sort of issues about structuring a course and final exam in the ways you talk about in  this blog post ?  Some poking around in the usual places hasn’t turned anything up yet.
  
I don’t really know the psychometrics literature but I imagine that some good stuff has been written on principles of test design. There are probably some good papers from back in the 1920s.

<p>Introduction: When predicting 0/1 data we can use logit (or probit or robit or some other robust model such as invlogit (0.01 + 0.98*X*beta)).  Logit is simple enough and we can use  bayesglm  to regularize and avoid the problem of separation.
 
What if there are more than 2 categories?  If they’re ordered (1, 2, 3, etc), we can do ordered logit (and use bayespolr() to avoid separation).  If the categories are unordered (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), there are unordered multinomial logit and probit models out there.
 
But it’s not so easy to fit these multinomial model in a multilevel setting (with coefficients that vary by group), especially if the computation is embedded in an iterative routine such as mi where you have real time constraints at each step.
 
So this got me wondering whether we could kluge it with logits.  Here’s the basic idea (in the ordered and unordered forms):
 
- If you have a variable that goes 1, 2, 3, etc., set up a series of logits:  1 vs. 2,3,…; 2 vs. 3,…; and so forth</p><p>4 0.9386059 <a title="1480-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-25-100-year_floods.html">628 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-25-100-year floods</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to the  National Weather Service :
  
What is a 100 year flood?  A 100 year flood is an event that statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. A 500 year flood has a .2% chance of occurring and a 1000 year flood has a .1% chance of occurring.
  
The accompanying map shows a part of Tennessee that in May 2010 had 1000-year levels of flooding.
 
 
 
At first, it seems hard to believe that a 1000-year flood would have just happened to occur last year.  But then, this is just a 1000-year flood for that particular place.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t really have a sense of the statistics of these events.

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

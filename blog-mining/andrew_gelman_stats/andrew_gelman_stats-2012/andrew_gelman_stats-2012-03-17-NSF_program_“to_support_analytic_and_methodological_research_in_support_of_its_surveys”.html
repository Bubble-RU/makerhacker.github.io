<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>3 0.12953226 <a title="1217-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-14-Job_opening_at_NIH_for_an_experienced_statistician.html">660 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-14-Job opening at NIH for an experienced statistician</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (1)  Hop the Q-Train !  That is, the Columbia/NYU Quantitative Training Program, funded by the Institute of Education Sciences to create a cohort of postdoctoral scholars both to develop the new statistical methods required to meet future research challenges and to effectively train and consult with other education researchers.  You’ll be working with Jennifer Hill, Marc Scott, and me on our exciting research projects, some of which are  here !  Candidates must be United States citizens or permanent residents.  For best consideration applications must be submitted before 15 Nov 2012.  Please direct administrative inquiries to Jonathan Winters at jonathan.winters@nyu.edu and substantive inquiries to Jennifer or me.

<p>Introduction: Postdoctoral position in statistical modeling of social networks 
 
A full-time postdoctoral position is available beginning Fall 2014 in the research group of Tian Zheng and Andrew Gelman working on statistical analysis and modeling of social network data, in close cooperation with our experimental collaborators. Four key papers of this project so far are:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/overdisp_final.pdf

http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/DiPreteetal.pdf
 
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2473.pdf
 
Requirements: The work is highly interdisciplinary, and applicants must have strong statistical and computational skills.  Social science research skills are preferred but not necessary. Preferred educational background is a PhD in statistics, computer science, political science, sociology, or a related field. Expertise in Bayesian modeling and computing is required.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.


VIII. If you want to share a copy of this image, please ask first. If you want a real copy, you can ask about that too.

Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.


2. You and your readers didn’t like that the edges of the filled CI were so sharp and arbitrary.

<p>Introduction: [Update: Revised given comments from Wingfeet, Andrew and germo.  Thanks!  I'd mistakenly translated the dlnorm priors in the first version --- amazing what a difference the priors make.  I also escaped the less-than and greater-than signs in the constraints in the model so they're visible.  I also updated to match the thin=2 output of JAGS.]
 
We’re going to be starting a Stan “model of the P” (for some time period P) column, so I thought I’d kick things off with one of my own.  I’ve been following the  Wingvoet blog , the author of which is identified only by the Blogger handle  Wingfeet ;  a couple of days ago this lovely post came out:
  
  PK calculation of IV and oral dosing in JAGS 
   
Wingfeet’s post implemented an answer to question 6 from chapter 6 of problem from Rowland and Tozer’s 2010 book,   Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  , Fourth edition, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins.

<p>Introduction: Washington Post and Slate reporter Anne Applebaum wrote a  dismissive  column about Wikileaks, saying that they “offer nothing more than raw data.”
 
Applebaum argues that “The notion that the Internet can replace traditional news-gathering has just been revealed to be a myth. . . . without more journalism, more investigation, more work, these documents just don’t matter that much.”
 
Fine.  But don’t undervalue the role of mere data!  The usual story is that we  don’t  get to see the raw data underlying newspaper stories.  Wikileaks and other crowdsourced data can be extremely useful, whether or not they replace “traditional news-gathering.”</p><p>6 0.92657995 <a title="1217-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-Obama_and_Reagan%2C_sitting_in_a_tree%2C_etc..html">551 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-Obama and Reagan, sitting in a tree, etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mandelbrot on taxonomy  (from 1955; the first publication about fractals that I know of):
 
   
 
 Searching  for Mandelbrot on the blog led me to  Akaike , who also recently passed away and also did interesting early work on self-similar stochastic processes. 
 
For example, this wonderful opening of his 1962 paper, “On a limiting process which asymptotically produces f^{-2} spectral density”:
  
In the recent papers in which the results of the spectral analyses of roughnesses of runways or roadways are reported, the power spectral densities of approximately the form f^{-2} (f: frequency) are often treated. This fact directed the present author to the investigation of the limiting process which will provide the f^{-2} form under fairly general assumptions. In this paper a very simple model is given which explains a way how the f^{-2} form is obtained asymptotically. Our fundamental model is that the stochastic process, which might be considered to represent the roughness of the runway</p><p>3 0.12927052 <a title="1178-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-21-Instead_of_%E2%80%9Cconfidence_interval%2C%E2%80%9D_let%E2%80%99s_say_%E2%80%9Cuncertainty_interval%E2%80%9D.html">480 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-21-Instead of “confidence interval,” let’s say “uncertainty interval”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.  So we</p><p>4 0.12215152 <a title="1178-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-03-Boot.html">1881 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-03-Boot</a></p>

The standard analysis that Imbens proposes includes (1) a Fisher-type permutation test of the sharp null hypothesis–what Imbens referred to as “testing”–along with a (2) Neyman-type point estimate of the sample average treatment effect and confidence interval–what Imbens referred to as “estimation.” . . .


Imbens claimed that testing and estimation are separate enterprises with separate goals and that the two should not be confused.

There is no reason that such confidence intervals will have accurate coverage except under rather dire assumptions, meaning that they are not “confidence intervals” in the way that we usually think of them.

As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.


Please note I am not referring to credible intervals, but rather to the common medical journal reporting standard of confidence intervals.

The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.  Beyond that, I think there is good work in psychometrics on covaraince structures but I donâ&euro;&trade;t know the literature.</p><p>2 0.96096385 <a title="1178-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-An_Olympic_size_swimming_pool_full_of_lithium_water.html">179 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-An Olympic size swimming pool full of lithium water</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: Chris Wiggins writes of an interesting-looking summer program that undergraduate or graduate students can apply to:
  
The hackNY Fellows program is an initiative to mentor the next generation of technology innovators in New York, focusing on tech startups. Last summer’s  class of fellows  was paired with NYC startups which demonstrated they could provide a mentoring environment (a clear project, a person who could work with the Fellow, and sufficient stability to commit to 10 weeks of compensation for the Fellow).  hackNY, with the support of the Kauffman foundation and the Internet Society of New York, provided shared housing in NYU dorms in Union Square, and organized a series of pedagogical lectures. 


hackNY was founded by Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly, Evan Korth, professor of CS at NYU, and Chris Wiggins, professor of applied mathematics at Columbia.

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>6 0.92393732 <a title="1178-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-14-GiveWell_charity_recommendations.html">1623 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-14-GiveWell charity recommendations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent. In other words, if one agrees with the assumptions encoded in the model, one must also agree with the conclusions entailed by these assumptions. I am not aware of any other way of doing mathematics.

<p>Introduction: This  material should be familiar to many of you but could be helpful to newcomers.  Pearl writes:
  
ALL causal conclusions in nonexperimental settings must be based on untested, judgmental assumptions that investigators are prepared to defend on scientific grounds. . . .


To understand what the world should be like for a given procedure to work is of no lesser scientific value than seeking evidence for how the world works . . .


Assumptions are self-destructive in their honesty. The more explicit the assumption, the more criticism it invites . . . causal diagrams invite the harshest criticism because they make assumptions more explicit and more transparent than other representation schemes.
  
As regular readers know (for example, search this blog for “Pearl”), I have not got much out of the causal-diagrams approach myself, but in general I think that when there are multiple, mathematically equivalent methods of getting the same answer, we tend to go with the framework we are used</p><p>6 0.15010597 <a title="1136-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-21-Judea_Pearl_on_why_he_is_%E2%80%9Conly_a_half-Bayesian%E2%80%9D.html">1133 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-21-Judea Pearl on why he is “only a half-Bayesian”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.
  
The  article  follows with crisp discussions of each point.

<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>4 0.85079885 <a title="1136-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-11-Using_the_%E2%80%9Cinstrumental_variables%E2%80%9D_or_%E2%80%9Cpotential_outcomes%E2%80%9D_approach_to_clarify_causal_thinking.html">1492 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-11-Using the “instrumental variables” or “potential outcomes” approach to clarify causal thinking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.  Computer science student Elias Bareinboim gave the following example:  “suppose we know nothing a</p><p>5 0.82801718 <a title="1136-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-08-Understanding_Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_using_a_graph.html">2286 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-08-Understanding Simpson’s paradox using a graph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein pointed me to  this  post by Michael Nielsen on how to teach Simpson’s paradox.
 
I don’t know if Nielsen (and others) are aware that people have developed some snappy graphical methods for displaying Simpson’s paradox (and, more generally, aggregation issues).  We do some this in our Red State Blue State book, but before that was the BK plot,  named by Howard Wainer  after a 2001 paper by Stuart Baker and Barnett Kramer, although in apparently appeared earlier in a 1987 paper by Jeon, Chung, and Bae, and doubtless was made by various other people before then.
 
Here’s Wainer’s graphical explication from 2002 (adapted from Baker and Kramer’s 2001 paper):
 
 
 
   
Here’s the version from our 2007 article (with Boris Shor, Joe Bafumi, and David Park):
 
 
 
But I recommend  Wainer’s article  (linked to above) as the first thing to read on the topic of presenting aggregation paradoxes in a clear and grabby way.

We noticed that the important topic of association measures and tests  came up again  in your blog, and we have few comments in this regard.


It is useful to distinguish between the univariate and multivariate methods. A consistent multivariate method can recognise dependence between two vectors of random variables, while a univariate method can only loop over pairs of components and check for dependency between them.


There are very few consistent multivariate methods. To the best of our  knowledge there are three practical methods:


1) HSIC by Gretton et al. (http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/papers/GreBouSmoSch05.pdf)


2) dcov by Szekely et al. (http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1267453933)


3) A method we introduced in Heller et al (Biometrika, 2013, 503—510, http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/04/biomet.ass070.full.pdf+html, and an R package, HHG, is available as well http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HHG/index.html).

Why Development Economics Needs Theory






There is no general agreement on how much we should rely on economic theory in motivating empirical work and whether we should try to formulate and estimate “structural parameters.” I (Acemoglu) argue that the answer is largely “yes” because otherwise econometric estimates would lack external validity, in which case they can neither inform us about whether a particular model or theory is a useful approximation to reality, nor would they be useful in providing us guidance on what the effects of similar shocks and policies would be in different circumstances or if implemented in different scales. I therefore define “structural parameters” as those that provide external validity and would thus be useful in testing theories or in policy analysis beyond the specific environment and sample from which they are derived.

<p>Introduction: Malka Gorfine, Ruth Heller, and Yair Heller write a comment on the paper of Reshef et al. that we  discussed  a few months ago.
 
Just to remind you what’s going on here, here’s my quick summary from December:
  
Reshef et al. propose a new nonlinear R-squared-like measure.


Unlike R-squared, this new method depends on a tuning parameter that controls the level of discretization, in a “How long is the coast of Britain” sort of way. The dependence on scale is inevitable for such a general method. Just consider: if you sample 1000 points from the unit bivariate normal distribution, (x,y) ~ N(0,I), you’ll be able to fit them perfectly by a 999-degree polynomial fit to the data. So the scale of the fit matters.


The clever idea of the paper is that, instead of going for an absolute measure (which, as we’ve seen, will be scale-dependent), they focus on the problem of summarizing the grid of pairwise dependences in a large set of variables. As they put it: “Imagine a data set with hundreds</p><p>4 0.94121635 <a title="1136-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-01-%E2%80%98Researcher_Degrees_of_Freedom%E2%80%99.html">1557 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-01-‘Researcher Degrees of Freedom’</a></p>
<p>Introduction: False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant 
  
[I]t is unacceptably easy to publish “statistically significant” evidence consistent with any hypothesis.


The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?


It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields “statistical significance,” and to then report only what “worked.” The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at leas</p><p>same-blog 5 0.93452197 <a title="1136-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-23-Fight%21__%28also_a_bit_of_reminiscence_at_the_end%29.html">1136 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-23-Fight!

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

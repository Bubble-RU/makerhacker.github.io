Much of statistical practice is an effort to reduce or deny variation and uncertainty. The reduction is done through standardization, replication, and other practices of experimental design, with the idea being to isolate and stabilize the quantity being estimated and then average over many cases.

Classical statistical methods produce binary statements, but there is no reason to assume that the world works that way.

<p>Introduction: False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant 
  
[I]t is unacceptably easy to publish “statistically significant” evidence consistent with any hypothesis.


The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?


It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields “statistical significance,” and to then report only what “worked.” The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at leas</p><p>6 0.13030142 <a title="1171-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-07-I%E2%80%99m_negative_on_the_expression_%E2%80%9Cfalse_positives%E2%80%9D.html">2093 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-07-I’m negative on the expression “false positives”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>3 0.82633132 <a title="1171-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-04-Interrogating_p-values.html">1883 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-04-Interrogating p-values</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  just posted  the discussions of his paper (with Leah Jager), “An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature,” along with some further comments of his own.
 
 Here  are my original thoughts on an earlier version of their article.  Keith O’Rourke and I expanded these thoughts into  a formal comment  for the journal.  We’re pretty much in agreement with John Ioannidis (you can find his discussion in the top link above).
 
In quick summary, I agree with Jager and Leek that this is an important topic.  I think there are two key places where Keith and I disagree with them:
 
1.  They take published p-values at face value whereas we consider them as the result of a complicated process of selection.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  links  approvingly to the following  statement  by Michael Mandel:
  
Homeland Security accounts for roughly 90% of the increase in federal regulatory employment over the past ten years.
  
Roughly 90%, huh?  That sounds pretty impressive.  But wait a minute . . . what if total federal regulatory employment had increased a bit less.  Then Homeland Security could’ve accounted for 105% of the increase, or 500% of the increase, or whatever.  The point is the change in total employment is the sum of a bunch of pluses and minuses.  It happens that, if you don’t count Homeland Security, the total hasn’t changed much–I’m assuming Mandel’s numbers are correct here–and that could be interesting.
 
The “roughly 90%” figure is misleading because, when written as a percent of the total increase, it’s natural to quickly envision it as a percentage that is bounded by 100%. There is a total increase in regulatory employment that the individual agencies sum to, but some margins are p</p><p>2 0.97216415 <a title="1171-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-18-Lack_of_complete_overlap.html">1017 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-18-Lack of complete overlap</a></p>

I have a question regarding a randomizing constraint in my current funded electricity experiment. 


After elimination of missing data we have 110 voluntary households from a larger population (resource constraints do not allow us to have more households!). I randomly assign them to threated and non treated where the treatment variable is some ICT that allows the treated to track their electricity consumption in real tim. The ICT is made of two devices, one that is plugged on the household’s modem and the other on the electric meter. A necessary condition for being treated is that the distance between the box and the meter be below some threshold (d), the value of which is 20 meters approximately. 


50 ICTs can be installed. 
60 households will be in the control group.


But, I can only assign 6 households in the control group for whom d is less than 20. Therefore, I have only 6 households in the control group who have a counterfactual in the group of treated.</p><p>3 0.96149719 <a title="1171-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-09-The_effects_of_fiscal_consolidation.html">1663 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-09-The effects of fiscal consolidation</a></p>

I’ve read  a recent paper  by the International Monetary Fund on the effects of fiscal consolidation measures on income inequality (Fiscal Monitor October 2012, Appendix 1).


They run a panel regression with 48 countries and 30 years (annual data) of a measure of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on a number of covariates, including a measure of fiscal consolidation.


Footnote 39 (page 51) informs that they’ve employed seemingly unrelated regression and panel-corrected standard errors, and that to double-check they’ve also run ordinary least squares and fixed-effects panel regressions—all with similar results.


So far, so good. However, the footnote goes on to explain that “Some of the results (e.g. the causal relationship between consolidation and inequality) may be subject to endogeneity and should be interpreted with caution”. (Italics are mine).


Therefore, it seems that the crux of the exercise—i.e. estimating the relationship between fiscal con</p><p>4 0.96027607 <a title="1171-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-27-More_spam%21.html">1872 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-27-More spam!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the inbox today, under the header, “Hidden Costs behind Milk & Dairy Consumption (video)”:
  
Hey Professor Gelman,


Our site’s production team recently released a short video uncovering the local and global impact that milk has on our lives.


After spending some time on your posts, I noticed you talked about dairy products and milk so I thought I’d email you. Are you the correct person to contact in regards to the content on the site? 


If so, let me know if you’re interested in checking out the video.


Thanks, 
Emily S.

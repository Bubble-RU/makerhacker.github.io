<p>Introduction: Reviewing a research article by Michael Spence and Sandile Hlatshwayo about globalization (a paper with the  sobering message  that “higher-paying jobs [are] likely to follow low-paying jobs in leaving US,” Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
It is also a useful corrective to the political conspiracy theories of changes in the income distribution. . .
  
Being not-so-blissfully ignorant of macroeconomics, I can focus on the political question, namely these conspiracy theories.
 
I’m not quite sure what Cowen is referring to here–he neglects to provide a link to the conspiracy theories–but I’m guessing he’s referring to the famous graph by  Piketty and Saez  showing how very high-end incomes (top 1% or 0.1%) have, since the 1970s, risen much more dramatically in the U.S. than in other countries, along with claims by Paul Krugman and others that much of this difference can be explained by political changes in the U.S.  In particular, top tax rates in the U.S. have declined since the 1970s and the p</p><p>3 0.120453 <a title="1158-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-26-Lies%2C_Damn_Lies%E2%80%A6that%E2%80%99s_pretty_much_it..html">539 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-26-Lies, Damn Lies…that’s pretty much it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
We’re all used to distortions and misleading statements in political discourse — the use of these methods one thing on which politicians are fairly nonpartisan.  But I think it’s rare to see an outright lie, especially about a really major issue.  We had a doozy yesterday, when Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann presented a graphic that attributed the 2009 federal budget to the Obama administration.  Oddly, most of the other facts and figures she presented were correct, although some of them seem calculatedly misleading. If you’re going to lie about something really big, why not just lie about everything?</p><p>4 0.090966202 <a title="1158-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-09-%E2%80%9CFrontiers_in_Massive_Data_Analysis%E2%80%9D.html">1931 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-09-“Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan sends in  this  horror story:
  
A new study finds that atheists are among society’s most distrusted group, comparable even to rapists in certain circumstances.


Psychologists at the University of British Columbia and the University of Oregon say that their study demonstrates that anti-atheist prejudice stems from moral distrust, not dislike, of nonbelievers.


“It’s pretty remarkable,” said Azim Shariff, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and a co-author of the study, which appears in the current issue of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.


The study, conducted among 350 Americans adults and 420 Canadian college students, asked participants to decide if a fictional driver damaged a parked car and left the scene, then found a wallet and took the money, was the driver more likely to be a teacher, an atheist teacher, or a rapist teacher?

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>2 0.79648602 <a title="1158-lsi-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-16-%E2%80%9CIt_doesn%E2%80%99t_matter_if_you_believe_in_God.__What_matters_is_if_God_believes_in_you.%E2%80%9D.html">715 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-16-“It doesn’t matter if you believe in God.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>3 0.78266412 <a title="1158-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-29-%E2%80%9CQuestioning_The_Lancet%2C_PLOS%2C_And_Other_Surveys_On_Iraqi_Deaths%2C_An_Interview_With_Univ._of_London_Professor_Michael_Spagat%E2%80%9D.html">2191 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-29-“Questioning The Lancet, PLOS, And Other Surveys On Iraqi Deaths, An Interview With Univ. of London Professor Michael Spagat”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat points to  this interview , which, he writes, covers themes that are discussed on the blog such as wrong ideas that don’t die, peer review and the statistics of conflict deaths.
 
I agree.  It’s good stuff.  Here are some of the things that Spagat says (he’s being interviewed by Joel Wing):
  
In fact, the standard excess-deaths concept leads to an interesting conundrum when combined with an interesting fact exposed in the next-to-latest  Human Security Report ; in most countries child mortality rates decline during armed conflict (chapter 6). So if you believe the usual excess-death causality story then you’re forced to conclude that many conflicts actually save the lives of many children. Of course, the idea of wars savings lives is pretty hard to swallow. A much more sensible understanding is that there are a variety of factors that determine child deaths and that in many cases the factors that save the lives of children are stronger than the negative effects that confli</p><p>4 0.76880902 <a title="1158-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?

<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class.

<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.

<p>Introduction: Martyn Plummer , the creator of the open-source, C++, graphical-model compiler  JAGS  (aka “Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), runs a forum on the JAGS site that has a very similar feel to the mail-bag posts on this blog.  Martyn answers general statistical computing questions (e.g., why slice sampling rather than Metropolis-Hastings?) and general modeling (e.g., why won’t my model converge with this prior?).
 
Here’s the link to the top-level JAGS site, and to the forum:
  
   JAGS Forum 
    JAGS Home Page 
   
The forum’s pretty active, with the stats page showing hundreds of views per day and very regular posts and answers.  Martyn’s last post was today.
 
Martyn also has a blog devoted to JAGS and other stats news:

<p>Introduction: Julyan Arbel  plots  world record running times vs. distance (on the log-log scale):
 
   
 
The line has a slope of 1.1.  I think it would be clearer to plot speed vs. distance—then you’d get a slope of -0.1, and the numbers would be more directly interpretable.
 
Indeed,  this paper  by Sandra Savaglio and Vincenzo Carbone (referred to in the comments on Julyan’s blog) plots speed vs. time.  Graphing by speed gives more resolution:
 
   
 
The upper-left graph in the grid corresponds to the human running records plotted by Arbel.  It’s funny that Arbel sees only one line whereas Savaglio and Carbone see two—but if you remove the 100m record at one end and the 100km at the other end, you can see two lines in Arbel’s graph as well.  The bottom two graphs show swimming records.   Knut  would probably have something to say about all this.</p><p>3 0.91494173 <a title="1158-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-01-Imputing_count_data.html">14 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-01-Imputing count data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89323157 <a title="1158-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-07-The_more_likely_it_is_to_be_X%2C_the_more_likely_it_is_to_be_Not_X%3F.html">1158 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-07-The more likely it is to be X, the more likely it is to be Not X?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>5 0.88863003 <a title="1158-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-More_bad_news%3A__The_%28mis%29reporting_of_statistical_results_in_psychology_journals.html">933 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-More bad news:  The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another entry in the growing literature on systematic flaws in the scientific research literature.
 
This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data. Regrettably, only 24% of the authors shared their data, despite our request</p><p>6 0.88372338 <a title="1158-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-07-Stereotype_threat%21.html">1929 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-07-Stereotype threat!</a></p>

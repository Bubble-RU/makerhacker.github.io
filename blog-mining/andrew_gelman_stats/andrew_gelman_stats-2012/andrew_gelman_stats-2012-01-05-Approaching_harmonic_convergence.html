<p>Introduction: Steven Levitt  writes :.
  
 
Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.
 
P.S.  Levitt also writes:
  
The one thing that puzzles me [Levitt] is why in the world would he want to be on the Board of the Federal Reserve? One thing economists just don’t understand are people’s preferences.
  
To get meta here for a moment . . . just as Levitt can’t understand Diamond’s preferences, I find it extremely difficult to understand that Levitt is puzzled by Diamond’s desire to serve on the Federal Reserve,
 
It’s obvious, no?

<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>4 0.21089268 <a title="1099-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics%3A__Why_ask_%E2%80%9CWhat_went_wrong%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1100 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics:  Why ask “What went wrong?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>6 0.13320576 <a title="1099-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-10-Update_on_Levitt_paper_on_child_car_seats.html">1491 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-10-Update on Levitt paper on child car seats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stephen Dubner  writes :
  
Freakonomics Experiments is a set of simple experiments about complex issues—whether to break up with your significant other, quit your job, or start a diet, just to name a few. . . . a collaboration between researchers at the University of Chicago, Freakonomics, and—we hope!—you. Steve Levitt and John List, of the University of Chicago, run the experimental and statistical side of things. Stephen Dubner, Steve Levitt, and the Freakonomics staff have given these experiments the Freakonomics twist you’re used to. Once you flip the coin, you become a member of the most important part of the collaboration, the Freakonomics Experiments team. Without your participation, we couldn’t complete any of this research. . . .

<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>6 0.81605232 <a title="1099-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>

Huh?  Michael Jordan couldn’t hit the curveball and he was reportedly an easy mark for golf hustlers but that doesn’t diminish his greatness on the basketball court.

<p>Introduction: In the past I’ve categorized Hipmunk as  a really cool flight-finder that doesn’t actually work , as  worse than Expedia , and as  graphics without content .
 
So, I thought it would be only fair to tell you that I bought a flight the other day using Hipmunk and it gave me the same flight as Expedia but at a lower cost (by linking to something called CheapOair, which I hope is legit).  So score one for Hipmunk.</p><p>6 0.77227098 <a title="1099-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-20-Last_post_on_Hipmunk.html">917 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-20-Last post on Hipmunk</a></p>

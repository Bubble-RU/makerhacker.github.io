<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.  I commented as follows:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>4 0.23430806 <a title="1393-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.23421407 <a title="1393-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this letter  to Bruno Frey from the editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.  ( Background here , also  more here  from Olaf Storbeck.)  The journal editor was upset about Frey’s self-plagiarism, and Frey responded with an apology:
  
It was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable. . . . Please be assured that we take all precautions and measures that this unfortunate event does not happen again, with any journal.
  
What I wonder is:  How “deplorable” does Frey really think this is?  You don’t publish a paper in 5 different places by accident!  Is Frey saying that he knew this was deplorable back then and he did it anyway, based on calculation balancing the gains from multiple publications vs. the potential losses if he got caught?  Or is he saying that the conduct is deplorable, but he didn’t realize it was deplorable when he did it?
 
My guess is that Frey does not actually think the r</p><p>5 0.86640859 <a title="1393-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>6 0.85392398 <a title="1393-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-15-A_statistical_research_project%3A__Weeding_out_the_fraudulent_citations.html">1321 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-15-A statistical research project:  Weeding out the fraudulent citations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve whined before in this space that some of my most important, innovative, and influential papers are really hard to get published.  I’ll go through endless hassle with a journal or sometimes several journals until I find some place willing to publish.  It’s just irritating.
 
I was thinking about this recently because a colleague and I just finished a paper that I love love love.  But I can’t figure out where to submit it.  This is a paper for which I would prefer the so-called reverse-journal-submission approach.  Instead of sending the paper to journal after journal after journal, waiting years until an acceptance (recall that, unless you’re Bruno Frey, you’re not allowed to submit the same paper to multiple journals simultaneously), you post the paper on a public site, and then journals compete to see who gets to publish it.  I think that system would work well with a paper like this which is offbeat but has a nontrivial chance of becoming highly influential.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.

<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.

<p>Introduction: Mark Johnstone writes:
  
I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?

<p>Introduction: I’m on an island in Maine for a few weeks (big shout out for North Haven!)  This morning I picked up a copy of “Working Waterfront,” a newspaper that focuses on issues of coastal fishing communities.  I came across  an article  about modeling “fish” populations — actually lobsters, I guess they’re considered “fish” for regulatory purposes.  When I read it, I thought “wow, this article is really well-written, not dumbed down like articles in most newspapers.” I think it’s great that a small coastal newspaper carries reporting like this. (The online version has a few things that I don’t recall in the print version, too, so it’s even better).  But in addition to being struck by finding such a good article in a small newspaper, I was struck by this:
  
According to [University of Maine scientist Yong] Chen, there are four main areas where his model improved on the prior version. “We included the inshore trawl data from Maine and other state surveys, in addition to federal survey data; we h</p><p>6 0.92434621 <a title="1393-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-21-Interpreting_interactions_in_discrete-data_regression.html">1908 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-21-Interpreting interactions in discrete-data regression</a></p>

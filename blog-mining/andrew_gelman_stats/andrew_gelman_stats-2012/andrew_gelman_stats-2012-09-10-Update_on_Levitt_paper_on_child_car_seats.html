<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  and  this .  There seems to be a perception that “economists, the people who will cooly explain why people will be completely corrupt if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, see themselves as being completely not corrupt” (according to Atrios) and that “the economists who have decided to lend their names to the [Romney] campaign have been caught up in this culture of fraud” (according to Krugman).
 
The bloggers above are talking about macro, and perhaps they’re right that macroeconomists see themselves as uncorruptible and above it all.  As with political science, the key parts of macroeconomics are about what is good for the world (or, at least, what is good for the country), and it’s hard to do this well from a level of complete cynicism.  I’m no expert on macroeconomics, but my general impression is that, Marxists aside, macroeconomists tend to assume shared goals.
 
Micro, though, that’s completely different.

<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>4 0.264496 <a title="1491-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Herman_Chernoff_used_to_do_that_too%3B_also%2C_some_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_preferences.html">334 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Herman Chernoff used to do that too; also, some puzzlement over another’s puzzlement over another’s preferences</a></p>

Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!

<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.

And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.
 
2.  I think it was at best tacky and</p><p>5 0.81983304 <a title="1491-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>6 0.80226344 <a title="1491-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-20-Who_exactly_are_those_silly_academics_who_aren%E2%80%99t_as_smart_as_a_Vegas_bookie%3F.html">1632 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-20-Who exactly are those silly academics who aren’t as smart as a Vegas bookie?</a></p>

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW.

My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  noted  the following quote from applied microeconomist Steven Levitt:
  
Is it surprising that scientists would try to keep work that disagrees with their findings out of journals? When I told my father that I [Levitt] was sending my work saying car seats are not that effective to medical journals, he laughed and said they would never publish it because of the result, no matter how well done the analysis was. (As is so often the case, he was right, and I eventually published it in an economics journal.)


Within the field of economics, academics work behind the scenes constantly trying to undermine each other. I’ve seen economists do far worse things than pulling tricks in figures. When economists get mixed up in public policy, things get messier.
  
At the time, I expressed dismay about Levitt’s air of (as I read it) amused, world-weary tolerance of scientists behaving against the interest of science.  But I took his story about the car seats at face value.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>6 0.94034922 <a title="1491-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-23-Of_hypothesis_tests_and_Unitarians.html">1024 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-23-Of hypothesis tests and Unitarians</a></p>

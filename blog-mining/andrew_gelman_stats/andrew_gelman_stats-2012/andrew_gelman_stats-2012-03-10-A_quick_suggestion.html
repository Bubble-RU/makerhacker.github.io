<p>Introduction: Yair points us to  this  page full of wonderful graphs from the Stephen Wolfram blog.  Here are a few:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized. But if we start looking at individuals, we’ll s</p><p>3 0.18878752 <a title="1207-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-28-New_app_for_learning_intro_statistics.html">735 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-28-New app for learning intro statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carol Cronin writes:
  
The new Wolfram Statistics Course Assistant App, which was released today for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Optimized for mobile devices, the Wolfram Statistics Course Assistant App helps students understand concepts such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, probabilities, data points, random integers, random real numbers, and more.


To see some examples of how you and your readers can use the app, I’d like to encourage you to check out  this post  on the Wolfram|Alpha Blog.
  
If anybody out there with an i-phone etc. wants to try this out, please let me know how it works.  I’m always looking for statistics-learning tools for students.  I’m not really happy with the whole “mean, median, mode” thing (see above), but if the app has good things, then an instructor could pick and choose what to recommend, I assume.
 
P.S.  This looks better than  the last  Wolfram initiative we encountered.</p><p>4 0.17022428 <a title="1207-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-19-Alexa%2C_Maricel%2C_and_Marty%3A__Three_cellular_automata_who_got_on_my_nerves.html">1421 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-19-Alexa, Maricel, and Marty:  Three cellular automata who got on my nerves</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following two emails within fifteen minutes of each other.
 
First, from “Alexa Russell,” subject line “An idea for a blog post: The Role, Importance, and Power of Words”:
  
Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best, 
Alexa

<p>Introduction: Marty McKee at Wolfram Research appears to have a very very stupid colleague.  McKee  wrote  to Christian Robert:
  
Your article, “Evidence and Evolution: A review”, caught the attention of one of my colleagues, who thought that it could be developed into an interesting Demonstration to add to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.
  
As Christian points out, adapting his book review into a computer demonstration would be quite a feat!  I wonder what McKee’s colleague could be thinking?  I recommend that Wolfram fire McKee’s colleague immediately:  what an idiot!
 
P.S.  I’m not actually sure that McKee was the author of this email; I’m guessing this was the case because this other  very similar  email was written under his name.
 
P.P.S.  To head off the inevitable comments:  Yes, yes, I know this is no big deal and I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it.  But . . .

<p>Introduction: This story  of a Cindy Sherman impersonator reminded me of some graffiti I saw in a bathroom of the Whitney Museum many years ago.  My friend Kenny and I had gone there for the Biennial which had an exhibit featuring Keith Haring and others of the neo-taggers (or whatever they were called).  The bathroom walls were all painted over by Kenny Scharf [no relation to my friend] in his characteristically irritating doodle style.  On top of the ugly stylized graffiti was a Sharpie’d scrawl:  “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”
 
I suspected this last bit was added by someone else, but maybe it was Scharf himself?  Ira Glass is a bigshot and can get Cindy Sherman on the phone, but I was just some guy, all I could do was write Scharf a letter, c/o the Whitney Museum.  I described the situation and asked if he was the one who had written, “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”  He did not reply.</p><p>3 0.63758254 <a title="1207-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-27-Attention_pollution.html">1231 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-27-Attention pollution</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV. Only 3 of the 26 televisions we analyzed were discounte</p><p>5 0.61723173 <a title="1207-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-09-Plaig.html">1755 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-09-Plaig</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This , from Jeremy Duns (previously encountered  here ), resonates with me:
  
When I asked Thayer why he hadn’t cited Zeigler, he told me very forcefully that he had cited  everything , and accused me of libelling him: this means, presumably, that he accused me of libel without checking his article and seeing the ‘citations’ weren’t there. And when he did finally spot that, why did he not tell me I was right, apologize, get them added and explain to me, on his site, below the article or anywhere else that his editor had accidentally missed out his attributions?
  
It’s so frustrating.  The kind of people who cheat also seem to be the kind of people who lie when caught at it, and the kind of people who  never ever apologize .</p><p>6 0.61365896 <a title="1207-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-03-The_statistical_properties_of_smart_chains_%28and_referral_chains_more_generally%29.html">1882 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-03-The statistical properties of smart chains (and referral chains more generally)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The National Climatic Data Center has  tentatively announced  that 2010 is, get this, “tied” for warmest on record.  Presumably they mean it’s tied to the precision that they quote (1.12 F above the 20th-century average). The uncertainty in the measurements, as well as some fuzziness about exactly what is being measured (how much of the atmosphere, and the oceans) makes these global-average things really suspect.  For instance, if there’s more oceanic turnover one year, that can warm the deep ocean but cool the shallow ocean and atmosphere, so even though the heat content of the atmosphere-ocean system goes up, some of these “global-average” estimates can go down. The reverse can happen too.  And of course there are various sources of natural variability that are not, these days, what most people are most interested in.  So everybody who knows about the climate professes to hate the emphasis on climate records.  And yet, they’re irresistible.  I’m sure we’ll see the usual clamor of som</p><p>4 0.91352916 <a title="1207-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-28-Agreement_Groups_in_US_Senate_and_Dynamic_Clustering.html">1286 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-28-Agreement Groups in US Senate and Dynamic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrien Friggeri has a lovely  visualization  of US Senators movement between clusters:
 
   
 
You have to click the image and play with it to appreciate it. The methodology isn’t yet published – but I can see how this could be very illuminating. The dynamic clustering aspect hasn’t been researched much – one of the notable pieces is the Blei and Lafferty  dynamic topic model of Science .
 
I did a static  analysis of the US Senate  back in 2005 with Wray Buntine and coauthors. Some additional visualizations and the source code are  here . We did a dynamic analysis of US Supreme Court on  this blog  but there’s also a  paper . 
 
My knowledge on this topic is out of date, however. Who has been doing good work in this area? I’ll organize the links.

<p>Introduction: Kent Osband, author of “Pandora’s Risk: Uncertainty at the Core of Finance,” sent along  this paper :
  
Fluids are turbulent when tiny differences in space or time make for gross differences in behavior. The mathematical signature of turbulence is an endless moment or cumulant hierarchy. Bayesian tracking of continuous-time processes turns out to have a similar mathematical structure. As a result, tiny doubts about regime change or tiny errors in estimation or calculation are prone under stress to balloon into gross differences of opinion. In effect, reasonable people are bound to disagree. This finding has profound implications for our understanding of financial markets and other instruments of social learning. In particular it explains forecast degradation, frequent trading, excess volatility, and GARCH behavior without imputing widespread irrationality. Rational learning makes markets turbulent.
  
I have not tried to evaluate Osband’s argument but the general idea is very appealin</p><p>6 0.90562266 <a title="1207-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>

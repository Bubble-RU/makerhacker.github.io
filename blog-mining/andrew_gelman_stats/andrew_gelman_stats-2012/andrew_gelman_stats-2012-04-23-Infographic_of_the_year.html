<p>Introduction: Our downstairs neighbor hates us.  She looks away from us when we see them on the street, if we’re coming into the building at the same time she doesn’t hold open the door, and if we’re in the elevator when it stops on her floor, she refuses to get on.
 
On the other hand, if you’re a sociology professor in Chicago, one of your colleagues might try to run you over in a parking lot.

<p>Introduction: The Stan meeting today reminded me of Joel Spolsky’s recasting of the Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the Painter. Joel retold it on his blog,  Joel on Software , in the post  Back to Basics :
  

Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”


“I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”

<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.  The input is the heat from solar radiation (easy enough to compute given the trajectory).  On the computer I tr</p><p>5 0.69889945 <a title="1277-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-04-Peabody_here..html">2197 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-04-Peabody here.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw the trailer for the new Mr. Peabody movie and it looked terrible.  They used that weird animation where everything looks round, also the voice had none of the intonations of the “real” Peabody (for some reason, the trailer had the original English voices, maybe they didn’t get their act together to make a dubbed trailer in time for the release here), also the scenes looked pretty stupid.  I went back home and checked out Peabody on wikipedia and it turns out that they made 91 episodes!  I had no idea.
 
Anyway, here’s my real question:  Why bother making a Mr. Peabody movie if you’re not going to do it well?  I understand that lots of moviemakers are hacks and there will always be a huge audience for crap in any case, so I’m certainly not demanding that all movies be “good” (in whatever sense that means, from my perceptions).  But there are lots and lots of opportunities to make crap movies, there are a million toys and video games and comic book characters and fairy tales and br</p><p>6 0.69772357 <a title="1277-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-23-%E2%80%9CI_mean%2C_what_exact_buttons_do_I_have_to_hit%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1995 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-23-“I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  (by Frans Hofmeester) is excellent.
 
  
 
What really makes it work, I think, is that it goes slowly enough.  2 minutes and 45 seconds is enough time for me, as a viewer, to feel like Iâ&euro;&trade;m living through each stage of development.  If the video were sped up to go from 0 to 12 in only 30 seconds, that would be cool in its own way but would give up the sense of local stability that is characteristic of development.</p><p>2 0.93305373 <a title="1277-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Computer_models_of_the_oil_spill.html">243 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Computer models of the oil spill</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Wilson points me to  this visualizatio n of three physical models of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Cool (and scary) stuff.  Wilson writes:
  
One of the major advantages is that the models are 3D and show the plumes and tails beneath the surface. One of the major disadvantages is that theyâ&euro;&trade;re still just models.</p><p>3 0.93298483 <a title="1277-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-20-%E2%80%9CJoseph_Anton%E2%80%9D.html">1505 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-20-“Joseph Anton”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I only read the  review , not the book.  What puzzled me was not any  lack of self-awareness  but rather this bit:
  
The title of Mr. Rushdie’s new memoir . . . comes from the alias he assumed when British police told him back in 1989 that he needed a pseudonym: the Joseph comes from Joseph Conrad, the Anton from Anton Chekhov. The protection officers issued to him by the British government soon took to calling him “Joe,” an abbreviation he says he detested.
  
The thing that I don’t understand is why he detested the nickname.  If I were in a comparable situation, I think I’d appreciate if my security detail gave me a friendly nickname.  Then again, with the stress that Rushdie’s been under, I can imagine all sorts of personality transformations.</p><p>4 0.92622256 <a title="1277-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-09-The_guy_behind_me_on_line_for_the_train_._._..html">1796 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-09-The guy behind me on line for the train . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: . . . sounded  exactly  like a David Mamet character.  I mean, exactly.  Or like Eric Bogosian doing a David Mamet character.  I only wish I had a good ear for dialogue and could get it down for you.  OK, we don’t use the word fuck on this blog but I could substitute something like f*** and you’d get the point.
 
He was on his cell phone and seemed to be talking with his wife or girlfriend, explaining why they should get back together.  It was a bit of a cross between Alec Baldwin and Jack Lemmon.</p><p>5 0.90684652 <a title="1277-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-03-Redundancy_and_efficiency%3A__In_praise_of_Penn_Station.html">1245 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-03-Redundancy and efficiency:  In praise of Penn Station</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In reaction to  this  news article by Michael Kimmelman, I’d like to repost  this  from four years ago:
  
Walking through Penn Station in New York, I remembered how much I love its open structure. By “open,” I don’t mean bright and airy. I mean “open” in a topological sense. The station has three below-ground levels–the uppermost has ticket counters (and, what is more relevant nowadays, ticket machines), some crappy stores and restaurants, and a crappy waiting area. The middle level has Long Island Rail Road ticket counters, some more crappy stores and restaurants, and entrances to the 7th and 8th Avenue subway lines. The lower level has train tracks and platforms. There are stairs, escalators, and elevators going everywhere. As a result, it’s easy to get around, there are lots of shortcuts, and the train loads fast–some people come down the escalators and elevators from the top level, others take the stairs from the middle level.

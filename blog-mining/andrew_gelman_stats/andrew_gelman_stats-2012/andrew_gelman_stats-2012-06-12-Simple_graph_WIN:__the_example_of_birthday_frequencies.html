</p><p>6 I was pointed to some tables:              and a  graph  from Matt Stiles:         The heatmap is cute but I wanted to see the whole year’s pattern, not broken down by month, and I wanted a graph that showed quantitative patterns. [sent-8, score-1.252]
</p><p>7 Chris Mulligan’s graph (see top of this blog) was much better from my perspective. [sent-9, score-0.303]
</p><p>8 Other comments on Chris’s graph    - As Chris noted, Valentine’s Day and Halloween do show up but just barely. [sent-10, score-0.404]
</p><p>9 - You can also see dips around the Labor Day and Thanksgiving weekends which are spread a bit because the dates vary for these day-of-week holidays. [sent-11, score-0.401]
</p><p>10 - I’d consider rescaling the y-axis so the red line=100, then it would be easier for me to get a grip on the scale of the variation. [sent-12, score-0.165]
</p><p>11 - I don’t get anything out of the lowess line but it was a clever way for Chris to pull out some extreme dates automatically. [sent-13, score-0.292]
</p><p>12 (It was my idea to multiplying the 29 Feb counts by 4. [sent-14, score-0.092]
</p><p>13 Here’s how I’d start:  go back to the data for all the years and fit a regression with day-of-week indicators (Monday, Tuesday, etc), then take the residuals from that regression and pipe them back into Chris’s program to make a cleaned-up graph. [sent-16, score-0.462]
</p><p>14 It’s well known that births are less frequent on the weekends, and unless your data happen to be an exact 28-year period, you’ll get imbalance, which I’m guessing is driving a lot of the zigzagging in the graph above. [sent-17, score-0.599]
</p><p>15 - The next step would be to go back to some of the questions raised in recent years by economists who have noticed different patterns of birthdays (and thus of conceptions) as a function of age and education levels of parents. [sent-18, score-0.257]
</p><p>16 - It might be cute to to display the graph in a circle, to connect 31 Dec – 1 Jan, but I  don’t  recommend it, as this would come close to destroying our ability to see the annual pattern in the data. [sent-20, score-0.668]
</p><p>17 The moral of the story    - The direct time-series graph showed patterns clearly, allowing us to make qualitative and quantitative comparisons much better than were possible using the cute heat map or the tables. [sent-21, score-0.859]
</p><p>18 - High-resolution graphics can make a difference, even for a problem as simple as displaying a sequence of 366 numbers. [sent-22, score-0.068]

Joshua Gans sent along the following from an unpublished appendix to his paper.  It’s not the graph I was asking for but it does supply additional information beyond those two holidays.  Click to enlarge:
 
   
 
   
 
I don’t know what all those digits are doing (do you really need to know that an estimate is “-70.856″ if its standard error is “10.640″?  I’d think that “-71 +/- 10 would be just fine), but I suppose the careful reader can ignore the numbers and simply read the signs and the stars.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>5 0.17263778 <a title="1376-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-25-A_statistical_graphics_course_and_statistical_graphics_advice.html">2266 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-25-A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a></p>

Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).

<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.  On the other hand, if Evgn and I were working together on such a graph, we w</p><p>5 0.86701959 <a title="1376-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-01-Halloween-Valentine%E2%80%99s_update.html">1357 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-01-Halloween-Valentine’s update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago we  reported  on a claim that more babies are born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween.
 
At the time, I wrote that I’d like to see a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.
 
Joshua Gans sent along the following from an unpublished appendix to his paper.  It’s not the graph I was asking for but it does supply additional information beyond those two holidays.  Click to enlarge:
 
   
 
   
 
I don’t know what all those digits are doing (do you really need to know that an estimate is “-70.856″ if its standard error is “10.640″?  I’d think that “-71 +/- 10 would be just fine), but I suppose the careful reader can ignore the numbers and simply read the signs and the stars.  In any case, it’s good to see more data.</p><p>6 0.84808367 <a title="1376-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-17-%28Worst%29_graph_of_the_year.html">915 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-17-(Worst) graph of the year</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak points me to  this article  by the always-excellent Carl Bialik, slamming hypothesis tests.  I only wish Carl had talked with me before so hastily posting, though!  I would’ve argued with some of the things in the article.  In particular, he writes:
  
Reese and Brad Carlin . . . suggest that Bayesian statistics are a better alternative, because they tackle the probability that the hypothesis is true head-on, and incorporate prior knowledge about the variables involved.
  
Brad Carlin does great work in theory, methods, and applications, and I like the bit about the prior knowledge (although I might prefer the more general phrase “additional information”), but I hate that quote!  
 
My quick response is that the hypothesis of zero effect is almost never true!  The problem with the significance testing framework–Bayesian or otherwise–is in the obsession with the possibility of an exact zero effect.  The real concern is not with zero, it’s with claiming a positive effect whe</p><p>2 0.98171258 <a title="1376-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-ARM_solutions.html">240 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-ARM solutions</a></p>

The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email today:
  
Hello Andrew,


I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.


Sincerely, 
Samantha Rhodes

<p>Introduction: Dan Lakeland  asks :
  
When are statistical graphics potentially life threatening?  When they’re poorly designed, and used to make decisions on potentially life threatening topics, like medical decision making, engineering design, and the like.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has dropped the ball on communicating to physicians about infant jaundice.  Another message in this post is that bad decisions can compound each other.
  
It’s an interesting story (follow the link above for the details), would be great for a class in decision analysis or statistical communication.  I have no idea how to get from A to B here, in the sense of persuading hospitals to do this sort of thing better.  I’d guess the first step is to carefully lay out costs and benefits.  When doctors and nurses make extra precautions for safety, it could be useful to lay out the ultimate goals and estimate the potential costs and benefits of different approaches.</p><p>5 0.97823423 <a title="1376-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-07-Neutral_noninformative_and_informative_conjugate_beta_and_gamma_prior_distributions.html">1046 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-07-Neutral noninformative and informative conjugate beta and gamma prior distributions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jouni Kerman did a cool bit of research justifying the Beta (1/3, 1/3) prior as noninformative for binomial data, and the Gamma (1/3, 0) prior for Poisson data.
 
You probably thought that nothing new could be said about noninformative priors in such basic problems, but you were wrong!
 
Here’s  the story :
  
The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events. As alternative default conjugate priors, I [Jouni] introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and Gamma(1/3, 0), which I cal</p><p>6 0.97608751 <a title="1376-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-Comparing_prediction_errors.html">938 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-Comparing prediction errors</a></p>

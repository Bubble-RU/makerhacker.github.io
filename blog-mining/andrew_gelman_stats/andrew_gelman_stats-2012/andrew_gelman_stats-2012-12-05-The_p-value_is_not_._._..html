<p>Introduction: Sam Seaver writes:
  
I [Seaver] happened to be reading an ironic  article  by Karl Friston when I learned something new about frequentist vs bayesian, namely Lindley’s paradox, on page 12.  The text is as follows:

 
So why are we worried about trivial effects? They are important because the probability that the true effect size is exactly zero is itself zero and could cause us to reject the null hypothesis inappropriately. This is a fallacy of classical inference and is not unrelated to Lindley’s paradox (Lindley 1957). Lindley’s paradox describes a counterintuitive situation in which Bayesian and frequentist approaches to hypothesis testing give opposite results. It occurs when; (i) a result is significant by a frequentist test, indicating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis d=0 and (ii) priors render the posterior probability of d=0 high, indicating strong evidence that the null hypothesis is true. In his original 
treatment, Lindley (1957) showed that – under a parti</p><p>4 0.17068434 <a title="1607-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed_or_two-tailed%3F.html">2295 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed or two-tailed?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>6 0.16061638 <a title="1607-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-04-Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21.html">256 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-04-Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As a data analyst and a scientist, Fisher > Neyman, no question.  But as a theorist, Fisher came up with ideas that worked just fine in his applications but can fall apart when people try to apply them too generally.
 
Here’s an example that recently came up.
 
Deborah Mayo pointed me to a  comment  by Stephen Senn on the so-called Fisher and Neyman null hypotheses.  In an experiment with n participants (or, as we used to say, subjects or experimental units), the Fisher null hypothesis is that the treatment effect is exactly 0 for every one of the n units, while the Neyman null hypothesis is that the individual treatment effects can be negative or positive but have an average of zero.
 
Senn explains why Neyman’s hypothesis in general makes no sense—the short story is that Fisher’s hypothesis seems relevant in some problems (sometimes we really are studying effects that are zero or close enough for all practical purposes), whereas Neyman’s hypothesis just seems weird (it’s implausible</p><p>4 0.70592284 <a title="1607-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-16-The_%E2%80%9Chot_hand%E2%80%9D_and_problems_with_hypothesis_testing.html">1215 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-16-The “hot hand” and problems with hypothesis testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: From a recent email exchange:
 
I agree that you should never compare p-values directly.  The p-value is a strange nonlinear transformation of data that is only interpretable under the null hypothesis. Once you abandon the null (as we do when we observe something with a very low p-value), the p-value itself becomes irrelevant.  To put it another way, the p-value is a measure of evidence, it is not an estimate of effect size (as it is often treated, with the idea that a p=.001 effect is larger than a p=.01 effect, etc).  Even conditional on sample size, the p-value is not a measure of effect size.</p><p>2 0.9163608 <a title="1607-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-One_way_that_psychology_research_is_different_than_medical_research.html">433 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-One way that psychology research is different than medical research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.
 
Now consider how</p><p>4 0.88212645 <a title="1607-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs_in_information_graphics.html">1584 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs in information graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .


Yes, it can sometimes be possible for a graph to</p><p>5 0.87735236 <a title="1607-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-26-%E2%80%9CA_Vast_Graveyard_of_Undead_Theories%3A__Publication_Bias_and_Psychological_Science%E2%80%99s_Aversion_to_the_Null%E2%80%9D.html">1826 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-26-“A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories:  Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>6 0.87643129 <a title="1607-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-27-Caffeine_keeps_your_Mac_awake.html">975 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-27-Caffeine keeps your Mac awake</a></p>

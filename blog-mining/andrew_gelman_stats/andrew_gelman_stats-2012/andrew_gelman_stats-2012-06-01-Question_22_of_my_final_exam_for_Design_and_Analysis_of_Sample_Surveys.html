 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>4 0.34561566 <a title="1358-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>5 0.29631412 <a title="1358-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-03-Question_24_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1362 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-03-Question 24 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

From  yesterday :
  
16. You are doing a survey in a war-torn country to estimate what percentage of unemployed men support the rebels in a civil war. Express this as a ratio estimation problem, where goal is to estimate Y.bar/X.bar.  What are x and y here? Give the estimate and standard error for the percentage of unemployed men who support the rebels.
  
Solution:  x is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man, 0 otherwise.  y is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man and supports the rebels, 0 otherwise.  The estimate is y.bar/x.bar [typo fixed], the standard error is (1/x.bar)*(1/sqrt(n))*s.z, whe</p><p>4 0.84556752 <a title="1358-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-03-Question_24_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1362 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-03-Question 24 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 4. Researchers have found that survey respondents overreport church attendance. Thus, naive estimates from surveys overstate the percentage of Americans who attend church regularly. Does this have a large impact on estimates of time trends in religious attendance?
 
 Solution to question 3 
 
From  yesterday :
  
3. We discussed in class the best currently available method for estimating the proportion of military servicemembers who are gay. What is that method? (Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)
  
Solution:  I was talking about the  work  of Gary Gates, combining an estimate of the percentage of gays in the population with an estimate of the probability that someone is in the military, given that he or she is gay.</p><p>6 0.81285816 <a title="1358-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Question_21_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1356 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Question 21 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 22. A supermarket chain has 100 equally-sized stores. It is desired to estimate the proportion of vegetables that spoil before being sold. Three stores are selected at random and are checked: the percent of spoiled vegetables are 3%, 5%, and 10% in the three stores. Give an estimate and standard error for the percentage of spoiled vegetables for the entire chain.

From  yesterday :
  
21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
  
Solution:  Nonproportional sampling is usually avoided because it makes the analysis more complicated and it results in a higher standard error for estimates of the general population.  It might be a good idea her</p><p>2 0.93389308 <a title="1358-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-18-Experimenting_on_your_intro_stat_course%2C_as_a_way_of_teaching_experimentation_in_your_intro_stat_course_%28and_also_to_improve_the_course_itself%29.html">1268 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-18-Experimenting on your intro stat course, as a way of teaching experimentation in your intro stat course (and also to improve the course itself)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While visiting the education school at the University of Pennsylvania a couple months ago, I had a long conversation with Bob Boruch, a prominent researcher in the field of evidence-based education.  We shared  Fred Mosteller stories  and talked about a lot of other things too.
 
Boruch sent me an article about teaching randomized controlled trials to education students, which gave me the following idea which connects to my longstanding embarrassment (and subject of my next column on ethics, forthcoming in Chance magazine) about the lack of systematic measurement, sampling, or experimentation in our own teaching efforts.
 
Anyway, here‚Äôs my idea for experimentation in statistics teaching, an idea that I think could work particularly well in classes with education students.
 
Each class could, as part of the course, design an educational experiment to be performed on next year‚Äôs class.  Easier said than done, I know, but perhaps ed school students would be particularly motivated to do t</p><p>3 0.9321909 <a title="1358-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-10-Jobs_in_statistics_research%21__In_New_Jersey%21.html">1110 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-10-Jobs in statistics research!

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok with a good  catch :
  
In  Why Don‚Äôt Women Patent? , a recent NBER paper, Jennifer Hunt et al. [Jean-Philippe Garant, Hannah Herman, and David Munroe] present a stark fact: Only 5.5% of the holders of commercialized patents are women. One might think that this is explained by the relative lack of women with science and engineering degrees but Hunt et al. find that ‚Äúwomen with such a degree are scarcely more likely to patent than women without.‚Äù Instead, most of the difference is ‚Äúaccounted for by differences among those with a science or engineering degree‚Äù especially the fact that women are underrepresented in patent-intensive fields such as electrical and mechanical engineering and in development and design.


Predictably, the authors do not ask why women might self-selection into non patent-intensive fields, perhaps because this would require at least a discussion of  politically incorrect questions . The failure to investigate these questions leads to some dubious co</p><p>5 0.92858946 <a title="1358-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-13-Duke_postdoctoral_fellowships_in_nonparametric_Bayes_%26_high-dimensional_data.html">903 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-13-Duke postdoctoral fellowships in nonparametric Bayes & high-dimensional data</a></p>

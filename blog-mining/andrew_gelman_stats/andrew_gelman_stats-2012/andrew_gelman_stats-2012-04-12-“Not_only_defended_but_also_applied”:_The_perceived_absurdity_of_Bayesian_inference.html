<p>Introduction: Xian and I respond to the four discussants of our paper, “Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference.”  Here’s the abstract of  our rejoinder :
  
Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood. The present article arose from our memory of a particularly intemperate anti-Bayesian statement that appeared in Feller’s beautiful and classic book on probability theory. We felt that it was worth exploring the very extremeness of Feller’s words, along with similar anti-Bayesian remarks by others, in order to better understand the background underlying contr</p><p>3 0.1722815 <a title="1262-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-29-Another_Feller_theory.html">1781 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-29-Another Feller theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My paper with Christian Robert,  “Not Only Defended But Also Applied”: The Perceived Absurdity of Bayesian Inference , was recently published in The American Statistician, along with discussions by Steve Fienberg, Steve Stigler, Deborah Mayo, and Wesley Johnson, and our rejoinder,  The Anti-Bayesian Moment and Its Passing .
 
These articles revolved around the question of why the great probabilist William Feller, in his classic book on probability (“Feller, Volume 1,” as it is known), was so intemperately anti-Bayesian.  We located Feller’s attitude within a post-WW2 “anti-Bayesian moment” in which Bayesian inference was perceived as a threat to the dominance of non-Bayesian methods, which were mature enough to have solved problems yet new enough to still appear to have limitless promise.

<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>5 0.13410309 <a title="1262-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Yes%2C_checking_calibration_of_probability_forecasts_is_part_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">1610 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics.  At the end of this post are three figures from Chapter 1 of Bayesian Data Analysis illustrating empirical evaluation of forecasts.
 
But first the background.  Why am I bringing this up now?  It’s because of something Larry Wasserman  wrote the other day : 
  
  
One of the striking facts about [baseball/political forecaster Nate Silver's recent] book is the emphasis the Silver places on frequency calibration. . . . Have no doubt about it: Nate Silver is a frequentist. For example, he says:

 
One of the most important tests of a forecast — I would argue that it is the single most important one — is called calibration. Out of all the times you said there was a 40 percent chance of rain, how often did rain actually occur? If over the long run, it really did rain about 40 percent of the time, that means your forecasts were well calibrated.

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: Joel Greenhouse writes:
  
I saw your recent paper on Feller [see  here  and, for a more fanciful theory,  here ].  Looks like it was fun to write.  I recently wrote  a paper  that asks an orthogonal question to yours.  Why during the 1950-1960′s did Jerry Cornfield become a Bayesian?   It appeared in Statistics in Medicine –  “On becoming a Bayesian: Early correspondences between J. Cornfield and L. J. Savage.”
  
In his paper, Greenhouse writes:
  
Jerome Cornfield was arguably the leading proponent for the use of Bayesian methods in biostatistics during the 1960s. Prior to 1963, however, Cornfield had no publications in the area of Bayesian statistics. At a time when frequentist methods were the dominant influence on statistical practice, Cornfield went against the mainstream and embraced Bayes. . . . Cornfield’s interest in Bayesian methods began prior to 1961 and that the clarity of his Bayesian outlook began to take shape following Birnbaum’s ASA paper on the likelihood prin- cip</p><p>5 0.83736771 <a title="1262-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-13-My_wikipedia_edit.html">904 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-13-My wikipedia edit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day someone mentioned my complaint about the Wikipedia article on “Bayesian inference” (see footnote 1 of  this article ) and he said I should fix the Wikipedia entry myself.
 
And  so I did .  I didn’t have the energy to rewrite the whole article–in particular, all of its examples involve discrete parameters, whereas the Bayesian problems I work on generally have continuous parameters, and its “mathematical foundations” section focuses on “independent identically distributed observations x” rather than data y which can have different distributions.  It’s just a wacky, unbalanced article.  But I altered the first few paragraphs to get rid of the stuff about the posterior probability that a model is true.
 
I much prefer the  Scholarpedia article on Bayesian statistics  by David Spiegelhalter and Kenneth Rice, but I couldn’t bring myself to simply delete the Wikipedia article and replace it with the Scholarpedia content.

<p>Introduction: Updated version  of my paper with Xian:
  
The missionary zeal of many Bayesians of old has been matched, in the other direction, by an attitude among some theoreticians that Bayesian methods are absurd—not merely misguided but obviously wrong in principle. We consider several examples, beginning with Feller’s classic text on probability theory and continuing with more recent cases such as the perceived Bayesian nature of the so-called doomsday argument. We analyze in this note the intellectual background behind various misconceptions about Bayesian statistics, without aiming at a complete historical coverage of the reasons for this dismissal.
  
I love this stuff.</p><p>2 0.94672281 <a title="1262-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-22-Advice_on_do-it-yourself_stats_education%3F.html">1135 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-22-Advice on do-it-yourself stats education?</a></p>

I am a recent graduate looking for a bit of advice. While I took intro classes on math and statistics in my undergraduate degree as a political science major, I find myself university-less and seeking to develop my statistics toolkit.


I work for an NGO in the international development field. I think that a solid statistics foundation would offer me not only more career opportunities, but more importantly, a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the processes and problems that interest me. Iâ&euro;&trade;m talking about field experiments and practical quantitative and qualitative data analysis.


I have plenty of free time, ambition, and enthusiasm to improve this part of my toolbox, but I lack an attachment to an institution and much in the way of financial resources. How would you go about making a concentrated effort at acquiring an understanding of the field and its actual application in something like R or Stata, which I admit to never having used?

Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000. I would have twice the incentive to keep working.
 

 First, the good news

<p>Introduction: James Druckman and Jeremy Freese write: 
  
  
We are pleased to announce that Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was renewed for another round of funding by NSF starting last Fall. TESS allows researchers to submit proposals for experiments to be conducted on a nationally-representative, probability-based Internet platform, and successful proposals are fielded at no cost to investigators.  More information about how TESS works and how to submit proposals is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org.


Additionally, we are pleased to announce the development of two new proposal mechanisms. TESS’s Short Studies Program (SSP) is accepting proposals for fielding very brief population-based survey experiments on a general population of at least 2000 adults. SSP recruits participants from within the U.S. using the same Internet-based platform as other TESS studies. More information about SSP and proposal requirements is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org/ssp.</p><p>6 0.94142258 <a title="1262-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-12-Update_on_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_work_incentives.html">338 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-12-Update on Mankiw’s work incentives</a></p>

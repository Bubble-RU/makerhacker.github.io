<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.

<p>Introduction: That’s ok , Krugman earlier  slammed  Galbraith.  (I wonder if Krugman is as big a fan of “tough choices” now as he was  in 1996 .)  Given Krugman’s politicization in recent years, I’m surprised he’s so dismissive of the political (rather than technical-economic) nature of Hayek’s influence.  (I don’t know if he’s changed his views on Galbraith in recent years.)
 
P.S.  Greg Mankiw, in contrast,  labels  Galbraith and Hayek as “two of the great economists of the 20th century” and writes, “even though their most famous works were written many decades ago, they are still well worth reading today.”</p><p>4 0.13487159 <a title="1616-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-09-Blogging%2C_polemical_and_otherwise.html">1108 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-09-Blogging, polemical and otherwise</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of Paul Krugman and his critics, Noah Smith compares two styles of argumentation:
  
Way #1 is to put your complete thought process on a page – to lay out both sides of an argument, and explain why you arrived at a conclusion. This is what [Tyler] Cowen calls the “Humean” method, after David Hume. As I [Smith] see it, the Humean method is what you use if you want to get the most out of a discussion with a well-informed but fundamentally disinterested interlocutor. . . .


But not all interlocutors are disinterested. Some have political agendas. Some have strong personal biases. And not all interlocutors are well-informed. . . . In this situation, it may provide the most social benefit to adopt a more Hegelian method of argumentation. . . . two people argue their cases as strongly as possible, and observers can pick and choose the best points of each. This is how our court system works, for example. In the context of econ blogs, using a Hegelian approach means saying “</p><p>5 0.10777031 <a title="1616-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>6 0.094536401 <a title="1616-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: “A small group of mathematicians” 
 
Jenny Davidson  points  to  this  article by Krugman on Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy.  Given the silliness of the topic, Krugman’s piece is disappointingly serious (“Maybe the first thing to say about Foundation is that it’s not exactly science fiction – not really. Yes, it’s set in the future, there’s interstellar travel, people shoot each other with blasters instead of pistols and so on. But these are superficial details . . . the story can sound arid and didactic. . . . you’ll also be disappointed if you’re looking for shoot-em-up action scenes, in which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star in the nick of time. . . .”).  What really jumped out at me from Krugman’s piece, though, was this line:
  
In Foundation, we learn that a small group of mathematicians have developed “psychohistory”, the aforementioned rigorous science of society.

Tell that to Saul Bellow!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .


But if Freedom is middlebrow, it is so in the sacrosanct Don DeLillo tradition, which our critical establishment considers central to literature today. . . .

<p>Introduction: There’s this idea called “domain specificity” that I learned from my sister many years ago:  it’s the idea that a skill might work in some domains but not others. For example, knowing (some) Spanish helps a bit with my French but it doesn’t do anything for my Chinese.  Traditionally in psychometrics, this sort of thing is studied using correlation–scores on various math tests are highly correlated with each other, and these are also correlated (but less so) with scores on English tests.  Michael Jordan would probably be good at just about any sport he tried (even if he couldn’t quite hit the curveball).  Top actors can typically sing, dance, do magic, etc.–they’re great all-around performers.  And so on.
 
I was reminded of domain specificity after reading a  blog  by Felix Salmon arguing that Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers made big mistakes when they served as Treasury Secretaries during the Clinton administration.  Salmon writes:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  discusses  his and Bryan Caplan’s reaction to that notorious book by Amy Chua, the Yale law professor who boasts of screaming at her children, calling them “garbage,” not letting them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano, etc.  Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel.  Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes).

<p>Introduction: About 15 years ago I ran across this book and read it, just for fun.  Rhoads is a (nonquantitative) political scientist and he’s writing about basic economic concepts such as opportunity cost, marginalism, and economic incentives.  As he puts it, “welfare economics is concerned with anything any individual values enough to be willing to give something up for it.”
 
The first two-thirds of the book is all about the “economist’s view” (personally, I’d prefer to see it called the “quantitative view”) of the world and how it applies to policy issues.  The quick message, which I think is more generally accepted now than in the 1970s when Rhoads started working on this book, is that free-market processes can do better than governmental rules in allocating resources.  Certain ideas that are obvious to quantitative people–for example, we want to reduce pollution and reduce the incentives to pollute, but it does not make sense to try to get the level of a pollutant all the way down to zero if t</p><p>6 0.76597738 <a title="1616-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Science%2C_ideology%2C_and_human_origins.html">483 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Science, ideology, and human origins</a></p>

<p>Introduction: “A small group of mathematicians” 
 
Jenny Davidson  points  to  this  article by Krugman on Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy.  Given the silliness of the topic, Krugman’s piece is disappointingly serious (“Maybe the first thing to say about Foundation is that it’s not exactly science fiction – not really. Yes, it’s set in the future, there’s interstellar travel, people shoot each other with blasters instead of pistols and so on. But these are superficial details . . . the story can sound arid and didactic. . . . you’ll also be disappointed if you’re looking for shoot-em-up action scenes, in which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star in the nick of time. . . .”).  What really jumped out at me from Krugman’s piece, though, was this line:
  
In Foundation, we learn that a small group of mathematicians have developed “psychohistory”, the aforementioned rigorous science of society.
  
Like Davidson (and Krugman), I read the Foundation books as a child.

Why Development Economics Needs Theory






There is no general agreement on how much we should rely on economic theory in motivating empirical work and whether we should try to formulate and estimate “structural parameters.” I (Acemoglu) argue that the answer is largely “yes” because otherwise econometric estimates would lack external validity, in which case they can neither inform us about whether a particular model or theory is a useful approximation to reality, nor would they be useful in providing us guidance on what the effects of similar shocks and policies would be in different circumstances or if implemented in different scales. I therefore define “structural parameters” as those that provide external validity and would thus be useful in testing theories or in policy analysis beyond the specific environment and sample from which they are derived. External validity becomes a particularly challenging t</p><p>3 0.87713945 <a title="1616-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-01-Heller%2C_Heller%2C_and_Gorfine_on_univariate_and_multivariate_information_measures.html">2314 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-01-Heller, Heller, and Gorfine on univariate and multivariate information measures</a></p>

We noticed that the important topic of association measures and tests  came up again  in your blog, and we have few comments in this regard.


It is useful to distinguish between the univariate and multivariate methods. A consistent multivariate method can recognise dependence between two vectors of random variables, while a univariate method can only loop over pairs of components and check for dependency between them.


There are very few consistent multivariate methods. To the best of our  knowledge there are three practical methods:


1) HSIC by Gretton et al. (http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/papers/GreBouSmoSch05.pdf)


2) dcov by Szekely et al. (http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1267453933)


3) A method we introduced in Heller et al (Biometrika, 2013, 503—510, http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/04/biomet.ass070.full.pdf+html, and an R package, HHG, is available as well http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HHG/index.html).

<p>Introduction: False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant 
  
[I]t is unacceptably easy to publish “statistically significant” evidence consistent with any hypothesis.


The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?


It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields “statistical significance,” and to then report only what “worked.” The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at leas</p><p>5 0.8678602 <a title="1616-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-10-Some_interesting_unpublished_ideas_on_survey_weighting.html">705 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-10-Some interesting unpublished ideas on survey weighting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago we had an amazing all-star session at the Joint Statistical Meetings.  The topic was new approaches to survey weighting (which is  a mess , as I’m sure you’ve heard).
 
Xiao-Li Meng  recommended shrinking weights by taking them to a fractional power (such as square root) instead of trimming the extremes. 
 
Rod Little  combined design-based and model-based survey inference. 
 
Michael Elliott  used mixture models for complex survey design.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Joan Garfield, a leading researcher in statistics education, is conducting a survey of graduate students who teach or assist with the teaching of statistics.  She writes: 
  
  
We want to invite them to take a short survey that will enable us to collect some baseline data that we may use in a grant proposal we are developing.  The project would provide summer workshops and ongoing support for graduate students who will be teaching or assisting with teaching introductory statistics classes. If the grant is funded, we would invite up to 40 students from around the country who are entering graduate programs in statistics to participate in a three-year training and support program.  The goal of this program is to help these students become expert and flexible teachers of statistics, and to support them as they move through their teaching experiences as graduate students.

<p>Introduction: Frontiers of Science is a course offered as part of Columbia University’s Core Curriculum.  The course is controversial, with some people praising its overview of several areas of science, and others feeling that a more traditional set of introductory science courses would do the job better.
 
Last month, the faculty in charge of the course wrote the following public  letter : 
  
  
The United States is in the midst of a debate over the value of a traditional college education. Why enroll in a place like Columbia College when you can obtain an undergraduate degree for $10,000 or learn everything from Massive Open Online Courses? In more parochial terms, what is the value added by approaches such as Columbia’s Core Curriculum? Recently students in our Core Course, Frontiers of Science (FoS), provided a partial answer. The FoS faculty designed a survey to gauge the scientific skills and knowledge of the Class of 2016 both before and after taking FoS.

Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.

<p>Introduction: While visiting the education school at the University of Pennsylvania a couple months ago, I had a long conversation with Bob Boruch, a prominent researcher in the field of evidence-based education.  We shared  Fred Mosteller stories  and talked about a lot of other things too.
 
Boruch sent me an article about teaching randomized controlled trials to education students, which gave me the following idea which connects to my longstanding embarrassment (and subject of my next column on ethics, forthcoming in Chance magazine) about the lack of systematic measurement, sampling, or experimentation in our own teaching efforts.
 
Anyway, here’s my idea for experimentation in statistics teaching, an idea that I think could work particularly well in classes with education students.
 
Each class could, as part of the course, design an educational experiment to be performed on next year’s class.  Easier said than done, I know, but perhaps ed school students would be particularly motivated to do t</p><p>3 0.78430486 <a title="1582-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Online_Education_and_Jazz.html">1752 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Online Education and Jazz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>5 0.78248614 <a title="1582-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-09-Kaggle%3A__forecasting_competitions_in_the_classroom.html">402 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-09-Kaggle:  forecasting competitions in the classroom</a></p>

For those who haven’t come across Kaggle, we are a new platform for data prediction competitions. Companies and researchers put up a dataset and a problem and data scientists compete to produce the best solutions. 


We’ve just launched a new initiative called Kaggle in Class, allowing instructors to host competitions for their students. Competitions are a neat way to engage students, giving them the opportunity to put into practice what they learn. The platform offers live leaderboards, so students get instant feedback on the accuracy of their work. And since competitions are judged on objective criteria (predictions are compared with outcomes), the platform offers unique assessment 
opportunities.


The first Kaggle in Class competition is being hosted by Stanford University’s Stats 202 class and requires students to predict the price of different wines based on vintage, country, ratings and other information.

<p>Introduction: Some things I respect 
 
When it comes to meta-models of statistics, here are two philosophies that I respect:
 
1.  (My) Bayesian approach, which I associate with E. T. Jaynes, in which you construct models with strong assumptions, ride your models hard, check their fit to data, and then scrap them and improve them as necessary.
 
2.  At the other extreme, model-free statistical procedures that are designed to work well under very weak assumptions—for example, instead of assuming a distribution is Gaussian, you would just want the procedure to work well under some conditions on the smoothness of the second derivative of the log density function.
 
Both the above philosophies recognize that (almost) all important assumptions will be wrong, and they resolve this concern via aggressive model checking or via robustness.  And of course there are intermediate positions, such as working with Bayesian models that have been shown to be robust, and then still checking them.  Or, to flip it arou</p><p>2 0.9904635 <a title="1582-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-09-Allowing_interaction_terms_to_vary.html">753 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-09-Allowing interaction terms to vary</a></p>

I am a 2nd year graduate student in political science at the University of Vienna. In my empirical research I often employ multilevel modeling, and recently I came across a situation that kept me wondering for quite a while. As I did not find much on this in the literature and considering the topics that you work on and blog about, I figured I will try to contact you.
      
The situation is as follows: in a linear multilevel model, there are two important individual level predictors (x1 and x2) and a set of controls. Let us assume that there is a theoretically grounded argument suggesting that an interaction between x1 and x2 should be included in the model (x1 * x2). Both x1 and x2 are let to vary randomly across groups. Would this directly imply that the coefficient of the interaction should also be left to vary across country? This is even more burning if there is no specific hypothesis on the variance of the conditional effect across countries.

I’m teaching my first graduate class this semester. It’s intro stats for graduate students in the college of education. Most of the students are first year PhD students. Though, there are a number of master’s students who are primarily in-service teachers. The difficulties with teaching an undergraduate intro stats course are still present, in that mathematical preparation and phobia vary widely across the class.


I’ve been enjoying the class and the students, but I’d like your take on an issue I’ve been thinking about. How do I balance teaching the standard methods, like hypothesis testing, that these future researchers have to know because they are so standard, with discussing the problems with those methods (e.g.  p-value as a measure of sample size , and  the decline effect , not to mention multiple testing and other common mistakes).

<p>Introduction: Lots of good statistical methods make use of two models.  For example:
 
- Classical statistics:  estimates and standard errors using the likelihood function; tests and p-values using the sampling distribution.  (The sampling distribution is  not  equivalent to the likelihood, as has been much discussed, for example in sequential stopping problems.)
 
- Bayesian data analysis:  inference using the posterior distribution; model checking using the predictive distribution (which, again, depends on the data-generating process in a way that the likelihood does not).
 
- Machine learning:  estimation using the data; evaluation using cross-validation (which requires some rule for partitioning the data, a rule that stands outside of the data themselves).
 
- Bootstrap, jackknife, etc:  estimation using an “estimator” (which, I would argue, is based in some sense on a model for the data), uncertainties using resampling (which, I would argue, is close to the idea of a “sampling distribution” in</p><p>5 0.98947358 <a title="1582-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-28-Economists_argue_about_Bayes.html">1695 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-28-Economists argue about Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

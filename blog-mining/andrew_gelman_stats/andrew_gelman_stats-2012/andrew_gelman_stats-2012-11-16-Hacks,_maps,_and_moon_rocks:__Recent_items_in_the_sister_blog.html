<p>Introduction: According to  Chris Wilson , there are two versions of the report of the Occupy Wall Street poll from  so-called  hack pollster Doug Schoen.
 
 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.
 
P.S.   More here  from Kaiser Fung on fundamental flaws with Schoen’s poll.</p><p>3 0.14844155 <a title="1579-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-12-Elderpedia.html">1531 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-12-Elderpedia</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Everybody knows how you can lie with statistics by manipulating numbers, making inappropriate comparisons, misleading graphs, etc.  But, as I like to remind students, the simplest way to lie with statistics is to just lie!  You see this all the time, advocates who make up numbers or present numbers with such little justification that they might as well be made up (as in  this  purported survey of the “super-rich”).
 
Here I’m not talking about the  innumeracy  of a Samantha Power or  a  David Runciman, or Michael Barone-style  confusion  or Gregg Easterbrook-style  cluelessness  or even Tucker Carlson-style  asininity .  No, I’m talking about flat-out lying by a professional who has the numbers and deliberately chooses to misrepresent them.
 
The culprit is pollster Doug Schoen, and  the catch  was made by Jay Livingston.  Schoen wrote the following based on a survey he took of Occupy Wall Street participants:

<p>Introduction: Nadia Hassan writes:
  
In your  review  of the Jacobs and Page book, you argued that while there was an open question of whether government could give voters what they wanted in light of the tax increases they might accept, Jacobs and Page were pretty persuasive about targeted tax hikes and specific programs especially against the freeloader view.  Recent discussions, and some focus groups  bear out these points exactly.

<p>Introduction: Gregg Easterbrook :
  
Gingrich is a wild card. He probably would end up a flaming wreckage in electoral terms, but there’s a chance he could become seen as the man unafraid to bring sweeping change to an ossified Washington, D.C. There’s perhaps a 90 percent likelihood Obama would wipe the floor with Gingrich, versus a 10 percent likelihood Gingrich would stage an historic upset.
  
This is the dumbest thing I’ve seen since . . . ummm, I dunno, how bout  this ?  It actually gets worse because Easterbrook then invokes game theory.  What next?  Catastrophe theory?  Intelligent design?
 
P.S.  Maybe I should explain for readers without an education in probability theory.  Let’s suppose “wipe the floor” means that Obama gets 55%+ of the two-party vote, and let’s suppose that “an historic upset” means that Obama gets less than 50% of the vote.  Now try to draw a forecast distribution that has 90% of its probability above 0.55 and 10% of it’s probability below 0.50.  It’s a pretty weird-loo</p><p>3 0.64263445 <a title="1579-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>4 0.64206469 <a title="1579-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-14-The_most_clueless_political_column_ever%E2%80%94I_think_this_Easterbrook_dude_has_the_journalistic_equivalent_of_%E2%80%9Ctenure%E2%80%9D.html">959 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-14-The most clueless political column ever—I think this Easterbrook dude has the journalistic equivalent of “tenure”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t know when I’ve seen political writing quote so misinformed as this. It’s a bizarre mixture of cliches, non-sequitors, and outright mistakes.
 
The author is Gregg Easterbrook and he’s writing for  Reuters .
 
First, the cliches:
  
Right now Romney seems to be the frontrunner, which, of course, is a mixed blessing. His aura of experience and reasonableness could prove quite appealing to voters. Perry continues to have the potential to light a populist fire. . . . Of all the 2012 candidates, Huntsman is the one who is Not Just Another Politician.
  
And now the errors.
  
At this point in the 1992 election cycle, the elder George Bush held an 89 percent approval rating. . . . Clinton beat a popular incumbent with a fantastic approval rating. For the 2012 election, Barack Obama is just as vulnerable as the elder Bush, if not even more so. Obama currently has an approval rating of 23 percent.
  
This is all fine, except that:

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had. There’s a  nice sor</p><p>6 0.56823528 <a title="1579-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-01-Recently_in_the_sister_blogs%3A__special_pre-election_edition%21.html">1556 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-01-Recently in the sister blogs:  special pre-election edition!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I only read the  review , not the book.  What puzzled me was not any  lack of self-awareness  but rather this bit:
  
The title of Mr. Rushdie’s new memoir . . . comes from the alias he assumed when British police told him back in 1989 that he needed a pseudonym: the Joseph comes from Joseph Conrad, the Anton from Anton Chekhov. The protection officers issued to him by the British government soon took to calling him “Joe,” an abbreviation he says he detested.
  
The thing that I don’t understand is why he detested the nickname.  If I were in a comparable situation, I think I’d appreciate if my security detail gave me a friendly nickname.  Then again, with the stress that Rushdie’s been under, I can imagine all sorts of personality transformations.</p><p>3 0.49334154 <a title="1579-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Demographics%3A_what_variable_best_predicts_a_financial_crisis%3F.html">149 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Demographics: what variable best predicts a financial crisis?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I wrote about the importance of demographics in  political trends . Today I’d like to show you how demographics help predict financial crises.
 
Here are a few examples of countries with major crises.
  
 
 
 The working-age population in Japan  peaked in the 1995 census . 
  The 1995 Financial Crisis in Japan  
 
 
 
 
  The working-age USA population growth slows down to unprecedented levels in 2008 (see figure below) 

 

  Financial crisis of 2007-2010 . (Also, notice previous dips in 2001, 1991 and 1981, and consider the  list of recessions .) 
 
 
  China’s working-age population, age 15 to 64, has grown continuously. The labor pool will  peak in 2015  and then decline.  
  
There are more charts in  Demography and Growth  report by the Reserve Bank of Australia:
 
   
 
Wikipedia surveys  the causes of the financial crisis,  such as “liquidity shortfall in the United States banking system caused by the overvaluation of assets”. Oh my!

<p>Introduction: Chris Wilson points me to  this visualizatio n of three physical models of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Cool (and scary) stuff.  Wilson writes:
  
One of the major advantages is that the models are 3D and show the plumes and tails beneath the surface. One of the major disadvantages is that theyâ&euro;&trade;re still just models.</p><p>5 0.36706078 <a title="1579-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-17-Horrible_but_harmless%3F.html">1581 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-17-Horrible but harmless?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Basbøll writes:
  
In re your recent  post : Can you make sense of  this ?
  
My reply: This is not the kind of thing that I like at all. But for some reason it doesn’t bother me enough for me to want to mock it. Perhaps because I sense that the people who write this sort of thing have very little power or influence.
 
Then again, a check of Wikipedia reveals that the author of the above article is “currently Professor and Bill Daniels Ethics Fellow, a past endowed Bank of America professor of management at New Mexico State University.” The connection between “Ethics Fellow” and “Bank of America professor of management,” that’s a bit creepy.</p><p>6 0.3423757 <a title="1579-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-05-A_cloud_with_a_silver_lining.html">1198 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-05-A cloud with a silver lining</a></p>

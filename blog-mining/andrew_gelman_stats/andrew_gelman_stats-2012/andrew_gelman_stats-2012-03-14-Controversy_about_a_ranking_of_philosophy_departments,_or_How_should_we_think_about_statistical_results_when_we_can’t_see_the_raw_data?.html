Your  recent post  on sharing data was of great interest to me, as my own research in computer science asks how to incentivize and lower barriers to data sharing.   I was particularly curious about your highlighting of effort as the major dis-incentive to sharing.  I would love to hear more, as this question of effort is on we specifically target in our development of tools for data authoring and publishing.


As a straw man, let me point out that sharing data technically requires no more than posting an excel spreadsheet online.  And that you likely already produced that spreadsheet during your own analytic work.   So, in what way does such low-tech publishing fail to meet your data sharing objectives?


Our own hypothesis has been that the effort is really quite low, with the problem being a lack of *immediate/tangible* benefits (as opposed to the long-term values you accurately describe).

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Sam Behseta, the new editor of Chance magazine, asked me if I’d like to have a column.  I said yes, I’d like to write on ethics and statistics.  My  first column  was called “Open Data and Open Methods” and I discussed the ethical obligation to share data and make our computations transparent wherever possible.  In my column, I recounted a story from a bit over 20 years ago when I noticed a problem in a published analysis (involving electromagnetic fields and calcium flow in chicken brains) and contacted the researcher in charge of the study, who would not share his data with me.
 
Two of the people from that research team—biologist Carl Blackman and statistician Dennis House—saw my Chance column and felt that I had misrepresented the situation and had criticized them unfairly.
 
Blackman and House expressed their concerns in letters to the editor which were just published, along with my reply, in the latest issue of  Chance .

<p>Introduction: Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers have been inspired by the recent Reinhardt and Rogoff  debacle  to  list  “six ways to separate lies from statistics” in economics research:
  
1. “Focus on how robust a finding is, meaning that different ways of looking at the evidence point to the same conclusion.”


2.  Don’t confuse statistical with practical significance.


3.  “Be wary of scholars using high-powered statistical techniques as a bludgeon to silence critics who are not specialists.”


4.  “Don’t fall into the trap of thinking about an empirical finding as ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ At best, data provide an imperfect guide.”


5.  “Don’t mistake correlation for causation.”


6.  “Always ask ‘so what?’”
  
I like all these points, especially #4, which I think doesn’t get said enough.  As I  wrote  a few months ago, high-profile social science research aims for proof, not for understanding—and that’s a problem.

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>4 0.82205027 <a title="1212-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-03-This_post_does_not_mention_Wegman.html">989 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-03-This post does not mention Wegman</a></p>

Since you have commented on scientific fraud a lot. I wanted to give you an update on the  Diederik Stapel  case. I’d rather not see my name on the blog if you would elaborate on this any further.  It is long but worth the read I guess.
  
I’ll first give you the horrible details which will fill you with a mixture of horror and stupefied amazement at Stapel’s behavior.  Then I’ll share Stapel’s abject apology, which might make you feel sorry for the guy.
 
First the amazing story of how he perpetrated the fraud: 
  
  
There has been an interim report delivered to the rector of Tilburg University.


Tilburg University is cooperating with the university of Amsterdam and of Groningen in this case. The results are pretty severe, I provide here a quick and literal translation of some comments by the chairman of the investigation committee. This report is publicly available on the university webpage (along with some other things of interest) but in Dutch:

In my column, I recounted a story from a bit over 20 years ago when I noticed a problem in a published analysis (involving electromagnetic fields and calcium flow in chicken brains) and contacted the researcher in charge of the study, who would not share his data with me.
 
Two of the people from that research team—biologist Carl Blackman and statistician Dennis House—saw my Chance column and felt that I had misrepresented the situation and had criticized them unfairly.
 
Blackman and House expressed their concerns in letters to the editor which were just published, along with my reply, in the latest issue of  Chance .

<p>Introduction: This  blog  by J. Robert Lennon on abandoned novels made me think of the more general topic of abandoned projects.  I seem to recall George V. Higgins writing that he’d written and discarded 14 novels or so before publishing The Friends of Eddie Coyle.
 
I haven’t abandoned any novels but I’ve abandoned lots of research projects (and also have started various projects that there’s no way I’ll finish).  If you think about the decisions involved, it really has to be that way. You learn while you’re working on a project whether it’s worth continuing.  Sometimes I’ve put in the hard work and pushed a project to completion, published the article, and then I think . . . what was the point?  The modal number of citations of our articles is zero, etc.</p><p>2 0.92987072 <a title="1212-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-27-Confusion_from_illusory_precision.html">1186 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-27-Confusion from illusory precision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.  I can’t believe anyone has such a precise estimate of the health effects of pesticides, and also I can’t believe anyone has such a precise effect of the health effect of eating an app</p><p>3 0.92262298 <a title="1212-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-10-My_talk_at_MIT_on_Thurs_11_Oct.html">1528 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-10-My talk at MIT on Thurs 11 Oct</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan: open-source Bayesian inference 
 
Speaker: Andrew Gelman, Columbia University 
Date: Thursday, October 11 2012 
Time: 4:00PM to 5:00PM

Stan ( mc-stan.org ) is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We discuss how Stan works and what it can do, the problems that motivated us to write Stan, current challenges, and areas of planned development, including tools for improved generality and usability, more efficient sampling algorithms, and fuller integration of model building, model checking, and model understanding in Bayesian data analysis.

<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about this because we seem to be circling around the same few topics over and over (while occasionally slipping in some new statistical ideas): 
   
10. Wegman 
9. Hipmunk 
8. Dennis the dentist 
7. Freakonomics 
6. The difference between significant and non-significant is not itself statistically significant 
5. Just use a hierarchical model already! 
4. Innumerate journalists who think that presidential elections are just like high school 
3. A graph can be pretty but convey essentially no information 
2. Stan is coming 
1. Clippy!

<p>Introduction: Jeff Helzner writes:
  
A friend of mine and I  cited  your  open data article  in our attempts to persuade a professor at another institution [Brian Leiter] into releasing the raw data from his influential rankings of philosophy departments. He is now claiming the national security response:

 
. . . disclosing the reputational data would violate the terms on  which the evaluators agreed to complete the surveys (did they even bother to read the description of the methodology, one wonders?).
 

I [Helzner] do not find this to be a compelling reply in this case. In fact, I  would say that when such data cannot be disclosed it reveals a flaw in the design of the survey. Experimental designs must be open so  that others can run the experiment. Mathematical proofs must be open so that they can be reviewed by others. Likewise, it seems to me that the details of statistical argument should be open to inspection. Do you have any thoughts on this?

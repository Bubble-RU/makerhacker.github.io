<p>Introduction: Business statistician  Kaiser Fung  just came out with another book, this one full of stories about how organizations use data:
 
1.  Why do law school deans send each other junk mail?
 
2.  Can a new statistic make us less fat?
 
3.  How can sellouts ruin a business?
 
4.  Will personalizing deals save Groupon?
 
5.  Why do marketers send you mixed messages?
 
6.  Are they new jobs if no one can apply?
 
7.  How much did you pay for the eggs?
 
8.  Are you a better coach or manager?
 
Unlike most books of this sort, there’s no hero:  These are not stories about a fabulous businessman who made millions of dollars by following his dream and taking the customer seriously, nor are they Gladwellian sagas of brilliant scientists, nor are they auto-Gladwellian tales of the Ariely variety.  In some ways, the stories in Fung’s book have the form of opened-up business reporting, in which you get to see the statistical models underlying various assumptions and conclusions.  In that sense, this b</p><p>5 0.11768113 <a title="1405-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-%24.html">1003 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.  I’d like to think that if</p><p>6 0.10674375 <a title="1405-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-22-Krugman_sets_the_bar_too_high.html">1733 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-22-Krugman sets the bar too high</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was stunned  this  from Jenny Davidson about mystery writers:
  
The crime fiction community is smart and adult and welcoming, and so many good books are being written (Lee Child was mentioning his peer group – i.e. they were the new kids around the same tie – being Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman – the list speaks for itself) . . .
  
Why was I stunned?  Because just a few days earlier I had a look at a book by Robert Crais.  It just happened that Phil, when he was visiting, had finished this book (which he described as “pretty good”) and left it with me so he wouldn’t have to take it back with him.  I’d never heard of Crais, but it had pretty amazing blurbs on the cover and Phil recommended it, so I took a look.
 
It was bad.  From page 1 it was bad.  It was like a bad cop show.  I could see the seams where the sentences were stitched together.  I could see how  somebody  might like this sort of book, but I certainly can’t understand the blurbs or the i</p><p>3 0.8195231 <a title="1405-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-21-Why_modern_art_is_all_in_the_mind.html">102 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-21-Why modern art is all in the mind</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”
  
This sounds fascinating.  But I’m skeptical about this part:

<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, David Frum  writes , of a book by historian Laura Kalman about the politics of the 1970s:
  
 
As a work of history about the Ford and Carter years, there is nothing seriously wrong with it. The facts are accurate, the writing is clear and the point of view is not tendentious. Once upon a time, such a book might have been useful to somebody.


But the question it raises–and it’s not a question about this book alone–is: What’s the point of this kind of history in the age of the Internet? Suppose I’m an undergraduate who stumbles for the first time across the phrase “Proposition 13.” I could, if I were minded, walk over to the university library, pull this book from the shelf and flip to the index. Or I could save myself two hours and Google it. I wouldn’t learn more from a Google search than I’d learn in these pages. But I wouldn’t learn a whole lot less either.
 

 
As a textbook writer, I think about some of these issues too!

<p>Introduction: This was an good idea:  take a bunch of old (and some recent) news articles on developments in mathematics and related ares from the past hundred years.  Fun for the math content and historical/nostalgia value.  Relive the four-color theorem, Fermat, fractals, and early computing.
 
I have too much of a technical bent to be the ideal reader for this sort of book, but it seems like an excellent gift for a non-technical reader who nonetheless enjoys math.  (I assume that such people are out there, just as there are people like me who canâ&euro;&trade;t read music but still enjoy reading about the subject.)
 
The book is organized by topic.  My own preference would have been chronological and with more old stuff.  I particularly enjoyed the material from many decades ago, such as the news report on one of the early computers.  This must have been a fun book to compile.</p><p>6 0.79701763 <a title="1405-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-27-The_M%C3%B6bius_strip%2C_or%2C_marketing_that_is_impervious_to_criticism.html">1641 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-27-The Möbius strip, or, marketing that is impervious to criticism</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just finished reading this book by Kevin Cook.  Nothing surprising, but it’s got almost all the stories, including many that I’d never previously read.  Excellent if you like that sort of thing.  It’s just too bad Thompson wasn’t around to golf-hustle Michael Jordan, back when that was big business.</p><p>2 0.97226989 <a title="1405-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-21-If_a_lottery_is_encouraging_addictive_gambling%2C_don%E2%80%99t_expand_it%21.html">1731 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-21-If a lottery is encouraging addictive gambling, don’t expand it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>4 0.96494019 <a title="1405-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-04-%E2%80%9CWho_owns_Congress%E2%80%9D.html">319 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-04-“Who owns Congress”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Curt Yeske pointed me to  this .  Wow–these graphs are really hard to read!
 
The old me would’ve said that each of these graphs would be better replaced by a dotplot (or, better still, a series of lineplots showing time trends).
 
The new me would still like the dotplots and lineplots, but I’d say it’s fine to have the eye-grabbing but hard-to-read graphs as is, and then to have the more informative statistical graphics underneath, as it were.  The idea is, you’d click on the pretty but hard-to-read “infovis” graphs, and this would then reveal informative “full Cleveland” graphs.  And then if you click again you’d get a spreadsheet with the raw numbers.

<p>Introduction: Michael Axelrod writes: 
  
  
Quantitative historian Allan Lichtman claims to have discovered 13 predictors that determine who will win the popular vote in presidential elections. He predicts Obama will win in 2012. Writing in his New York Times column, “538,” Nate Silver attempted a critique Lichtman’s prediction. Soon afterward Lichtman wrote a rejoinder. Evidently Lichtman has correctly and publicly predicted the popular vote winners in the last 7 presidential elections. I think he predicted Gore would win in 2000. He got the popular vote winner right, but not electoral college vote winner. Lichtman presents his methods in his early 1980s book, “The Keys to the White House.” Lichtman consulted with Volodia Keilis-Borok, and used a kernel discriminant analysis approach on election results from 1860-1980 as the training set. I think there is some argument as to scoring because Lichtman claims more than 7 successes. I guess he divided the data into a training and validation sets and w</p><p>6 0.96363616 <a title="1405-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-There_are_never_70_distinct_parameters.html">327 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-There are never 70 distinct parameters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  previous post , Andrew Wilson writes:
  
I agree we are in a really exciting time for statistics and machine learning.  There has been a lot of talk lately comparing machine learning with statistics.  I am curious whether you think there are many fundamental differences between the fields, or just superficial differences — different popular approximate inference methods, slightly different popular application areas, etc.  Is machine learning a subset of statistics?


In the paper we discuss how we think machine learning is fundamentally about pattern discovery, and ultimately, fully automating the learning and decision making process.  In other words, whatever a human does when he or she uses tools to analyze data, can be written down algorithmically and automated on a computer.  I am not sure if the ambitions are similar in statistics — and I don’t have any conventional statistics background, which makes it harder to tell. I think it’s an interesting discussion.</p><p>3 0.16009504 <a title="1297-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-04-Cool_one-day_miniconference_at_Columbia_Fri_12_Oct_on_computational_and_online_social_science.html">1481 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-04-Cool one-day miniconference at Columbia Fri 12 Oct on computational and online social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing we do here at the Applied Statistics Center is hold mini-conferences.  The next one looks really cool.  It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods. Together these advances have created an unprecedented opportunity to address longstanding questions in the social sciences, rang</p><p>4 0.14875716 <a title="1297-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-19-Everything_is_Obvious_%28once_you_know_the_answer%29.html">719 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-19-Everything is Obvious (once you know the answer)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Michael Graham Richard has  posted some great maps  from the 1932 Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States; the maps show how long it took to get to various places in the U.S. from New York City in 1800, 1830, 1857, and 1930. (I wonder if the atlas has one from around 1900 as well, that didn’t make it into the article? I’d like to see it, too, if it exists.)  Worth a look.

<p>Introduction: In a single day, New York City obtained two data analysis/statistics/machine learning organizations:
  
  Microsoft Research  New York City with  John Langford  (machine learning),  Duncan Watts  (networks), and  Dave Pennock  (algorithmic economics). 
  eBay technology center  focusing on data – led by  Chris Dixon , the co-founder of the recommendation engine company Hunch, which has recently been acquired by eBay. 
  
New York already has Facebook’s engineering  unit , Twitter’s East Coast  headquarters , and Google’s  second-largest  engineering office.
 
The data community here is on an upswing, and it might be one of the best places to be if you’re into applied statistics, machine learning or data analysis.

<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>3 0.86415648 <a title="1297-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-%E2%80%9CGenomics%E2%80%9D_vs._genetics.html">303 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-“Genomics” vs. genetics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>4 0.82951593 <a title="1297-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Of_forecasts_and_graph_theory_and_characterizing_a_statistical_method_by_the_information_it_uses.html">1214 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Of forecasts and graph theory and characterizing a statistical method by the information it uses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta points me to  “EigenBracket 2012: Using Graph Theory to Predict NCAA March Madness Basketball”  and writes, “I [Folta] have got to believe that he’s simply re-invented a statistical method in a graph-ish context, but don’t know enough to judge.”
 
I have not looked in detail at the method being presented here—I’m not much of college basketball fan—but I’d like to use this as an excuse to make one of my favorite general point, which is that a good way to characterize any statistical method is by what information it uses. 
   
The basketball ranking method here uses score differentials between teams in the past season.  On the plus side, that is better than simply using one-loss records (which (a) discards score differentials and (b) discards information on who played whom).  On the minus side, the method appears to be discretizing the scores (thus throwing away information on the exact score differential) and doesn’t use any external information such as external ratings.

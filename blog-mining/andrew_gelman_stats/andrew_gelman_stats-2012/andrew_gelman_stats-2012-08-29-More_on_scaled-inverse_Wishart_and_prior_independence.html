<p>Introduction: Since we’re  talking  about the scaled inverse Wishart . . . here’s a recent message from Chris Chatham:
 
I have been reading your book on Bayesian Hierarchical/Multilevel Modeling but have been struggling a bit with deciding whether to model my multivariate normal distribution using the scaled inverse Wishart approach you advocate given the arguments at  this blog post  [entitled "Why an inverse-Wishart prior may not be such a good idea"].
 
My reply:  We discuss this in our book.  We know the inverse-Wishart has problems, that’s why we recommend the  scaled  inverse-Wishart, which is a more general class of models.   Here ‘s an old blog post on the topic.  And also of course there’s the description in our book.
 
Chris pointed me to the following  comment  by Simon Barthelmé:
  
Using the scaled inverse Wishart doesn’t change anything, the standard deviations of the invidual coefficients and their covariance are still dependent.

While I am absolutely sympathetic to the Bayesian agenda I am often troubled by the requirement of having priors. We must have priors on the parameter of an infinite number of model we have never seen before and I find this troubling. There is a similarly troubling problem in economics of utility theory. Utility is on consumables. To be complete a consumer must assign utility to all sorts of things they never would have encountered. More recent versions of utility theory instead make consumption goods a portfolio of attributes. Cadillacs are x many units of luxury y of transport etc etc. And we can automatically have personal utilities to all these attributes.  


I don’t ever see parameters. Some model have few and some have hundreds. Instead, I see data. So I don’t know how to have an opinion on parameters themselves.

<p>Introduction: For awhile I’ve been fitting most of my multilevel models using lmer/glmer, which gives point estimates of the group-level variance parameters (maximum marginal likelihood estimate for lmer and an approximation for glmer).  I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.  Typically, when this happens, it’s not that we’re so sure the variance is close to zero or that the correlation is close to 1 or -1; rather, the marginal likelihood does not provide a lot of information about these parameters of the group-level error distribution.
 
I don’t want point estimates on the boundary.  I don’t want to say that the unexplained variance in some dimension is exactly zero.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog discussion revealed some confusion that I’ll try to resolve here.
 
I  wrote  that I’m not a big fan of subjective priors.  Various commenters had difficulty with this point, and I think the issue was most clearly stated by Bill Jeff re erys, who  wrote :
  
It seems to me that your prior has to reflect your subjective information before you look at the data. How can it not?


But this does not mean that the (subjective) prior that you choose is irrefutable; Surely a prior that reflects prior information just does not have to be inconsistent with that information. But that still leaves a range of priors that are consistent with it, the sort of priors that one would use in a sensitivity analysis, for example.
  
I think I see what Bill is getting at.  A prior represents your subjective belief, or some approximation to your subjective belief, even if it’s not perfect.  That sounds reasonable but I don’t think it works.  Or, at least, it often doesn’t work.

I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.

Marginally specified priors for nonparametric Bayesian estimation


Prior specification for nonparametric Bayesian inference involves the difficult task of quantifying prior knowledge about a parameter of high, often infinite, dimension. Realistically, a statistician is unlikely to have informed opinions about all aspects of such a parameter, but may have real information about functionals of the parameter, such the population mean or variance. This article proposes a new framework for nonparametric Bayes inference in which the prior distribution for a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter is decomposed into two parts: an informative prior on a finite set of functionals, and a nonparametric conditional prior for the parameter given the functionals. Such priors can be easily constructed from standard nonparametric prior distributions in common use, and inherit the large support of the standard priors upon which they are based.

<p>Introduction: Jouni Kerman did a cool bit of research justifying the Beta (1/3, 1/3) prior as noninformative for binomial data, and the Gamma (1/3, 0) prior for Poisson data.
 
You probably thought that nothing new could be said about noninformative priors in such basic problems, but you were wrong!
 
Here’s  the story :
  
The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had a couple of email conversations in the past couple days on dependence in multivariate prior distributions.
 
 Modeling the degrees of freedom and scale parameters in the t distribution 
 
First, in our Stan group we’ve been discussing the choice of priors for the degrees-of-freedom parameter in the t distribution.  I wrote that also there’s the question of parameterization.  It does not necessarily make sense to have independent priors on the df and scale parameters.  In some sense, the meaning of the scale parameter changes with the df.
 
 Prior dependence between correlation and scale parameters in the scaled inverse-Wishart model 
 
The second case of parameterization in prior distribution arose from an email I received from Chris Chatham pointing me to  this exploration  by Matt Simpson of the scaled inverse-Wishart prior distribution for hierarchical covariance matrices.  Simpson writes:
  
A popular prior for Σ is the inverse-Wishart distribution [ not  the same as the</p><p>2 0.96563035 <a title="1474-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-09-Default_priors_update%3F.html">846 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-09-Default priors update?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ryan King writes:
  
I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.

<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: 27. Which of the following problems were identified with the Burnham et al. survey of Iraq mortality? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) The survey used cluster sampling, which is inappropriate for estimating individual out- comes such as death.
 
(b) In their report, Burnham et al. did not identify their primary sampling units.
 
(c) The second-stage sampling was not a probability sample.
 
(d) Survey materials supplied by the authors are incomplete and inconsistent with published descriptions of the survey.

I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.

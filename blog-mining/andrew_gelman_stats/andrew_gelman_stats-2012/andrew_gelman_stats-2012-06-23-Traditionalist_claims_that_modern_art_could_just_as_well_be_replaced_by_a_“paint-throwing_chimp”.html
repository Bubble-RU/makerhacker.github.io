<p>Introduction: I saw  this excellent art show  the other day, and it reminded me how much artistic talent is out there.  I really have no idea whassup with those all-black canvases and the other stuff you see at modern art museums, given that there’s so much interesting new stuff being created every year.  I see a big difference between art made by people who feel they have something they want to say, compared to art being made by people who feel they are supposed to make art because they’re artists.

<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”

<p>Introduction: I opened the newspaper today (recall that this blog is on an approximately one-month delay) to see a moderately horrifying  story  about art appraisers who are deterred by fear of lawsuits from expressing an opinion about possible forgeries.
 
Maybe this trend will come to science too?  Perhaps Brett Pelham will sue Uri Simonsohn for the pain, suffering, and loss of income occurring from the  questioning of his Dennis the dentist paper ?  Or maybe I’ll be sued by some rogue sociologist for publicly questioning his data dredging?
 
Anyway, what amused me about the NYT article on art forgery was that two of the artists featured in the discussion were . . . Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein!  Warhol is famous for diluting the notion of the unique art object and for making works of art in a “Factory,” and Lichtenstein is famous for ripping off the style and imagery of comic book artists.  It’s funny for the two of them, of all people, to come up in a discussion of authenticity.

Any chance you could do a post explaining Popper’s propensity theory of probability?  I have never understood it.
  
My reply:  I’m a big fan of Popper (search this blog for details), especially as interpreted by Lakatos, but as far as I can tell, Popper’s theory of probability is hopeless.  We’ve made a lot of progress on probability in the past 75 years, and I don’t see any real need to go back to the bad old days.</p><p>6 0.15427683 <a title="1390-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-30-Real_rothko%2C_fake_rothko.html">1553 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-30-Real rothko, fake rothko</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  writes :
  
I know that in art, quality and value are two very different things.  Still, I had to stop and wonder when I read about

 
Domenico and Eleanore De Sole, who in 2004 paid $8.3 million for a painting attributed to Mark Rothko that they now say is a worthless fake.
 

One day a painting is worth $8.3 million; the next day, the same painting – same quality, same capacity to give aesthetic pleasure or do whatever it is that art does – is “worthless.”*  Art forgery also makes me wonder about the buyer’s motive.  If the buyer wanted only to have and to gaze upon something beautiful, something with artistic merit, then a fake Rothko is no different than a real Rothko.  It seems more likely that what the buyer wants is to own something valuable – i.e., something that costs a lot. Displaying your brokerage account statements is just too crude and obvious.  What the high-end art market offers is a kind of money laundering.

<p>Introduction: Hermann Goering is famous for two things:
 
1.  Being an air force general, and
 
2.  Being a really bad air force general.
 
What does this have to do, you may ask, with Jane Jacobs, who is famous for a book she wrote in the early 1960s advocating small, mixed-use street-level city development, in contrast to the mega-projects that were advocated by many influential planners at the time.
 
The connection is, as a London-based friend pointed out to me the other day, that the German bombing of London in WW2 knocked out random sections all over the city, which were then often replaced by various public developments.  The knocked-out portions were often small, so there was not always room for megablocks to replace them, and they were scattered—so the new housing was also distributed haphazardly all over the city.
 
Thus, Goering helped in two ways, corresponding to the two numbered points listed above:

<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95535165 <a title="1390-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist_claims_that_modern_art_could_just_as_well_be_replaced_by_a_%E2%80%9Cpaint-throwing_chimp%E2%80%9D.html">1390 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist claims that modern art could just as well be replaced by a “paint-throwing chimp”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

<p>Introduction: Michael Margolis writes:
  
What are we to make of it when a Metropolis-Hastings step just won’t tune? That is, the acceptance rate is zero at expected-jump-size X, and way above 1/2 at X-exp(-16) (i.e.,  machine precision ).


I’ve solved my practical problem by writing that I would have liked to include results from a diffuse prior, but couldn’t. But I’m bothered by the poverty of my intuition. And since everything I’ve read says this is an issue of efficiency, rather than accuracy, I wonder if I could solve it just by running massive and heavily thinned chains.
  
My reply:
 
I can’t see how this could happen in a well-specified problem!  I suspect it’s a bug.  Otherwise try rescaling your variables so that your parameters will have values on the order of magnitude of 1.
 
To which Margolis responded:
  
I hardly wrote any of the code, so I can’t speak to the bug question — it’s binomial kriging from the R package geoRglm. And there are no covariates to scale — just the zero and one</p><p>4 0.95428193 <a title="1390-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-05-Wouldn%E2%80%99t_it_be_cool_if_Glenn_Hubbard_were_consulting_for_Herbalife_and_I_were_on_the_other_side%3F.html">1708 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-05-Wouldn’t it be cool if Glenn Hubbard were consulting for Herbalife and I were on the other side?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I remember in 4th grade or so, the teacher would give us a list of vocabulary words each week and we’d have to show we learned them by using each in a sentence.  We quickly got bored and decided to do the assignment by writing a single sentence using all ten words.  (Which the teacher hated, of course.)
 
The above headline is in that spirit, combining  blog   posts  rather than vocabulary words.
 
But that only uses two of the entries.  To really do the job, I’d need to throw in bivariate associations, ecological fallacies, high-dimensional feature selection, statistical significance, the suddenly unpopular name Hilary, snotty reviewers, the contagion of obesity, and milk-related spam.
 
Or we could bring in some of the all-time favorites, such as Bayesians, economists, Finland, beautiful parents and their daughters, goofy graphics, red and blue states, essentialism in children’s reasoning, chess running, and zombies.

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.

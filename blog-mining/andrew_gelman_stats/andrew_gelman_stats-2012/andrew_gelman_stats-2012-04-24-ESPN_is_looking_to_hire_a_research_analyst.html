ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: From  CNN :
  

In July, KDNuggets.com, an online newsite focused on data mining and analytics software, ran an unusual listing in its jobs section: 
 “We are looking for Predictive Modeling/Data Mining Scientists and Analysts, at both the senior and junior level, to join our department through November 2012 at our Chicago Headquarters,”  read the ad.  “We are a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians, predictive modelers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software developers, general analysts and organizers – all striving for a single goal: re-electing President Obama.” 


Users of the  Obama 2012 – Are You In?  app are not only giving the campaign personal data like their name, gender, birthday, current city, religion and political views, they are sharing their list of friends and information those friends share, like their birthday, current city, religion and political views.

My [Cohen's] firm is looking for strong candidates to help us in developing software and analyzing data using Bayesian methods.


We have been developing a suite of programs in C++ which allow us to do Bayesian hierarchical regression and logit/probit models on marketing data. These efforts have included the use of high performance computing tools like nVidia’s CUDA and the new OpenCL standard, which allow parallel processing of Bayesian models. Our software is very, very fast – even on databases that are ½ terabyte in size. The software still needs many additions and improvements and a person with the right skill set will have the chance to make a significant contribution.

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.


We invite applications from both new and experienced Ph.Ds, and women and underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

<p>Introduction: In a single day, New York City obtained two data analysis/statistics/machine learning organizations:
  
  Microsoft Research  New York City with  John Langford  (machine learning),  Duncan Watts  (networks), and  Dave Pennock  (algorithmic economics). 
  eBay technology center  focusing on data – led by  Chris Dixon , the co-founder of the recommendation engine company Hunch, which has recently been acquired by eBay. 
  
New York already has Facebook’s engineering  unit , Twitter’s East Coast  headquarters , and Google’s  second-largest  engineering office.
 
The data community here is on an upswing, and it might be one of the best places to be if you’re into applied statistics, machine learning or data analysis.

<p>Introduction: After posting that  announcement  about Civis Analytics, I wrote, “If a reconstituted Romney Analytics team is hiring, let me know and I’ll post that ad too.”  Adam Schaeffer  obliged :
  

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.

Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.

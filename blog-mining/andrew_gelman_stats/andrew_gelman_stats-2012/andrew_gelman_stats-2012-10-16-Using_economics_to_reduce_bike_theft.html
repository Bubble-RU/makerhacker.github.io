At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
An Oregon legislator, Mitch Greenlick, has  proposed to make it illegal  in Oregon to carry a child under six years old on one’s bike (including in a child seat) or in a bike trailer.  The guy says “”We’ve just done a study showing that 30 percent of riders biking to work at least three days a week have some sort of crash that leads to an injury… When that’s going on out there, what happens when you have a four year old on the back of a bike?”  The study is from Oregon Health Sciences University, at which the legislator is a professor. 
 
Greenlick also says “”If it’s true that it’s unsafe, we have an obligation to protect people. If I thought a law would save one child’s life, I would step in and do it. Wouldn’t you?”
 
There are two statistical issues here.  The first is in the category of “lies, damn lies, and statistics,” and involves the statement about how many riders have injuries.  As quoted on  a blog ,  the author of the study in question says th</p><p>5 0.19513391 <a title="1536-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-%E2%80%A6pretty_soon_you%E2%80%99re_talking_real_money..html">68 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-…pretty soon you’re talking real money.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  New York Times article  reports the opening of a half-mile section of bike path, recently built along the west side of Manhattan at a cost of $16M, or roughly $30 million per mile.  That’s about $5700 per linear foot.  Kinda sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?   
 
Well, $30 million per mile for about one car-lane mile is a lot, but it’s not out of line compared to other urban highway construction costs.  The Doyle Drive project in San Francisco — a freeway to replace the current old and deteriorating freeway approach to the Golden Gate Bridge — is currently under way at $1 billion for 1.6 miles…but hey, it will have six lanes each way, so that isn’t so bad, at $50 million per lane-mile.  And there are other components to the project, too, not just building the highway (there will also be bike paths, landscaping, on- and off-ramps, and so on).  All in all it seems roughly in line with the New York bike lane project.

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV.

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar  writes :
  
While bike theft is an epidemic in major US cities, most people seem resigned that it’s just a fact of life. . . . at Priceonomics, we thought we’d take a crack at trying to reduce bike theft. Could we use software to help people fight back against bike thieves?


Professional bike thieves exist because they can make a profit. Luckily, this author went to business school and remembers exactly one equation from the experience:


Profit = Revenue – Cost


From a criminal’s perspective, the “Cost” of bike theft is about zero. The odds of getting caught are negligible and the penalty is about zero as well. Most commentators suggest that in order to prevent bike theft, the government should increase the penalties to make it a less attractive crime. As we stated earlier, we somehow doubt government intervention is going to happen any time soon.


We decided to focus on the revenue half of the equation. Could we make it harder for bike thieves to turn their contraband</p><p>2 0.99019724 <a title="1536-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-23-Examples_of_the_use_of_hierarchical_modeling_to_generalize_to_new_settings.html">1425 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-23-Examples of the use of hierarchical modeling to generalize to new settings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a link to our  back-and-forth  on causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings, Elias Bareinboim (a computer scientist who is working with Judea Pearl)  writes :
  
In the past week, I have been engaged in a discussion with Andrew Gelman and his blog readers regarding causal inference, selection bias, confounding, and generalizability. I was trying to understand how his method which he calls “hierarchical modeling” would handle these issues and what guarantees it provides. . . . If anyone understands how “hierarchical modeling” can solve a simple toy problem (e.g., M-bias, control of confounding, mediation, generalizability), please share with us.
  
In his post, Bareinboim raises a direct question about hierarchical modeling and also indirectly brings up larger questions about what is convincing evidence when evaluating a statistical method.

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>4 0.98977864 <a title="1536-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-02-Graphical_communication_for_legal_scholarship.html">1096 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-02-Graphical communication for legal scholarship</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following  my talk  on infovis and statistical graphics at the  Empirical Legal Studies conference , Dan Kahan writes:
  
The legal academy, which is making strides toward sensible integration of a variety of empirical methods into its scholarship, is horribly ignorant of the utility of graphic reporting of data, a likely influence of the formative influence that econometric methods has exerted on expectations and habits of mind among legal scholars. Lee Epstein has written a pair of wonderful articles on graphic reporting –

I have followed your thoughts on plagiarism rather closely, and I ran across something in the Economics literature that I felt might interest you (and if you were to share this, I’d rather remain anonymous as a junior faculty not looking to step on toes anywhere).  I know you aren’t the plagiarism police, but figured you would have some input.


I’ve been reading up on some literature regarding all-pay auctions for some research I have been working on and came across an interesting paper in J. Political Economy (1998) with the following intro:

 
“Many economic allocations are decided by competition for a prize on the basis of costly activities. For example, monopoly licenses may be awarded to the person (or group) that lobbies the hardest (Tullock, 1967), or tickets may be given to those who wait in line the longest (Holt and Sherman 1982). In such contests, losers’ efforts are costly and are generally not compensated.

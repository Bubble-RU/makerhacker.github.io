Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author.

</p><p>3 What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light? [sent-5, score-0.558]
</p><p>4 The example    Basbøll’s discussion arose out of a case I  posted  the other day, not an example I was personally aware of but an instance of minor plagiarism that someone sent in to me in unofficial role as “not the plagiarism police. [sent-18, score-1.217]
</p><p>5 ”  My post elicited a range of comments, with some people saying that the published paper should be corrected to make the sourcing more clear, and others saying that the copying was no big deal. [sent-19, score-0.284]
</p><p>6 Several hours after my entry had been posted, I received a friendly email from one of the authors of the article:     Just want to set things right: our paper is an experimental test of the JPE modeling paper. [sent-22, score-0.403]
</p><p>7 And so I would change my above “it does seem a bit tacky” sentence to: “It seems like a mistake to not use quotation marks, even in a case such as this where the work is clearly labeled as following up from an earlier paper. [sent-31, score-0.391]
</p><p>8 ”    I did not say that the unsourced quotation was not plagiarism, but I felt that it was not such a problem, hence I felt that the email I’d received had cleared things up. [sent-32, score-0.636]
</p><p>9 That said, just as I am not the plagiarism police, I’m not the plagiarism arbiter, and me saying it’s ok doesn’t make it ok. [sent-33, score-0.972]
</p><p>10 Perhaps one problem is the analogy of plagiarism to theft. [sent-35, score-0.511]
</p><p>11 Instead, maybe we should analogize plagiarism to breaking a dish, which it’s possible to do by accident or even unknowingly via sloppy behavior (I say this as someone who is sloppy and breaks things sometimes). [sent-39, score-0.901]
</p><p>12 If I break a dish, I feel bad and I apologize, but I don’t feel like a bad person, I just see it as part of the cost of doing business, given my general level of obliviousness. [sent-40, score-0.299]
</p><p>13 When I received that email, I felt bad, in that I had singled out these authors (although not mentioning them by name, but that was not hard to find via google). [sent-43, score-0.256]
</p><p>14 Several months ago I had an unrelated instance of a blog post that annoyed someone who sent me an obnoxious cease-and-desist style email. [sent-46, score-0.367]
</p><p>15 For example, Mark Hauser didn’t share his data, then denied and denied, even when his own lab assistants were telling their stories. [sent-49, score-0.304]
</p><p>16 Ed Wegman did a Chris Rock and denied even after the evidence was obvious, and he also threw a former student under the bus, even though there were several instances of plagiarism in Wegman-authored publications not involving that student. [sent-51, score-0.705]
</p><p>17 Karl Weick, when is plagiarism was uncovered, bobbed and weaved, got cute, and never apologized or explained. [sent-52, score-0.585]
</p><p>18 In the example discussed above the authors seem reasonable (hey, one of them sent me a nice email), and after all they did cite the earlier article 8 times. [sent-54, score-0.335]
</p><p>19 Self-plagiarism isn’t as bad as real plagiarism, and Frey did in fact apologized (and it was a real apology, not a non-apology apology of the form, “I’m sorry there was something I did that led to a perception of wrongdoing” etc). [sent-61, score-0.488]
</p><p>20 Hence I felt the larger problem was not with these particular people but rather with the lack of general agreement that researchers have a duty to share data and methods where possible. [sent-70, score-0.339]

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>5 0.24732205 <a title="1588-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-15-Things_we_do_on_sabbatical_instead_of_actually_working.html">345 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-15-Things we do on sabbatical instead of actually working</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  news article  by Eli Kintisch with the following wonderful quote:
  
Will Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who questions the consensus view on climate, thinks Mashey is a destructive force who uses “totalitarian tactics”–publishing damaging documents online, without peer review–to carry out personal vendettas.
  
I’ve never thought of uploading files as “totalitarian” but maybe they do things differently at Princeton.  I actually think of totalitarians as acting secretly–denunciations without evidence, midnight arrests, trials in undisclosed locations, and so forth.  Mashey’s practice of putting everything out in the open seems to me the opposite of totalitarian.
 
The article also reports that Edward Wegman’s lawyer said that Wegman “has never engaged in plagiarism.”  If I were the lawyer, I’d be pretty mad at Wegman at this point.  I can just imagine the conversation:

<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  points  to an excellent rant from Peter Moskos, trashing a study about “food deserts” (which I kept reading as “food desserts”) in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Here’s Moskos:
  
From the Times:

 
There is no relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents. 


Within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood, “you can get basically any type of food,” said Roland Sturm of the RAND Corporation, lead author of one of the studies. “Maybe we should call it a food swamp rather than a desert,” he said.
 

Sure thing, Sturm. But I suspect you wouldn’t think certain neighborhoods are swamped with good food if you actually got out of your office and went to one of the neighborhoods. After all, what are going to believe: A nice data set or your lying eyes?


“Food outlet data … are classifıed using the North American Industry Classifıcation System (NAICS)” (p. 130).

<p>Introduction: Mark Grote writes: 
  
  
I’d like to request general feedback and references for a problem of combining disparate data sources in a regression model. We’d like to model log crop yield as a function of environmental predictors, but the observations come from many data sources and are peculiarly structured. Among the issues are:


1. Measurement precision in predictors and outcome varies widely with data sources. Some observations are in very coarse units of measurement, due to rounding or even observer guesswork. 


2. There are obvious clusters of observations arising from studies in which crop yields were monitored over successive years in spatially proximate communities. Thus some variables may be constant within clusters–this is true even for log yield, probably due to rounding of similar yields. 


3. Cluster size and intra-cluster association structure (temporal, spatial or both) vary widely across the dataset.

<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader.

<p>Introduction: I read  this article  by Rivka Galchen on quantum computing.  Much of the article was about an eccentric scientist in his fifties named David Deutch.  I’m sure the guy is brilliant but I wasn’t particularly interested in his not particularly interesting life story (apparently he’s thin and lives in Oxford).  There was a brief description of quantum computing itself, which reminds me of the discussion we had a couple years ago under the heading,  The laws of conditional probability are false  (and the update  here ).
 
I don’t have anything new to say here; I’d just never heard of quantum computing before and it seemed relevant to our discussion.  The uncertainty inherent in quantum computing seems closely related to Jouni’s idea of  fully Bayesian computing , that uncertainty should be inherent in the computational structure rather than tacked on at the end.

<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.

<p>Introduction: “Explanation” is this thing that social scientists (or people in their everyday lives, acting like social scientists) do, where some event X happens and we supply a coherent story that concludes with X.  Sometimes we speak of an event as “overdetermined,” when we can think of many plausible stories that all lead to X.
 
My question today is:  what is explanation, in a statistical sense?
 
To understand why this is a question worth asking at all, compare to prediction.  Prediction is another thing that we all to, typically in a qualitative fashion:  I think she’s gonna win this struggle, I think he’s probably gonna look for a new job, etc.  It’s pretty clear how to map everyday prediction into a statistical framework, and we can think of informal qualitative predictions as approximations to the predictions that could be made by a statistical model (as in the  classic work  of Meehl and others on clinical vs. statistical prediction).

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas  writes :
  
After reading the  Fowler/Christakis paper on networks and obesity , a student asked why it was that friends had a stronger influence on spouses. In other words, if we believe the F&C; paper, they report that your friends (57%) are more likely to transmit obesity than your spouse (37%) (see page 370).


This might be interpreted in two ways. First, it might be seen as a counter argument. This might really indicate that homophily is at work. We probably select spouses for some traits that are not self-similar. While we choose friends mainly on self-similarity of leisure and consumption (e.g, diet and exercise). Second, there might be an explanation based on transmission. We choose friends because we want them to influence us, while spouses are (supposed?) to accept us.


Your thoughts?
  
My thought:  No.  No no no no no.  No no no.  No.
 
From the linked paper:
  
A person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if h</p><p>4 0.221176 <a title="1282-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-06-Choose_your_default%2C_or_your_default_will_choose_you_%28election_forecasting_edition%29.html">1564 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-06-Choose your default, or your default will choose you (election forecasting edition)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Statistics is the science of defaults.
 
One of the differences between statistics and other branches of engineering is that we have a special love for default procedures, perhaps because so many statistical problems are routine (or, at least, people would like them to be).  We have standard estimates for all sorts of models, books of statistical tests, and default settings for everything.  Recently I’ve been working on default weakly informative priors (which are  not  the same as the typically noninformative “reference priors” of the Bayesian literature).  From a Bayesian point of view, the appropriate default procedure could be defined as that which is appropriate for the population of problems that one might be studying.
 
More generally, much of our job as statisticians is to come up with methods that will be used by others in routine practice.  (Much of the rest of our job is to come up with methods for evaluating new and existing statistical methods, and methods for coming up wi</p><p>5 0.19910824 <a title="1282-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-09-Advice%3A__positive-sum%2C_zero-sum%2C_or_negative-sum.html">2287 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-09-Advice:  positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there. I offer some of it myself!  As I’ve written before (see  this post from 2008  reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and  this post from 2010  reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
It’s time to play the game again.  This time it’s  advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas  for Ph.D. students.  I’ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum: 
  
  
1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up. 
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride. 
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication.

<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>3 0.77528435 <a title="1282-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-26-If_statistics_is_so_significantly_great%2C_why_don%E2%80%99t_statisticians_use_statistics%3F.html">51 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-26-If statistics is so significantly great, why don’t statisticians use statistics?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve recently decided that statistics lies at the intersection of measurement, variation, and comparison.  (I need to use some cool  Venn-diagram-drawing software  to show this.)  I’ll argue this one another time–my claim is that, to be “statistics,” you need all three of these elements, no two will suffice-.
 
My point here, though, is that as statisticians, we teach  all  of these three things and talk about how important they are (and often criticize/mock others for selection bias and other problems that arise from not recognizing the difficulties of good measurement, attention to variation, and focused comparisons), but in our own lives (in deciding how to teach and do research, administration, and service–not to mention our personal lives), we think about these issues  almost not at all .  In our classes, we almost never use standardized tests, let alone the sort of before-after measurements we recommend to others.  We do not evaluate our plans systematically nor do we typically e</p><p>4 0.76477158 <a title="1282-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Philosophy_of_Bayesian_statistics%3A__my_reactions_to_Wasserman.html">1165 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Philosophy of Bayesian statistics:  my reactions to Wasserman</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Larry Wasserman, “Low Assumptions, High Dimensions”:
 
This article was refreshing to me because it was so different from anything I’ve seen before.  Larry works in a statistics department and I work in a statistics department but there’s so little overlap in what we do.  Larry and I both work in high dimesions (maybe his dimensions are higher than mine, but a few thousand dimensions seems like a lot to me!), but there the similarity ends.  His article is all about using few to no assumptions, while I use assumptions all the time.  Here’s an example.  Larry writes:
  
P. Laurie Davies (and his co-workers) have written several interesting papers where probability models, at least in the sense that we usually use them, are eliminated. Data are treated as deterministic. One then looks for adequate models rather than true mode</p><p>5 0.7525537 <a title="1282-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-19-David_Blackwell.html">155 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-19-David Blackwell</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Blackwell was already retired by the time I came to Berkeley, and probably our closest connection was that I taught the class in decision theory that he used to teach.  I enjoyed that class a lot, partly because it took me out of my usual comfort zone of statistical inference and data analysis toward something more theoretical and mathematical.  Blackwell was one of the legendary figures in the department at that time and was also one of the most tolerant of alternative approaches to statistics, perhaps because of combination of a mathematical background, applied research in the war and after (which I learned about in  this recent obituary ), and personal experiences,
 
Blackwell may be best known in statistics for the  Rao-Blackwell theorem .  Rao, of course, is also famoust for the Cramer-Rao lower bound.  Both theorems relate to minimum-variance statistical estimators.
 
Here’s a quote from Thomas (Jesus’s dad) Ferguson in Blackwell’s  obituary :

<p>Introduction: I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I’d share an old story.
 
About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>2 0.97018456 <a title="1282-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>same-blog 5 0.94538212 <a title="1282-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-26-Bad_news_about_%28some%29_statisticians.html">1282 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-26-Bad news about (some) statisticians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sociologist Fabio Rojas  reports  on “a conversation I [Rojas] have had a few times with statisticians”:
  
Rojas:  “What does your research tell us about a sample of, say, a few hundred cases?”


Statistician: “That’s not important. My result works as n–> 00.”


Rojas: “Sure, that’s a fine mathematical result, but I have to estimate the model with, like, totally finite data. I need inference, not limits. Maybe the estimate doesn’t work out so well for small n.”


Statistician: “Sure, but if you have a few million cases, it’ll work in the limit.”


Rojas: “Whoa. Have you ever collected, like, real world network data? A million cases is hard to get.”
  
The conversation continues in this frustrating vein.  Rojas writes:
  
This illustrates a fundamental issue in statistics (and other sciences). One you formalize a model and work mathematically, you are tempted to focus on what is mathematically interesting instead of the underlying problem motivating the science. . . .

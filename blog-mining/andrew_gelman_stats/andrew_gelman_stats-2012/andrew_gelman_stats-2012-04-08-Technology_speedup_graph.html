<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.11149628 <a title="1253-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-21-Kahan_on_Pinker_on_politics.html">1633 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-21-Kahan on Pinker on politics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reacting to my recent  post  on Steven Pinker’s too-broad (in my opinion) speculations on red and blue states, Dan “cultural cognition” Kahan  writes :
  
 Pinker is clearly right to note that mass political opinions on seemingly diverse issues cohere, and Andrew, I think, is way too quick to challenge this 


I [Kahan] could cite to billions of interesting papers, but I’ll just show you what I mean instead. A recent CCP data collection involving a nationally representative on-line sample of 1750 subjects included a module that asked the subjects to indicate on a six-point scale “how strongly . . . you support or oppose” a collection of policies:  


policy_gun  Stricter gun control laws in the United States. 
policy_healthcare  Universal health care. 
policy_taxcut  Raising income taxes for persons in the highest-income tax bracket. 
policy_affirmative action  Affirmative action for minorities. 
policy_warming  Stricter carbon emission standards to reduce global warming.

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>5 0.10013615 <a title="1253-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-10-Do_you_believe_that_%E2%80%9Chumans_and_other_living_things_have_evolved_over_time%E2%80%9D%3F.html">2167 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-10-Do you believe that “humans and other living things have evolved over time”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day on the sister blog we  discussed  a recent Pew Research survey that seemed to show that Republicans are becoming more partisan about evolution (or, as Paul Krugman put it, “So what happened after 2009 that might be driving Republican views? . . . Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”).
 
We presented some discussion and evidence from Dan Kahan suggesting that the evidence for such a change was not so clear at all.  Kahan drew his conclusions from a more detailed analysis of the much-discussed Pew data, along with a comparison to a recent Gallup poll.
 
Also following up on this is sociologist David Wealiem, who pulls some more data into the discussion:

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).
  
I agree that (a) the graph could be improved in small ways–in particular, adding half-year data seems like a great idea–and (b) it’s a wonderful, wonderful graph as is.

<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.

<p>Introduction: After seeing  this graph :
 
   
 
I have the following message for Sharad:
 
Rotate the graph 90 degrees so you can see the words.  Also you can ditch the lines.  Then what you have is a dotplot, following the principles of Cleveland (1985).  You can lay out a few on one page to see some interactions with demographics.
 
 The real challenge here . . . 
 
. . . is to automate this sort of advice.  Or maybe we just need a really nice dotplot() function and enough examples, and people will start doing it?
 
 P.S. 
 
Often a lineplot is better.

<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein asks what I think of  this :
 
   
 
My reply:
 
It’s hard for me to imagine a compelling reason for anyone to go to London, Ontario–but, hey, I guess there’s all kinds of people in this world! More seriously, I see the appeal of the graph but it’s a bit busy for my taste.  Over the years I’ve moved toward small multiples rather than single busy graphs.  That’s one reason why I prefer Tufte’s second book to his first book.  The Napoleon-in-Russia graph is a bad model, in that inspires people to try to cram lots of variables on a single graph.

I [Dan] like it as a travel planning graph, it gives you what you want to know (how how will the days be, how cold will the nights be, will it rain) but is a bit easier on the brain than a table of highs and lows. Also makes it easy to see the trend.

I just wanted to alert to this completely misinformed Politico article by Roger Simon, equating sampling theory with “magic.” Normally, I wouldn’t send you this, but I sent him a helpful email and he was a complete jerk about it.
  
Wow—this is really bad. It’s so bad I refuse to link to it. I don’t know who this dude is, but it’s pitiful. Andy Rooney could do better. And I don’t mean Andy Rooney in his prime, I mean Andy Rooney right now. The piece appears to be an attempt at jocularity, but it’s about 10 million times worse than whatever the worst thing is that Dave Barry has ever written.

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Kaul wrotes:
  
By statute (“the least burdensome” pathway), the approval standard for devices by the US FDA is lower than for drugs. Before a new drug can be marketed, the sponsor must show “substantial evidence of effectiveness” as based on two or more well-controlled clinical studies (which literally means 2 trials, each with a p value of <0.05, or 1 large trial with a robust p value <0.00125). In contrast, the sponsor of a new device, especially those that are designated as high-risk (Class III) device, need only demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to an FDA-approved device via the 510(k) exemption or a "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness", evaluated through a pre-market approval and typically based on a single study.


What does “reasonable assurance” or “substantial equivalence” imply to you as a Bayesian? These are obviously qualitative constructs, but if one were to quantify them, how would you go about addressing it?

<p>Introduction: Responding to a proposal to move the journal Political Analysis from double-blind to single-blind reviewing (that is, authors would not know who is reviewing their papers but reviewers would know the authors’ names), Tom Palfrey writes:
  
I agree with the editors’ recommendation. I have served on quite a few editorial boards of journals with different blinding policies, and have seen no evidence that double blind procedures are a useful way to improve the quality of articles published in a journal. Aside from the obvious administrative nuisance and the fact that authorship anonymity is a thing of the past in our discipline, the theoretical and empirical arguments in both directions lead to an ambiguous conclusion. Also keep in mind that the editors know the identity of the authors (they need to know for practical reasons), their identity is not hidden from authors, and ultimately it is they who make the accept/reject decision, and also lobby their friends and colleagues to submit “the</p><p>5 0.93377972 <a title="1253-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-05-Glenn_Hubbard_and_I_were_on_opposite_sides_of_a_court_case_and_I_didn%E2%80%99t_even_know_it%21.html">1707 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-05-Glenn Hubbard and I were on opposite sides of a court case and I didn’t even know it!</a></p>

Glenn Hubbard, Leading Academic and Mitt Romney Advisor, Took $1200 an Hour to Be Countrywide’s Expert Witness . . . Hidden among the reams of material recently filed in connection with the lawsuit of monoline insurer MBIA against Bank of America and Countrywide is a deposition of none other than Columbia University’s Glenn Hubbard. . . . Hubbard testified on behalf of Countrywide in the MBIA suit. He conducted an “analysis” that essentially concluded that Countrywide’s loans weren’t any worse than the loans produced by other mortgage originators, and that therefore the monstrous losses that investors in those loans suffered were due to other factors related to the economic crisis – and not caused by the serial misrepresentations and fraud in Countrywide’s underwriting.

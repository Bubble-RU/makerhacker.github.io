<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>3 0.1578704 <a title="1097-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.15397087 <a title="1097-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Unhappy_with_improvement_by_a_factor_of_10%5E29.html">160 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Unhappy with improvement by a factor of 10^29</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have an optimization problem:  I have a complicated physical model that predicts energy and thermal behavior of a building, given the values of a slew of parameters, such as insulation effectiveness, window transmissivity, etc.  I’m trying to find the parameter set that best fits several weeks of thermal and energy use data from the real building that we modeled. (Of course I would rather explore parameter space and come up with probability distributions for the parameters, and maybe that will come later, but for now I’m just optimizing).  To do the optimization, colleagues and I implemented a “particle swarm optimization” algorithm on a massively parallel machine. This involves giving each of about 120 “particles” an initial position in parameter space, then letting them move around, trying to move to better positions according to a specific algorithm.  We gave each particle an initial position sampled from our prior distribution for each parameter.  So far we’ve run about 140 itera</p><p>5 0.14605609 <a title="1097-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-29-Where_36%25_of_all_boys_end_up_nowadays.html">1697 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-29-Where 36% of all boys end up nowadays</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Leslie McCall spoke in the sociology department here the other day to discuss changes in attitudes about income inequality as well as changes in attitudes about attitudes about income inequality.  (That is, she talked about what survey respondents say, and she talked about what scholars have said about what survey respondents say.)
 
On the plus side, the talk was interesting.  On the downside, I had to leave right at the start of the discussion so I didn’t have a chance to ask my questions.  So I’m placing them below.
 
I can’t find a copy of McCall’s slides so I’ll link to  this recent op-ed  she wrote on the topic of “Rising Wealth Inequality: Should We Care?”  Her title was “Americans Aren’t Naive,” and she wrote:
  
Understanding what Americans think about rising income inequality has been hampered by three problems.

<p>Introduction: From my  New York Times blog  today, here’s an example of how contemporaneous poll results can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
 
Recently in the New Republic,  William Galston  shared some recent findings from Gallup:
  
Respondents were asked to categorize three economic objectives as extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not important. Here’s what they said:


Extremely/very important          Somewhat/not important


Grow and expand the economy                                         82                                            18


Increase equality of opportunity for people to get ahead                                             70                                            30


Reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and the poor                                  46                                            54

<p>Introduction: Psychology is a universal science of human nature, whereas political science is centered on the study of particular historical events and trends.  Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that when a psychologist looks at politics, he presents ideas that are thought-provoking but are too general to quite work.  This is fine; political scientists can then take such ideas and try to adapt them more closely to particular circumstances.
 
The psychologist I’m thinking about here is Steven Pinker, who, in  writes  the following on the question, “Why Are States So Red and Blue?”:
  
But why do ideology and geography cluster so predictably?

<p>Introduction: Respected political scientist Tim Groseclose just came out with a book, “Left Turn:  How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.”  I was familiar with Groseclose’s article (with Jeffrey Milyo) on media bias that came out several years ago–it was an interesting study but I was not convinced by its central claim that they were measuring an absolute level of bias–and then recently heard about this new book in the context of some  intemperate  things Groseclose said in a interview on the conservative Fox TV network.
 
Groseclose’s big conclusion is that in the absence of media bias, the average American voter would be positioned at around 25 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is a right-wing Republican and 100 is a left-wing Democrat.  (Seeing as the number line is conventionally drawn from left to right, I think it would make more sense for 0 to represent the left and 100 to be on the right, but I guess it’s too late for him to change now.)  Groseclose places the average voter now at around</p><p>6 0.75931823 <a title="1097-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling_different_claims_about_working-class_voters.html">1385 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling different claims about working-class voters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After quoting from a speech where a Republican presidential candidate praises the space program, Mark Palko  writes :
  
I [Palko] don’t know what the reaction of the crowd was (the reporting wasn’t that detailed) but I’d imagine it was friendly. You can usually get a warm response from a Republican crowd by coming out in favor of manned space exploration which is, when you think about, strange as hell.


If you set out to genetically engineer a program that libertarians ought to object to, you’d probably come up with something like the manned space program. A massive government initiative, tremendously expensive, with no real role for individual initiative. Compared to infrastructure projects the benefits to business are limited. . . . There have been efforts in libertarian-leaning organs (The Wall Street Journal, Reason, John Tierney’s NYT columns) trying to argue that interplanetary exploration can be done on the cheap. These usually rely heavily on the blatant low-balling of Robert</p><p>2 0.96919113 <a title="1097-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-18-Those_mean_psychologists%2C_making_fun_of_dodgy_research%21.html">1329 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-18-Those mean psychologists, making fun of dodgy research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two people separately sent me  this amusing mock-research paper  by Brian A. Nosek (I assume that’s what’s meant by “Arina K. Bones”).  The article is pretty funny, but  this poster  (by Nosek and Samuel Gosling) is even better!  Check it out:
 
   
 
   
 
I remarked that this was almost as good as my zombies paper, and my correspondent pointed me to  this page  of (I assume) Nosek’s research on aliens.
 
P.S.  I clicked through to take  the test  to see if I’m dead or alive, but I got bored after a few minutes.  I gotta say, if Gosling can  come up with  a 10-item measure of the Big Five, this crew should be able to come up with a reasonably valid alive-or-dead test that doesn’t require dozens and dozens of questions!</p><p>3 0.96733809 <a title="1097-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-30-%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_at_least_as_much_as_an_80_percent_chance_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">982 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-30-“There’s at least as much as an 80 percent chance . . .”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  points  to the above self-canceling statement which comes from a quantitatively-trained  expert  on international debt.  I can only assume that he was speaking quickly and that the reporter didn’t know enough to ask him to clarify.  When I’m interviewed, I emit a lot of ums, uhs, and probably quite a few meaningless remarks, but usually whoever is interviewing me knows to just keep the good stuff.  As Kaiser points out, the above quote could mean two completely opposite things!  In context I’m sure it was clear to the speaker but it’s not at all obvious what’s going on in the published version.  Again, I’m not blaming the expert here, it’s just a miscommunication that got into the article, something that Kaiser noticed (and that I care about) because of our interest in probability communication.
 
In any case, the line “at least as much as an 80 percent chance” should join “ But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable ” in the Probability Hall</p><p>4 0.96166408 <a title="1097-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-29-How_to_grab_power_in_a_democracy_%E2%80%93_in_5_easy_non-violent_steps.html">116 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-29-How to grab power in a democracy – in 5 easy non-violent steps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past decades violent means of grabbing power have been discredited and internationally regulated. Still, grabbing power is as desired as it has always been, and I’d like to introduce some new methods used today:
  
 Establish your base of power by achieving a critical mass (75%+) within a group with a  high barrier to entry . Examples of barriers to entry: genetics (familiar ties, skin, eye color, hair type – takes 2+ generations to enter), religion (takes 2-10 years to enter), language (very hard to enter after the age of 10). 
 Encourage your followers to have  many children  – because of common ethical concerns, other groups will help you bring them up. 
 Control the system of  indoctrination , such as religious schooling, government-based educational system, entertainment, popular culture – limiting the loss of children to out-group (only needed for non-genetic barriers to entry). 
  Wait 18 years  for your followers’ children to become eligible to vote. 
  Win elections  by</p><p>5 0.9568882 <a title="1097-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-23-Combining_survey_data_obtained_using_different_modes_of_sampling.html">777 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-23-Combining survey data obtained using different modes of sampling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m involved (with Irv Garfinkel and others) in a planned survey of New York City residents.  It’s hard to reach people in the city–not everyone will answer their mail or phone, and you can’t send an interviewer door-to-door in a locked apartment building.  (I think it violates IRB to have a plan of pushing all the buzzers by the entrance and hoping someone will let you in.)  So the plan is to use multiple modes, including phone, in person household, random street intercepts and mail.
 
The question then is how to combine these samples.  My suggested approach is to divide the population into poststrata based on various factors (age, ethnicity, family type, housing type, etc), then to pool responses within each poststratum, then to runs some regressions including postratsta and also indicators for mode, to understand how respondents from different modes differ, after controlling for the demographic/geographic adjustments.
 
Maybe this has already been done and written up somewhere?

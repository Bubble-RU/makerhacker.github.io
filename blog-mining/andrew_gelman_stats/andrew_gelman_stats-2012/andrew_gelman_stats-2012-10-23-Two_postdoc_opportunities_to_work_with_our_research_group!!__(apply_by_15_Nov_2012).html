<p>Introduction: The economy isn’t going so well, but there are some interesting possibilities here at Columbia University.  One such option that you should be thinking about is the  Earth Institute Fellowship , which pays well, includes a research stipend, and puts you in an exciting interdisciplinary community of faculty and postdoctoral researchers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia brings in several postdocs each year–it’s a two-year gig–and some of them have been statisticians (recently, Kenny Shirley and Leontine Alkema).  We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health.  It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.  The EI postdoc can be a place to do interesting work and begin a research career.

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.


We invite applications from both new and experienced Ph.Ds, and women and underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>6 0.14875349 <a title="1545-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-25-Postdoc_position_on_psychometrics_and_network_modeling.html">2113 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-25-Postdoc position on psychometrics and network modeling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Francis Tuerlinckx announces that he and Denny Borsboom have a joint postdoctoral position.  It sounds really cool:
  
The position is in the Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences at the University of Leuven (Belgium) and involves frequent travel to and contact with the Psychological Methods group in Amsterdam.


The research of the postdoc will be part of a larger program aimed at developing and applying methods for network analysis in psychology and psychopathology (see a recent review on the topic: Borsboom & Cramer, 2013). The specific research topic will depend on the expertise and interest of the candidate, but will involve one or more of the following: Statistical methods for high dimensional data, multilevel modeling, or nonlinear dynamical models.


Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Francis Tuerlinckx (francis.tuerlinckx@ppw.kuleuven.be) and Denny Borsboom (dennyborsboom@gmail.com) for more information.

<p>Introduction: The economy isn’t going so well, but there are some interesting possibilities here at Columbia University.  One such option that you should be thinking about is the  Earth Institute Fellowship , which pays well, includes a research stipend, and puts you in an exciting interdisciplinary community of faculty and postdoctoral researchers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia brings in several postdocs each year–it’s a two-year gig–and some of them have been statisticians (recently, Kenny Shirley and Leontine Alkema).  We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health.  It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.  The EI postdoc can be a place to do interesting work and begin a research career.
 
If you’re a statistician who’s interested in this fellowship, feel free to contact me directly–you have to apply to the Earth Institute directly (see link above), but I’m happy to give you advice about</p><p>3 0.9255749 <a title="1545-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-17-%E2%80%9CStop_and_frisk%E2%80%9D_statistics.html">1942 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-17-“Stop and frisk” statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen  brings up  one of my research topics:
  
In New York City, blacks make up a quarter of the population, yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects — almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.


Those statistics represent the justification for New York City’s controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters, then it ought to be young black males whom the police stop and frisk.
  
I have two comments on this.  First,  my research with Jeff Fagan and Alex Kiss  (based on data from the late 1990s, so maybe things have changed) found that the NYPD was stopping blacks and hispanics at a rate  higher  than their previous arrest rates:
  
To briefly summarize our findings, blacks and Hispanics represented 51% and 33% of the stops while representing only 26% and 24% of the New York City population. Compared with the number of arrests of</p><p>4 0.91819966 <a title="1545-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-29-When_people_meet_this_guy%2C_can_they_resist_the_temptation_to_ask_him_what_he%E2%80%99s_doing_for_breakfast%3F%3F.html">980 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-29-When people meet this guy, can they resist the temptation to ask him what he’s doing for breakfast??</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  is hilarious ( link  from a completely deadpan Tyler Cowen).  I’d call it “unintentionally hilarious” but I’m pretty sure that rms knew this was funny when he was writing it.  It’s sort of like when you write a  top 10  list—it’s hard to resist getting silly and going over the top.  It’s only near the end that we get to the bit about the parrots.
 
All joking aside, the most interesting part of the email was this:
  
I [rms] have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every day* doing my usual work, which is responding to email about the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement.
  
I’d wondered for awhile what is it that Richard Stallman actually does, that is how does he spend his time (aside from giving lectures to promote his ideas and pay the bills).
 
 Emailing –> Blogging 
 
I too spend a lot of time on email, but a few years ago I consciously tried to shift a bunch of my email exchanges to the blog.  I found that I was sending out a lot of information to an audience of one, information</p><p>5 0.916646 <a title="1545-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.
  
They write:

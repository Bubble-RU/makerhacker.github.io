<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
Since you have commented on scientific fraud a lot. I wanted to give you an update on the  Diederik Stapel  case. I’d rather not see my name on the blog if you would elaborate on this any further.  It is long but worth the read I guess.
  
I’ll first give you the horrible details which will fill you with a mixture of horror and stupefied amazement at Stapel’s behavior.  Then I’ll share Stapel’s abject apology, which might make you feel sorry for the guy.
 
First the amazing story of how he perpetrated the fraud: 
  
  
There has been an interim report delivered to the rector of Tilburg University.


Tilburg University is cooperating with the university of Amsterdam and of Groningen in this case. The results are pretty severe, I provide here a quick and literal translation of some comments by the chairman of the investigation committee. This report is publicly available on the university webpage (along with some other things of interest) but in Dutch:

A brief update on the  Stapel scandal . It seems that the Dutch universities involved were really determined to get to the bottom of this. A first part of the outcomes of the investigations are online (in English).  Several “commissions” or “committees” (I guess no proper English but this is the way scandals are sorted out in Dutch politics too) were established to investigate the matter.


The first commission to report is the commissie Levelt:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/


The most interesting part is this I guess:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/levelt-committee/fraud-determined/ 


This concerns only the articles investigated by that commission. The others (Noort and Drenth) are expected to report in the coming months.


I [the correspondent] feel sorry for Stapel, but the amount of fraud is sizeable. I like the way the universities handle this—especially that they are fairly transparent.
  
Interesting.

 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.

After reading your recent  post , I thought you might find  this  interesting – especially the scanned interview that is included at the bottom of the posting. It’s an old OMNI interview with Walter Stewart that was the first thing I read (at a young and impressionable age ;) about the prevalence of errors, fraud and cheating in science, the institutional barriers to tackling it, the often high personal costs to whistleblowers, the difficulty of accessing scientific data to repeat published analyses, and the surprisingly negative attitude towards criticism within scientific communities. Highly recommended entertaining reading – with some good examples of scientific investigations into implausible effects. The post itself contains the info I once dug up about what happened to him later – he seems like an interesting and very determined guy: when the NIH tried to stop him from investigating scientific errors and fraud he went on a hunger strike.

<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

The most interesting part is this I guess:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/levelt-committee/fraud-determined/ 


This concerns only the articles investigated by that commission. The others (Noort and Drenth) are expected to report in the coming months.


I [the correspondent] feel sorry for Stapel, but the amount of fraud is sizeable. I like the way the universities handle this—especially that they are fairly transparent.
  
Interesting. This all seems like overkill given how obvio</p><p>5 0.80799621 <a title="1599-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Why_no_Wegmania%3F.html">722 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Why no Wegmania?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague asks:
  
When I search the web, I find  the story  [of the article by Said, Wegman, et al. on social networks in climate research, which was recently bumped from the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis because of plagiarism] only on blogs, USA Today, and UPI.  Why is that?  Any idea why it isn’t reported by any of the major newspapers?
  
Here’s my answer:
 
1.  USA Today broke the story.  Apparently this USA Today reporter put a lot of effort into it.  The NYT doesn’t like to run a story that begins, “Yesterday, USA Today reported…”
 
2.  To us it’s big news because we’re statisticians.  [The main guy in the study, Edward Wegman, won the Founders Award from the American Statistical Association a few years ago.]  To the rest of the world, the story is:  “Obscure prof at an obscure college plagiarized an article in a journal that nobody’s ever heard of.”  When a Harvard scientist paints black dots on white mice and says he’s curing cancer, that’s news.

<p>Introduction: Lyric Semiconductor   posted:
  

For over 60 years, computers have been based on digital computing principles. Data is represented as bits (0s and 1s). Boolean logic gates perform operations on these bits. A processor steps through many of these operations serially in order to perform a function. However, today’s most interesting problems are not at all suited to this approach.


Here at Lyric Semiconductor, we are redesigning information processing circuits from the ground up to natively process probabilities: from the gate circuits to the processor architecture to the programming language.  As a result, many applications that today require a thousand conventional processors will soon run in just one Lyric processor, providing 1,000x efficiencies in cost, power, and size.

  
 Om Malik  has some more information, also relating to the team and the business.
 
The fundamental idea is that computing architectures work deterministically, even though the world is fundamentally stochastic.</p><p>3 0.91347325 <a title="1599-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-14-Preferential_admissions_for_children_of_elite_colleges.html">853 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-14-Preferential admissions for children of elite colleges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jenny Anderson  reports  on a discussion of the practice of colleges preferential admission of children of alumni:
  
 
[Richard] Kahlenberg citing research from his book “Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions” made the case that getting into good schools matters — 12 institutions making up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population produced 42 percent of government leaders and 54 percent of corporate leaders.


And being a legacy helps improve an applicant’s chances of getting in, with one study finding that being a primary legacy — the son or daughter of an undergraduate alumnus or alumna — increases one’s chance of admission by 45.1 percent.
 

 
I’d call that 45 percent but I get the basic idea.
 
But then Jeffrey Brenzel of the Yale admissions office replied:
  
“We turn away 80 percent of our legacies, and we feel it every day,” Mr. Brenzel said, adding that he rejected more offspring of the school’s Sterling donors than he accepted this year (</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90793741 <a title="1599-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-%E2%80%9CThe_scientific_literature_must_be_cleansed_of_everything_that_is_fraudulent%2C_especially_if_it_involves_the_work_of_a_leading_academic%E2%80%9D.html">1599 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-“The scientific literature must be cleansed of everything that is fraudulent, especially if it involves the work of a leading academic”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone points me to  this report  from Tilburg University on disgraced psychology researcher Diederik Stapel.  The reports includes bits like this:
  
When the fraud was first discovered, limiting the harm it caused for the victims was a matter of urgency. This was particularly the case for Mr Stapel’s former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers . . . However, the Committees were of the opinion that the main bulk of the work had not yet even started. . . . Journal publications can often leave traces that reach far into and even beyond scientific disciplines. The self-cleansing character of science calls for fraudulent publications to be withdrawn and no longer to proliferate within the literature. In addition, based on their initial impressions, the Committees believed that there were other serious issues within Mr Stapel’s publications . . . This brought into the spotlight a research culture in which this sloppy science, alongside out-and-out fraud, was able to remain undetected</p><p>5 0.90757608 <a title="1599-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-09-iPython_Notebook.html">1716 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-09-iPython Notebook</a></p>

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.

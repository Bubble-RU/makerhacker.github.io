From  yesterday :

Solution:  estimate is p.hat=10/40=0.25.  Se is sqrt(1-f)*sqrt(p.hat*(1-.hat)/n)=sqrt(1-0.4)*sqrt(0.25*0.75/40)=0.053.  95% interval is [0.25 +/- 2*0.053] = [0.14,0.36].</p><p>5 0.14117435 <a title="1337-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-25-Basketball_Stats%3A__Don%E2%80%99t_model_the_probability_of_win%2C_model_the_expected_score_differential..html">2224 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-25-Basketball Stats:  Donât model the probability of win, model the expected score differential.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone who wants to remain anonymous writes:
  
I am working to create a more accurate in-game win probability model for basketball games. My idea is for each timestep in a game (a second, 5 seconds, etc), use the Vegas line, the current score differential, who has the ball, and the number of possessions played already (to account for differences in pace) to create a point estimate probability of the home team winning.


This problem would seem to fit a multi-level model structure well. It seems silly to estimate 2,000 regressions (one for each timestep), but the coefficients should vary at each timestep. Do you have suggestions for what type of model this could/would be? Additionally, I believe this needs to be some form of logit/probit given the binary dependent variable (win or loss).


Finally, do you have suggestions for what package could accomplish this in Stata or R?
  
To answer the questions in reverse order: 
3.  Iâd hope this could be done in Stan (which can be run from R)</p><p>6 0.14053042 <a title="1337-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-Question_26_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1367 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-Question 26 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 14. A public health survey of elderly Americans includes many questions, including âHow many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?â and also several questions about current mobility and health status. Response rates are high for the questions about recent activities and status, but there is a lot of nonresponse for the question on past activity. You are considering imputing the missing values on the question, âHow many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?â Which of the following statements are basically correct? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If done reasonably well, imputation is preferred to available-case and complete-case analysis.

<p>Introduction: 12. A researcher fits a regression model predicting some political behavior given predictors for demographics and several measures of economic ideology. The coefficients for the ideology measures are not statistically significant, and the researcher creates a new measure, adding up the ideology questions and creating a common score, and then fits a new regression including the new score and removing the individual ideology questions from the model. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If the original ideology measures are close to 100% correlated with each other, there will be essentially no benefit from this approach.
 
(b) If the original ideology measures are not on a common scale, they should be rescaled before adding them up.
 
(c) If the original result was not statistically significant, the researcher should stop, so as to avoid data dredging and selection bias.

I am having trouble thinking Bayesianly about the so-called ânormalâ or âreferenceâ values that I am supposed to use in some of the tests I perform. These values are obtained from purportedly healthy people. Setting aside concerns about ascertainment bias, non-parametric distributions, and the like, the values are usually obtained by setting the limits at Â± 2SD from the mean. In some cases, supposedly because of a non-normal distribution, the third highest and lowest value observed in the healthy group sets the limits, on the assumption that no more than 2 results (out of 20 samples) are allowed to exceed these values: if there are 3 or more, then the test is assumed to be abnormal and the reference range is said to reflect the 90th percentile. The results are binary â normal, abnormal.


The relevance to the diseased state is this. People who are known unequivocally to have condition X show Y abnormalities in these tests.

 Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. 
  
I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstoneâs excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on âThe G.O.P.âs Dukakis Problemâ?
 
Iâll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that Iâm happy with Chaitâs quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where Iâm coming from but my take-home point is that weâre mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: Lasso and me 
 
For a long time I was wrong about lasso.
 
Lasso (âleast absolute shrinkage and selection operatorâ) is a regularization procedure that shrinks regression coefficients toward zero, and in its basic form is equivalent to maximum penalized likelihood estimation with a penalty function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients.
 
I first heard about lasso from a talk that  Trevor Hastie  Rob Tibshirani gave at Berkeley in 1994 or 1995.  He demonstrated that it shrunk regression coefficients to zero.  I wasnât impressed, first because it seemed like no big deal (if thatâs the prior you use, thatâs the shrinkage you get) and second because, from a Bayesian perspective, I donât  want  to shrink things all the way to zero.  In the sorts of social and environmental science problems Iâve worked on, just about nothing is zero.  Iâd like to control my noisy estimates but thereâs nothing special about zero.  At the end of the talk I stood</p><p>5 0.96388894 <a title="1337-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-09-There%E2%80%99s_no_evidence_that_voters_choose_presidential_candidates_based_on_their_looks.html">654 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-09-Thereâs no evidence that voters choose presidential candidates based on their looks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Chait  writes  that the most important aspect of a presidential candidate is âpolitical talentâ:
  
Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America. Favorite character types include jocks, movie stars, folksy Texans and war heroes. . . . [But the frontrunners for the 2012 Republican nomination] make Michael Dukakis look like John F. Kennedy. They are qualified enough to serve as president, but wildly unqualified to run for president. . . . [Mitch] Danielsâs drawbacks begin â but by no means end â with his lack of height, hair and charisma. . . . [Jeb Bush] suffers from an inherent branding challenge [because of his last name]. . . .

<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.

<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>5 0.1731177 <a title="1180-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-03-Is_Harvard_hurting_poor_kids_by_cutting_tuition_for_the_upper_middle_class%3F.html">598 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-03-Is Harvard hurting poor kids by cutting tuition for the upper middle class?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Timothy Noah  reports :
  
At the end of 2007, Harvard announced that it would limit tuition to no more than 10 percent of family income for families earning up to $180,000. (It also eliminated all loans, following a trail blazed by Princeton, and stopped including home equity in its calculations of family wealth.) Yale saw and raised to $200,000, and other wealthy colleges weighed in with variations.
  
Noah argues that this is a bad thing because it encourages other colleges to give tuition breaks to families with six-figure incomes, thus sucking up money that could otherwise go to reduce tuition for lower-income students.  For example:
  
Roger Lehecka, a former dean of students at Columbia, and Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies there, wrote in the New York Times that Harvard’s initiative was “good news for students at Harvard or Yale” but “bad news” for everyone else. “The problem,” they explained, “is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale’s</p><p>6 0.17236653 <a title="1180-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.

<p>Introduction: Steven Levitt  writes :.
  
 
Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.
 
P.S.  Levitt also writes:
  
The one thing that puzzles me [Levitt] is why in the world would he want to be on the Board of the Federal Reserve? One thing economists just don’t understand are people’s preferences.
  
To get meta here for a moment . . . just as Levitt can’t understand Diamond’s preferences, I find it extremely difficult to understand that Levitt is puzzled by Diamond’s desire to serve on the Federal Reserve,
 
It’s obvious, no?

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>3 0.98674172 <a title="1180-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Where_are_the_larger-than-life_athletes%3F.html">1115 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Where are the larger-than-life athletes?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.  I supp</p><p>4 0.98572785 <a title="1180-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-Elevator_shame_is_a_two-way_street.html">528 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-Elevator shame is a two-way street</a></p>

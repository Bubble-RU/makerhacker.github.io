<p>Introduction: I saw  this excellent art show  the other day, and it reminded me how much artistic talent is out there.  I really have no idea whassup with those all-black canvases and the other stuff you see at modern art museums, given that there’s so much interesting new stuff being created every year.  I see a big difference between art made by people who feel they have something they want to say, compared to art being made by people who feel they are supposed to make art because they’re artists.  And there’s also the internal logic of art responding to other art, as Tom Wolfe discussed in The Painted Word.</p><p>3 0.094784781 <a title="1281-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-25-The_von_Neumann_paradox.html">430 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-25-The von Neumann paradox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I, like  Steve Hsu , I too would love to read a definitive biography of John von Neumann (or, as we’d say in the U.S., “John Neumann”).  I’ve read little things about him in various places such as Stanislaw Ulam’s classic autobiography, and two things I’ve repeatedly noticed are:
 
1.  Neumann comes off as a obnoxious, self-satisfied jerk.  He just seems like the kind of guy I wouldn’t like in real life.
 
2.  All these great men seem to really have loved the guy.
 
It’s hard for me to reconcile  two impressions above.  Of course, lots of people have a good side and a bad side, but what’s striking here is that my impressions of Neumann’s bad side come from the very stories that his friends use to demonstrate how lovable he was!  So, yes, I’d like to see the biography–but only if it could resolve this paradox.
 
Also, I don’t know how relevant this is, but Neumann shares one thing with the more-lovable Ulam and the less-lovable Mandelbrot:  all had Jewish backgrounds but didn’t seem to</p><p>4 0.084657699 <a title="1281-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_think_we_get_much_out_of_framing_politics_as_the_Tragic_Vision_vs._the_Utopian_Vision.html">1892 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-10-I don’t think we get much out of framing politics as the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg writes:
  
Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>5 0.084625378 <a title="1281-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist_claims_that_modern_art_could_just_as_well_be_replaced_by_a_%E2%80%9Cpaint-throwing_chimp%E2%80%9D.html">1390 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist claims that modern art could just as well be replaced by a “paint-throwing chimp”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>3 0.82215446 <a title="1281-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell_and_Chabris%2C_David_and_Goliath%2C_and_science_writing_as_stone_soup.html">2058 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell and Chabris, David and Goliath, and science writing as stone soup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The only thing is, I’m not sure who’s David here and who is Goliath.  From the standpoint of book sales, Gladwell is Goliath for sure.  On the other hand, Gladwell’s credibility has been weakened over the years by fights with bigshots such as Steven Pinker.  Maybe the best analogy is a boxing match where Gladwell stands in the ring and fighter after fighter is sent in to bang him up.  At some point the heavyweight gets a little bit tired. (Recently Gladwell had a New Yorker column defending dopers such as Lance Armstrong, so I suspect he’ll have Kaiser Fung  coming  after him  again , once the current lucha with Chabris is over.)
 
Chabris took his swing at Gladwell a few days ago, as I reported  here .
 
Yesterday was Gladwell’s  turn .  I have a lot of sympathy for the Blink-man here:  he writes these bestsellers and puts himself out there, so he’s a target.  If Gladwell’s books were generic business-bestseller pap of the be-yourself-and-be-tough variety, he wouldn’t get hassled.

<p>Introduction: This  amusing-yet-so-true video directed by Eléonore Pourriat shows a sex-role-reversed world where women are in charge and men don’t get taken seriously.  It’s convincing and affecting, but the twist that interests me comes at the end, when the real world returns.  It’s really creepy.
 
And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat’s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don’t think would’ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.
 
The point here is that the real world is indeed what is real.  This alternative sex-role-reversed world is not actually possible, and what makes it interesting to think about is the contrast to what really is.

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>6 0.8131178 <a title="1281-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-06-Ideas_that_spread_fast_and_slow.html">2053 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-06-Ideas that spread fast and slow</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amy Hundley writes in the New Yorker about a notorious recent case of unacknowledged literary  quilting :
  
I [Hundley] was the editor at Grove/Atlantic to whom Quentin Rowan’s novel “Appearance and the Park” was submitted (“The Plagiarist’s Tale,” by Lizzie Widdicombe, February 13th & 20th). Widdicombe writes that the editor in question thought that “its plot was too close to that of another of the house’s books, ‘My Idea of Fun,’ by Will Self,” and I can only assume that this explanation came from Rowan. In fact, Rowan had lifted a passage nearly verbatim from Will Self’s novella “The Sweet Smell of Psychosis.” It was an especially delicious one, in which Self describes the media denizens of a particular bar. I recognized it immediately and informed his agent that he’d plagiarized it. Writing a plot similar to a successful novelist’s—something that can arise innocently—is very different from plagiarizing. Appropriating and remixing someone else’s work while acknowledging sources is</p><p>2 0.84525025 <a title="1281-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>3 0.84521163 <a title="1281-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Stand_Your_Ground_laws_and_homicides.html">1397 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Stand Your Ground laws and homicides</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  reports  on the sympathy that well-known physicist Freeman Dyson has with crackpot theorists.  The interesting part is that Dyson has positive feelings for these cranks,  even while believing that their theories are completely wrong :
  
In my [Dyson's] career as a scientist, I twice had the good fortune to be a personal friend of a famous dissident. One dissident, Sir Arthur Eddington, was an insider like Thomson and Tait. The other, Immanuel Velikovsky, was an outsider like Carter. Both of them were tragic figures, intellectually brilliant and morally courageous, with the same fatal flaw as Carter. Both of them were possessed by fantasies that people with ordinary common sense could recognize as nonsense. I made it clear to both that I did not believe their fantasies, but I admired them as human beings and as imaginative artists. I admired them most of all for their stubborn refusal to remain silent. With the whole world against them, they remained true to their beliefs.</p><p>6 0.82137132 <a title="1281-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-19-%E2%80%9CPoor_Smokers_in_New_York_State_Spend_25%25_of_Income_on_Cigarettes%2C_Study_Finds%E2%80%9D.html">1503 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-19-“Poor Smokers in New York State Spend 25% of Income on Cigarettes, Study Finds”</a></p>

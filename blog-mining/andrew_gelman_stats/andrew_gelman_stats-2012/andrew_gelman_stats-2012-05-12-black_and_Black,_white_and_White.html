<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.  But what’s amazing i</p><p>3 0.18190916 <a title="1316-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-The_moral_of_the_story_is%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_look_yourself_up_on_Google.html">125 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-The moral of the story is, Don’t look yourself up on Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The fun part of this entry comes near the end.
 
Amanda Marcotte has some  nice things to say  about Red State, Blue State and connects our findings with some current political conflicts.  She picks up on our theme of perception and reality, that national journalists live in a different world and can have difficulty grasping national voting patterns:
  
 
The book definitively answers the perplexing question of our time, which is, “Why do poor people in red states vote against their economic interests?” The answer is, quite simply, they don’t.  There is no paradox.  To quote Gelman: “If poor people were a state, they would be ‘bluer’ even than Massachusetts; if rich people were a state, they would be as ‘red’ as Alabama, Kansas, the Dakotas, or Texas.”


Of course, I don’t think the stereotype of tea baggers have ever been that they’re poor.  But I do think there’s a supposition that they’re lower or middle middle class, and not well-educated.  That’s based on the illiterate signage, t</p><p>4 0.12720171 <a title="1316-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.12245262 <a title="1316-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-20-Not_quite_getting_the_point.html">1073 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-20-Not quite getting the point</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I gave  this talk  the other day and afterwards, a white guy came up to me and said he thought it was no coincidence that the researcher who made the mistake was “Oriental.”  He then went on for about 5 minutes explaining his theory.

<p>Introduction: I was sent a copy of “Numbers Rule:  The Vexing Mathematics of Democracy, from Plato to the Present,” by George Szpiro.  It’s an interesting book that I think a lot of people will like, going over a bunch of voting paradoxes in the context of historical stories.  Some of the topics (Arrow’s theorem and its recent refinements) are more interesting than others (the always nauseatingly boring (to me) of the “Alabama paradox” and various rules about which states get one extra House seat; for some reason people are always writing about this topic about which I could care less).  But you can pick and choose among the chapters, so unevenness isn’t really such a problem.
 
One thing that fascinates me about the topic of mathematics and representation is how many different ways there are to look at it.
  

 
In 2002, I published a paper in Chance called Voting, Fairness, and Political Representation ( here’s a preprint version ; it later appeared, slightly revised, as a chapter in our  Quantita</p><p>3 0.71555436 <a title="1316-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-06-Statistical_models_and_actual_models.html">995 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-06-Statistical models and actual models</a></p>

My friend: “Actually, I do modeling too…”

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>6 0.68900502 <a title="1316-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-27-White_stripes_and_dead_armadillos.html">2308 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-27-White stripes and dead armadillos</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff writes:
  
How far off is bglmer and can it handle ordered logit or multinom logit?
  
My reply:
 
bglmer is very close.  No ordered logit but I was just talking about it with Sophia today.  My guess is that the easiest way to fit a hierarchical ordered logit or multinom logit will be to use stan.  For right now I’d recommend using glmer/bglmer to fit the ordered logits in order (e.g., 1 vs. 2,3,4, then 2 vs. 3,4, then 3 vs. 4).  Or maybe there’s already a hierarchical multinomial logit in mcmcpack or somewhere?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91006315 <a title="1316-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-12-black_and_Black%2C_white_and_White.html">1316 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-12-black and Black, white and White</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve always thought it looked strange to see people referred to in print as Black or White rather than black or white.  For example consider this sentence:  “A black guy was walking down the street and he saw a bunch of white guys standing around.”  That looks fine, whereas “A Black guy was walking down the street and he saw a bunch of White guys standing around”—that looks weird to me, as if the encounter was taking place in an Ethnic Studies seminar.
 
But maybe I’m wrong on this.  Jay Livingston  argues  that black and white are colors whereas Black and White are races (or, as I would prefer to say, ethnic categories) and illustrates with this picture of a white person and a White person:
 
   
 
In conversation, I sometimes talk about pink people, brown people, and tan people, but that won’t work in a research paper.
 
P.S.  I suspect Carp will argue that I’m being naive:  meanings of words change across contexts and over time.

<p>Introduction: Tables are commonly read as crude graphs: what you notice in a table of numbers is (a) the minus signs, and thus which values are positive and which are negative, and (b) the length of each number, that is, its order of magnitude. The most famous example of such a read might be when the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan supposedly conjectured the asymptotic form of the partition function based on a look at a table of the first several partition numbers: he was essentially looking at a graph on the logarithmic scale.

I had a lot of fun creating the “calculator font” for the above graph in R and then writing the article. I hope you enjoy it too!

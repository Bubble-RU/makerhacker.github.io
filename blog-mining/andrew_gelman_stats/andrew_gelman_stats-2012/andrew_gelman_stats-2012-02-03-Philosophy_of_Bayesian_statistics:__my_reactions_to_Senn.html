<p>Introduction: I recently saw  this article  that Stephen Senn wrote a couple of years ago, criticizing Bayesian sensitivity analyses that relied on vague prior distributions.  I’m moving more and more toward the idea that Bayesian analysis should include actual prior information, so I generally agree with his points.  As I used to say when teaching Bayesian data analysis, a Bayesian model is modular, and different pieces can be swapped in and out as needed.  So you might start with an extremely weak prior distribution, but if it makes a difference it’s time to bite the bullet and include more information.
 
My only disagreement with Senn’s paper is in its recommendation to try the so-called fixed-effects analysis.  Beyond the difficulties with terminology (the expressions “fixed” and “random” effects are defined in different ways by different people in the literature;  see here  for a rant on the topic which made its way into some of my articles and books), there is the problem that, when a model ge</p><p>3 0.30003792 <a title="1151-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-05-What_is_a_prior_distribution%3F.html">1155 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-05-What is a prior distribution?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some recent blog discussion revealed some confusion that I’ll try to resolve here.
 
I  wrote  that I’m not a big fan of subjective priors.  Various commenters had difficulty with this point, and I think the issue was most clearly stated by Bill Jeff re erys, who  wrote :
  
It seems to me that your prior has to reflect your subjective information before you look at the data. How can it not?


But this does not mean that the (subjective) prior that you choose is irrefutable; Surely a prior that reflects prior information just does not have to be inconsistent with that information. But that still leaves a range of priors that are consistent with it, the sort of priors that one would use in a sensitivity analysis, for example.
  
I think I see what Bill is getting at.  A prior represents your subjective belief, or some approximation to your subjective belief, even if it’s not perfect.  That sounds reasonable but I don’t think it works.  Or, at least, it often doesn’t work.

<p>Introduction: I’ll answer the above question after first sharing some background and history on the the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, which appeared at the end of our  rejoinder  to the discussion to which I  linked  the other day:
  
When we were beginning our statistical educations, the word ‘Bayesian’ conveyed membership in an obscure cult. Statisticians who were outside the charmed circle could ignore the Bayesian subfield, while Bayesians themselves tended to be either apologetic or brazenly defiant. These two extremes manifested themselves in ever more elaborate proposals for non-informative priors, on the one hand, and declarations of the purity of subjective probability, on the other.


Much has changed in the past 30 years. ‘Bayesian’ is now often used in casual scientific parlance as a synonym for ‘rational’, the anti-Bayesians have mostly disappeared, and non-Bayesian statisticians feel the need to keep up with developments in Bayesian modelling and computation. Bayesians themselves</p><p>5 0.28237343 <a title="1151-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Charlie Williams writes:
  
As I get interested in Bayesian approaches to statistics, I have one question I wondered if you would find interesting to address at some point on the blog.


What does Bayesian work look like in action across a field? From experience, I have some feeling for how ongoing debates evolve (or not) with subsequent studies in response to earlier findings. I wonder if you know how this happens in practice when multiple researchers are using Bayesian approaches. How much are previous findings built into priors? How much advance comes from model improvement? And in a social science field where self-selection and self-interest play a role, how are improved “treatment” effects incorporated and evaluated?


I thought you might know of a field where actual back and forth has been carried out mostly in the context of Bayesian analysis or inference, and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at an example as I think about my own field.

<p>Introduction: Continuing with my discussion  here  and  here  of the articles in the special issue of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
David Hendry, “Empirical Economic Model Discovery and Theory Evaluation”:
 
Hendry presents a wide-ranging overview of scientific learning, with an interesting comparison of physical with social sciences.  (For some reason, he discusses many physical sciences but restricts his social-science examples to economics and psychology.)
 
The only part of Hendry’s long and interesting article that I will discuss, however, is the part where he decides to take a gratuitous swing at Bayes.  I don’t know why he did this, but maybe it’s part of some fraternity initiation thing, like TP-ing the dean’s house on Halloween.
 
Here’s the story.  Hendry writes:

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo recommended that I consider coming up with a new name for the statistical methods that I used, given that the term “Bayesian” has all sorts of associations that I dislike (as discussed, for example, in section 1 of  this article ).
 
I replied that I agree on Bayesian, I never liked the term and always wanted something better, but I couldn’t think of any convenient alternative.  Also, I was finding that Bayesians (even the Bayesians I disagreed with) were reading my research articles, while non-Bayesians were simply ignoring them.  So I thought it was best to identify with, and communicate with, those people who were willing to engage with me.
 
More formally, I’m happy defining “Bayesian” as “using inference from the posterior distribution, p(theta|y)”.  This says nothing about where the probability distributions come from (thus, no requirement to be “subjective” or “objective”) and it says nothing about the models (thus, no requirement to use the discrete models that hav</p><p>6 0.81956714 <a title="1151-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics_%28with_all_the_discussions%21%29.html">1712 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (with all the discussions!)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Stephen Senn, “You May Believe You Are a Bayesian But You Are Probably Wrong”:
 
I agree with Senn’s comments on the impossibility of the de Finetti subjective Bayesian approach.  As I wrote in 2008, if you could really construct a subjective prior you believe in, why not just look at the data and write down your subjective posterior.  The immense practical difficulties with  any  serious system of inference render it absurd to think that it would be possible to just write down a probability distribution to represent uncertainty.  I wish, however, that Senn would recognize  my  Bayesian approach (which is also that of John Carlin, Hal Stern, Don Rubin, and, I believe, others).  De Finetti is no longer around, but we are!
 
I have to admit that my own Bayesian views and practices have changed.  In particular, I resonate wit</p><p>2 0.95618939 <a title="1151-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-03-Google_Translate_for_code%2C_and_an_R_help-list_bot.html">1296 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-03-Google Translate for code, and an R help-list bot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What we did in our Stan meeting yesterday:
 
Some discussion of revision of the Nuts paper, some conversations about parameterizations of categorical-data models, plans for the R interface, blah blah blah.
 
But also, I had two exciting new ideas!
 
 Google Translate for code 
 
Wouldn’t it be great if Google Translate could work on computer languages?  I suggested this and somebody said that it might be a problem because code isn’t always translatable.  But that doesn’t worry so much.  Google Translate for human languages isn’t perfect either but it’s a useful guide.  If I want to write a message to someone in French or Spanish or Dutch, I wouldn’t just write it in English and run it through Translate.  What I do is try my best to write it in the desired language, but I can try out some tricky words or phrases in the translator.  Or, if I start by translating, I go back and forth to make sure it all makes sense.

<p>Introduction: I had an email exchange with Patrick Steigler the other day that amused me, so I’ll share it with you.
 
Steigler started with the subject line “Taleb and STDEV vs. MAD” and the message:  I came across http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25401 and was wondering what your thoughts on the issue might be. 
 
My reply:  How come they never ask me for my opinions in these surveys?
 
Steigler:  Maybe you need to write a book of aphorisms.
 
me:  There’s this:

and then this, which some students collected from a course I taught:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/gelman_quotes.pdf
 
Steigler:  So, what would you opinion be on the scientific idea that is ready for retirement?
 
me:  I guess it’s a good thing they didn’t ask me!
 
Steigler:  How about the retirement of p value < .05 for significance?
 
me:  Yeah, but that’s too easy.  It’s like if someone asks for a pop music recommendation and you say The Beatles.

<p>Introduction: At Picnic Cafe, Broadway at 101 St, 6-7pm today.
  
Should we vote even though it probably won’t make a difference? Why is the question “Are we better off now than four years ago?” not an appeal to selfishness? Are Americans as polarized as we think? Come explore these and other questions about voting in America today.
  
It’s the usual stuff but close-up so lots of opportunity to argue and heckle.  No slides or graphs.  My plan is to hand out 30-50 index cards, each with a phrase (for example, “Moderation in the pursuit of moderation is no vice” or “Gerrymandering is good for you” or “How to predict elections”), then participants can call out topics and I’ll yap on them (with discussion) till we run out of time.
 
It’ll be weird to talk without graphs.  We’ll see how it goes.</p><p>5 0.9320206 <a title="1151-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-11-Gelman_on_Hennig_on_Gelman_on_Bayes.html">1208 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-11-Gelman on Hennig on Gelman on Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo pointed me to  this discussion  by Christian Hennig of my recent  article  on Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
A couple days ago I  responded  to comments by Mayo, Stephen Senn, and Larry Wasserman.  I will respond to Hennig by pulling out paragraphs from his discussion and then replying.
 
Hennig:
  
for me the terms “frequentist” and “subjective Bayes” point to interpretations of probability, and not to specific methods of inference. The frequentist one refers to the idea that there is an underlying data generating process that repeatedly throws out data and would approximate the assumed distribution if one could only repeat it infinitely often.
  
Hennig makes the good point that, if this is the way you would define “frequentist” (it’s not how I’d define the term myself, but I’ll use Hennig’s definition here), then it makes sense to be a frequentist in some settings but not others.

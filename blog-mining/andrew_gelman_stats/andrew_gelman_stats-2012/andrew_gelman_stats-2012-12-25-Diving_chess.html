<p>Introduction: In honor of the  Olympics , I got my butt over to the park and played run-around-the-house chess for the first time ever.
 
As was discussed in the comments thread  awhile ago , there seem to be three possible ways to play Turing chess:
 
1.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return.  Once you sit down to the table, the other player runs around the house.  Then you have to move, etc.  You lose if you are checkmated or if you fail to move before your opponent returns to his chair.
 
2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.
 
3.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs.  When you return, yo</p><p>3 0.40080523 <a title="1638-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-16-Chess_vs._checkers.html">615 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-16-Chess vs. checkers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces.

Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?

I see you have a blog post about turing chess . . . I’ve seen another reference to it but am unable to find a definitive source. Do you know of a source where I could find out about the history of the idea?
  
My reply:
 
You mean the run-around-the-house thing?  I don’t know where it comes from.  It’s a well known story, if you google Turing chess run around the house you can find lots of references but I don’t know the definitive source.  I can blog and see if anything comes up!
 
I’ve never actually played the game.  I’ll try it outdoors sometime, perhaps.  When I last  posted  on the topic, we had a fun discussion, revealing that the rules are not as clear as one might think.  It makes me wonder if anyone’s thought hard about it and come up with a good set of “official rules.”

<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>6 0.76427406 <a title="1638-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-08-Of_parsing_and_chess.html">1847 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-08-Of parsing and chess</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Knowing of my interest in  Turing run-around-the-house chess , David Lockhart points me to  this :
  
Diving Chess is a chess variant, which is played in a swimming pool. Instead of using chess clocks, each player must submerge themselves underwater during their turn, only to resurface when they are ready to make a move. Players must make a move within 5 seconds of resurfacing (they will receive a warning if not, and three warnings will result in a forfeit). Diving Chess was invented by American Chess Master Etan Ilfeld; the very first exhibition game took place between Ilfeld and former British Chess Champion William Hartston at the Thirdspace gym in Soho on August 2nd, 2011. Hartston won the match which lasted almost two hours such that each player was underwater for an entire hour.</p><p>2 0.79792964 <a title="1638-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-I_got_one_of_these_letters_once_and_was_so_irritated_that_I_wrote_back_to_the_journal_withdrawing_my_paper.html">1069 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-I got one of these letters once and was so irritated that I wrote back to the journal withdrawing my paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Marc Tanguay writes in with a specific question that has a very general answer.  First, the question:
  
I [Tanguay] am currently running a MCMC for which I have 3 parameters that are restricted to a specific space. 2 are bounded between 0 and 1 while the third is binary and updated by a Beta-Binomial. Since my priors are also bounded, I notice that, conditional on All the rest (which covers both data and other parameters), the density was not varying a lot within the space of the parameters. As a result, the acceptance rate is high, about 85%, and this despite the fact that all the parameter’s space is explore. Since in your book, the optimal acceptance rates prescribed are lower that 50% (in case of multiple parameters), do you think I should worry about getting 85%.  Or is this normal given the restrictions on the parameters?
  
First off:  Yes, my guess is that you should be taking bigger jumps.  85% seems like too high an acceptance rate for Metropolis jumping.

<p>Introduction: We just released Stan 1.1.1 and RStan 1.1.1
 
As usual, you can find download and install instructions at:
 
http://mc-stan.org/
 
This is a patch release and is fully backward compatible with Stan and RStan 1.1.0.  The main thing you should notice is that the multivariate models should be much faster and all the bugs reported for 1.1.0 have been fixed.  We’ve also added a bit more functionality.  The substantial changes are listed in the following release notes. 
   
v1.1.1 (5 February 2012) 
======================================================================
 
Bug Fixes 
———————————- 
* fixed bug in comparison operators, which swapped operator< with operator<= and swapped operator> with operator>= semantics 
* auto-initialize all variables to prevent segfaults 
* atan2 gradient propagation fixed 
* fixed off-by-one in NUTS treedepth bound so NUTS goes at most to specified tree depth rather than specified depth + 1 
* various compiler compatibility and minor consistency issues 
* f</p><p>5 0.71838427 <a title="1638-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Busted%21.html">221 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Busted!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m just glad that universities don’t  sanction  professors for publishing false theorems.
 
If the guy really is nailed by the feds for fraud, I hope they don’t throw him in prison.  In general, prison time seems like a brutal, expensive, and inefficient way to punish people.  I’d prefer if the government just took 95% of his salary for several years, made him do community service (cleaning equipment at the local sewage treatment plant, perhaps; a lab scientist should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc.  If restriction of this dude’s personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, he could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if he were ever more than 3 miles from his home.  But no need to bill the taxpayers for the cost of keeping him in prison.</p><p>6 0.6864627 <a title="1638-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar_update%3A__Additional_research_on_estimating_small_fractions_of_the_population.html">150 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar update:  Additional research on estimating small fractions of the population</a></p>

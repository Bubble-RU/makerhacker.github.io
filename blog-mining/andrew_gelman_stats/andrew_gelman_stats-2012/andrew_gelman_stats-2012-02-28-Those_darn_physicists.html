<p>Introduction: I have an optimization problem:  I have a complicated physical model that predicts energy and thermal behavior of a building, given the values of a slew of parameters, such as insulation effectiveness, window transmissivity, etc.  I’m trying to find the parameter set that best fits several weeks of thermal and energy use data from the real building that we modeled. (Of course I would rather explore parameter space and come up with probability distributions for the parameters, and maybe that will come later, but for now I’m just optimizing).  To do the optimization, colleagues and I implemented a “particle swarm optimization” algorithm on a massively parallel machine. This involves giving each of about 120 “particles” an initial position in parameter space, then letting them move around, trying to move to better positions according to a specific algorithm.  We gave each particle an initial position sampled from our prior distribution for each parameter.  So far we’ve run about 140 itera</p><p>3 0.15091395 <a title="1189-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-13-A_personal_bit_of_spam%2C_just_for_me%21.html">1211 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-13-A personal bit of spam, just for me!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Andrew,


I came across your site while searching for blogs and posts around American obesity and wanted to reach out to get your readership’s feedback on an infographic my team built which focuses on the obesity of America and where we could end up at the going rate.


If you’re interested, let’s connect. Have a great weekend!


Thanks.

<p>Introduction: Jeffrey Frankel, identified as a former member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers,  writes  (link from  here ):
  
As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. . . .


The unspoken truth is that, compared to “blue-staters,” those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies.
  
An unspoken truth, huh?  Wow, that really sucks!  Something should be done about it.  Good thing that this Harvard professor and former member of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors is on the case:

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis, a medical scientist perhaps best known for his  controversial  claim (see also  here ), based on joint work with James Fowler, that obesity is contagious,  writes : 
  
  
The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .


I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomen</p><p>6 0.076062784 <a title="1189-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Still_more_Mr._P_in_public_health.html">770 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Still more Mr. P in public health</a></p>

<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:
  
Participants in the Health Prize challenge will be given a data set comprised of the de-identified medical records of 100,000 individuals who are members of HPN.  The teams will then need to predict the hospitalization of a set percentage of those members who went to the hospital during the year following the start date, and do so with a defined accuracy rate.  The winners will receive the $3 million prize. . . . the contest is designed to spur involvement by others involved in analytics, such as those involved in data mining and predictive modeling who may not currently be working in health care.  “We believe that doing so will bring innovative thinking to health analytics and may allow us to solve at</p><p>3 0.67089766 <a title="1189-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-29-Data_mining_and_allergies.html">685 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-29-Data mining and allergies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all this data floating around, there are some interesting analyses one can do. I came across  “The Association of Tree Pollen Concentration Peaks and Allergy Medication Sales in New York City: 2003-2008″  by  Perry Sheffield . There they correlate pollen counts with anti-allergy medicine sales – and indeed find that two days after high pollen counts, the medicine sales are the highest.
 
 
 
Of course, it would be interesting to play with the data to see *what* tree is actually causing the sales to increase the most. Perhaps this would help the arborists what trees to plant. At the moment they seem to be following  a rather sexist approach  to tree planting:
  

Ogren says the city could solve the problem by planting only female trees, which don’t produce pollen like male trees do.


City arborists shy away from females because many produce messy – or in the case of ginkgos, smelly – fruit that litters sidewalks.


In Ogren’s opinion, that’s a mistake. He says the females only pro</p><p>4 0.66688228 <a title="1189-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Stand_Your_Ground_laws_and_homicides.html">1397 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Stand Your Ground laws and homicides</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>6 0.64401722 <a title="1189-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-07-Analysis_of_Power_Law_of_Participation.html">946 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-07-Analysis of Power Law of Participation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.
 
Here’s a quick graph; there’s more in the article:</p><p>3 0.92441547 <a title="1189-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-28-Brow_inflation.html">489 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-28-Brow inflation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>4 0.90193474 <a title="1189-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Boris_was_right.html">44 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Boris was right</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>6 0.88933694 <a title="1189-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-Needed%3A__A_Billionaire_Candidate_for_President_Who_Shares_the_Views_of_a_Washington_Post_Columnist.html">885 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-Needed:  A Billionaire Candidate for President Who Shares the Views of a Washington Post Columnist</a></p>

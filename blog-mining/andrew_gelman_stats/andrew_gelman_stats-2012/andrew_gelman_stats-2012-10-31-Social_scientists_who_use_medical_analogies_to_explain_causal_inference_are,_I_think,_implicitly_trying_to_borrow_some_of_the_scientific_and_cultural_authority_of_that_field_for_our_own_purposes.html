<p>Introduction: Chris Schmid is a statistician at New England Medical Center who is an expert on evidence-based medicine.  I invited him to present an introductory overview lecture on the topic at last year’s Joint Statistical Meetings, and  here are his slides .  All 123 of them.  I don’t know how he expected to go though all of these in an hour.  You could teach a semester-long course based on this material.

<p>Introduction: Kevin Bryan wrote:
  
I read  your new article  on deduction/induction under Bayes.  There are a couple interesting papers from economic decision theory which are related that you might find interesting.
      
Samuelson et al have a (very) recent paper about what happens when you have some Bayesian and some non-Bayesian hypotheses.  (I  mentioned  this one on my blog earlier this year.)  Essentially, the Bayesian hypotheses are forced to “make predictions” in every future period (“if the unemployment rate is x%, the president is reelected with pr=x), whereas other forms of reasoning (say, analogies: “If the unemployment rate is above 10%, the president will not be reelected”).  Imagine you have some prior over, say, the economy and elections, with 99.9% of the hypotheses being Bayesian and the rest being analogies as above.  Then 100 years from now, because the analogies are so hard to refute, using deduction will push the proportion of Bayesian hypotheses toward zero.

 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: I’ve earlier written that  science is science communication —that is, the act of communicating scientific ideas and findings to ourselves and others is itself a central part of science.  My point was to push against a conventional separation between the act of science and the act of communication, the idea that science is done by scientists and communication is done by communicators.  It’s a rare bit of science that does not include communication as part of it.  As a scientist and science communicator myself, I’m particularly sensitive to devaluing of communication.  (For example, Bayesian Data Analysis is full of original research that was done in order to communicate; or, to put it another way, we often think we understand a scientific idea, but once we try to communicate it, we recognize gaps in our understanding that motivate further research.)
 
I once saw the following on one of those inspirational-sayings-for-every-day desk calendars: “To have ideas is to gather flowers.

<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.
  
I  disagreed , saying that Christakis wasn’t giving social science research enough credit:

<p>Introduction: Philosophy professor Gary Gutting  writes :
  
Public policy debates often involve appeals to results of work in social sciences like economics and sociology. . . . How much authority should we give to such work in our policy decisions? . . . The core natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) are so well established that we readily accept their best-supported conclusions as definitive. . . . But how reliable is even the best work on the effects of teaching?  How, for example, does it compare with the best work by biochemists on the effects of light on plant growth? Since humans are much more complex than plants and biochemists have far more refined techniques for studying plants, we may well expect the biochemical work to be far more reliable. . . . While the physical sciences produce many detailed and precise predictions, the social sciences do not.
  
OK, fine.  But then comes the punchline:

The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.

The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.
  
 The paper  appeared in the journal Health Policy.  From the abstract:

<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>5 0.92134053 <a title="1555-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel_modeling_and_instrumental_variables.html">1468 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel modeling and instrumental variables</a></p>

I was wondering if multilevel models can be used as an alternative to 2SLS or IV models to deal with (i) endogeneity and (ii) selection problems.


More concretely, I am trying to assess the impact of investment treaties on foreign investment. Aside from the fact that foreign investment is correlated over time, it may be the case that countries that already receive sufficient amounts of foreign investment need not sign treaties, and countries that sign treaties are those that need foreign investment in the first place. Countries thus “select” into treatment; treaty signing is non-random. As such, I argue that to properly estimate the impact of treaties on investment, we must model the determinants of treaty signing.


I [Teo] am currently modeling this as two separate models: (1) regress predictors on likelihood of treaty signing, (2) regress treaty (with interactions, etc) on investment (I’ve thought of using propensity score matching for this part of the model)</p><p>6 0.92101759 <a title="1555-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-04-Insecure_researchers_aren%E2%80%99t_sharing_their_data.html">991 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-04-Insecure researchers aren’t sharing their data</a></p>

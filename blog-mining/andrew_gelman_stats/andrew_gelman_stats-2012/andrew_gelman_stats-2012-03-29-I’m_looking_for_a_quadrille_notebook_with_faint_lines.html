I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.

<p>Introduction: I saw  this excellent art show  the other day, and it reminded me how much artistic talent is out there.  I really have no idea whassup with those all-black canvases and the other stuff you see at modern art museums, given that there’s so much interesting new stuff being created every year.  I see a big difference between art made by people who feel they have something they want to say, compared to art being made by people who feel they are supposed to make art because they’re artists.  And there’s also the internal logic of art responding to other art, as Tom Wolfe discussed in The Painted Word.</p><p>5 0.085183211 <a title="1235-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-21-Why_modern_art_is_all_in_the_mind.html">102 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-21-Why modern art is all in the mind</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”
  
This sounds fascinating.  But I’m skeptical about this part:

Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.

One of my colleagues suggested that I send you  this very short note  that I wrote on a new approach for displaying regression result uncertainty (attached). It’s very simple, and I’ve found it effective in one of my papers where I actually use it, but if you have a chance to glance over it and have any ideas for how to sell the approach or make it better, I’d be very interested to hear them. (Also, if you’ve seen that someone else has already made this point, I’d appreciate knowing that too.)

The matlab and stata functions I wrote, as well as the script that replicates my figures, are all posted on  my website .


Also, I just added options to the main matlab function (vwregress.m) to make it display the spaghetti plot (similar to what Lucas did, but a simple bootstrap) and the shaded CI that you suggested (see figs below). They’re good suggestions.


   


   


Personally, I [Hsiang] like the shaded CI better, since I think that all the visual activity in the spaghetti plot is a little distracting and sometimes adds visual weight in places where I wouldn’t want it.  But the option is there in case people like it.
  
Solomon then followed up with:

I can’t figure out what kind of regression this is, would you be so kind to enlighten me? 
The points represent (maturity,yield) of bonds.
  
My reply:  That’s a fun problem, reverse-engineering a curve fit!  My first guess is lowess, although it seems too flat and asympoty on the right side of the graph to be lowess.  Maybe a Gaussian process?  Looks too smooth to be a spline.  I guess I’ll go with my original guess, on the theory that lowess is the most accessible smoother out there, and if someone fit something much more complicated they’d make more of a big deal about it.  On the other hand, if the curve is an automatic output of some software (Excel? Stata?) then it could be just about anything.

<p>Introduction: I want a graph-paper-style notebook, ideally something lightweight—I’m looking to make notes, not art drawings—and not too large.  I’m currently using a 17 x 22 cm notebook, which is a fine size.  It also has pretty small squares, which I like.
 
My problem with the notebook I have now is that the ink is too heavy—that is, the lines are too dark.  I want very faint lines, just visible enough to be used as guides but not so heavy that to be overwhelming.
 
The notebooks I see in the stores all have pretty dark lines.  Any suggestions?</p><p>2 0.72842622 <a title="1235-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-GLM_%E2%80%93_exposure.html">271 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-GLM – exposure</a></p>

I am relatively new to glm models, anyhow, I am currently using your book “Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models” (pages 109-115). I am using a Poisson GLM model to analyse an aerial census dataset of wild herbivores on a ranch in Kenya. In my analysis I have the following variables:


 1. Outcome variable: count of wild herbivores sighted at a given location


 2. Explanatory variable1: vegetation type i.e. type of vegetation of the grid in which animals were sighted (the ranch is divided into 1x1km grids)


 3. Explanatory variable2: animal species e.g. eland, elephant, zebra etc


 4. Exposure: proximity to water i.e. distance (km) to the nearest water point


My questions are as follows:


1. Am I correct to include proximity to water point as an offset? I notice that in the example in your book the offset is a count, does this matter?


2. By including proximity to water in the model as an exposure am I correct to interpret th</p><p>3 0.71234107 <a title="1235-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-13-Retro_ethnic_slurs.html">1457 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-13-Retro ethnic slurs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Watership Down:
  
There is a rabbit saying, ‘In the warren, more stories than passages’; and a rabbit can no more refuse to tell a story than an Irishman can refuse to fight.
  
Wow. OK, if someone made a joke about New Yorkers being argumentative or people from Iowa being boring (sorry, Tom!), I wouldn’t see it as being in poor taste.  But somehow, to this non-U.K. reader, Adams’s remark about “Irishmen” seems a bit over the top.  I’m not criticizing it as offensive, exactly; it just is a bit jarring, and it’s kind of hard for me to believe someone would just write that as a throwaway line anymore.  Things have changed a lot since 1971, I guess, or maybe in England an Irish joke is no more offensive/awkward than a joke about corrupt Chicagoans, loopy Californians, or crazy Floridians would be here.</p><p>4 0.69312853 <a title="1235-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-24-Hey%E2%80%94has_anybody_done_this_study_yet%3F.html">1546 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-24-Hey—has anybody done this study yet?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  suggested  a research project to study how Americans define themselves in terms of regional identity.  For example, if you grew up in South Dakota but live in Washington, D.C., do you you call yourself a midwesterner, a westerner, a southerner, or what?  The analogy is to the paper by Michael Hout on “How 4 million Irish immigrants became 40 million Irish Americans.” Contrary to expectations, it wasn’t about prolific breeding, it was about how people of mixed background choose to classify themselves.</p><p>5 0.64374256 <a title="1235-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-05-Unrelated_to_all_else.html">129 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-05-Unrelated to all else</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another stereotype is affirmed when I go on the U.K. rail system webpage and it repeatedly times out on me.  At one point I have a browser open with the itinerary I’m interested in, and then awhile later I reopen the window (not clicking on anything on the page, just bringing the window up on the screen) but it’s timed out again.
 
P.S.  Yes, yes, I know that Amtrak is worse.  Still, it’s amusing to see a confirmation that, at least in one respect, the British trains are as bad as they say.</p><p>6 0.61740839 <a title="1235-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing_hardware.html">214 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing hardware</a></p>

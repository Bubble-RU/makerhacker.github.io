<p>Introduction: Basbøll  writes :
  
I [Basbøll] have got to come up with forty things to say [in the next few months]. . . .


What would you like me to write about?  I’ll of course be writing quite a bit about what I’m now calling “article design”, i.e., how to map out the roughly forty paragraphs that a journal article is composed of. And I’ll also be talking about how to plan the writing process that is to produce those paragraphs. The basic principle is still to write at least one paragraph a day in 27 minutes. (You can adapt this is various ways to your own taste; some like 18-minute or even 13-minute paragraphs.)


But I’d like to talk about questions of style, too, and even a little bit about epistemology. “Knowledge—academic knowledge, that is—is the ability to compose a coherent prose paragraph about something in 27 minutes,” I always say. I’d like to reflect a little more about what this conception of knowledge really means. This means I’ll have to walk back my recent dismissal of epistemol</p><p>3 0.20602545 <a title="1428-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-07-Not_much_difference_between_communicating_to_self_and_communicating_to_others.html">1408 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-07-Not much difference between communicating to self and communicating to others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
[Advertising executive] Russell Davies wrote a  blog post  called “The Tyranny of the Big Idea”. His five-point procedure begins:

 
Start doing stuff. Start executing things which seem right. Do it quickly and do it often. Don’t cling onto anything, good or bad. Don’t repeat much. Take what was good and do it differently.
 

And ends with: “And something else and something else.”
  
This inspires several thoughts, which I’ll take advantage of the blog format to present with no attempt to be cohesively organized.
 
1.  My first concern is the extent to which productivity-enhancing advice such as Davies’s (and Basbøll’s) is zero or even  negative-sum , just helping people in the rat race.  But, upon reflection, I’d rate the recommendations as positive-sum.  If people learn to write better and be more productive, that’s not (necessarily) just positional.
 
2.  Blogging fits with the “Do it quickly and do it often” advice.
 
3.  I wonder what Basbøll thinks abo</p><p>4 0.19847856 <a title="1428-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-09-Advice%3A__positive-sum%2C_zero-sum%2C_or_negative-sum.html">2287 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-09-Advice:  positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there. I offer some of it myself!  As I’ve written before (see  this post from 2008  reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and  this post from 2010  reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
It’s time to play the game again.  This time it’s  advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas  for Ph.D. students.  I’ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum: 
  
  
1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up. 
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride. 
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication. Don’t h</p><p>5 0.1756804 <a title="1428-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-19-Believe_your_models_%28up_to_the_point_that_you_abandon_them%29.html">1269 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-19-Believe your models (up to the point that you abandon them)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a discussion of his variant of the write-a-thousand-words-a-day strategy (as he puts it, “a system for the production of academic results in writing”), Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
Believe the claims you are making. That is, confine yourself to making claims you believe. I always emphasize this when I [Basbøll] define knowledge as “justified, true belief”. . . . I think if there is one sure way to undermine your sense of your own genius it is to begin to say things you know to be publishable without being sure they are true. Or even things you know to be “true” but don’t understand well enough to believe.
  
He points out that this is not so easy:
  
In times when there are strong orthodoxies it can sometimes be difficult to know what to believe. Or, rather, it is all too easy to know what to believe (what the “right belief” is). It is therefore difficult to stick to statements of one’s own belief. I sometimes worry that our universities, which are systems of formal education and for</p><p>6 0.16227609 <a title="1428-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-15-Advice_that_might_make_sense_for_individuals_but_is_negative-sum_overall.html">278 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-15-Advice that might make sense for individuals but is negative-sum overall</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

They are both endurance events, they last a long time and they require a consistent and carefully calculated amount of effor</p><p>3 0.88278502 <a title="1428-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-07-Free_advice_from_an_academic_writing_coach%21.html">1658 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-07-Free advice from an academic writing coach!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In high school and college I would write long assignments using a series of outlines.  I’d start with a single sheet where I’d write down the key phrases, connect them with lines, and then write more and more phrases until the page was filled up.  Then I’d write a series of outlines, culminating in a sentence-level outline that was roughly one line per sentence of the paper.  Then I’d write.  It worked pretty well.  Or horribly, depending on how you look at it.  I was able to produce 10-page papers etc. on time.  But I think it crippled my writing style for years.  It’s taken me a long time to learn how to write directly–to explain clearly what I’ve done and why.  And I’m still working on the “why” part.  There’s a thin line between verbosity and terseness.
 
I went to MIT and my roommate was a computer science major.  He wrote me a word processor on his Atari 800, which did the job pretty well.  For my senior thesis I broke down and used the computers in campus.

<p>Introduction: Reading  this  amusing book review on willpower by Will Self ( link  from Jenny Davidson) reminds me that recently [actually, several months ago; recall that most of this blog is published on a delay], I felt frustrated that I wasn’t getting anything done.  I think that when I write this sort of thing it annoys people, because I’m lucky enough to be in a position to get a lot done—projects ranging from the ethics column to Stan—but I get frustrated when I spend a week trying to work, and then when the week’s over, I realize that all I did was respond to emails, review a bunch of journal submissions and grant proposals, and spend a lot of time staring into space while putting off whatever it was that I really thought I should be doing.
 
I thought and thought, and I decided that my best strategy is what I call  positive procrastination .  Procrastination is of course typically considered a bad thing (or, as ironic-style writers would write, a Bad Thing).  But you can actually use it, ju</p><p>6 0.85027313 <a title="1428-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-07-Not_much_difference_between_communicating_to_self_and_communicating_to_others.html">1408 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-07-Not much difference between communicating to self and communicating to others</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A  comment  by Mark Palko reminded me that, while I’m a huge  Marquand  fan, I think The Late George Apley is way overrated.  My theory is that Marquand’s best books don’t fit into the modernist way of looking about literature, and that the gatekeepers of the 1930s and 1940s, when judging Marquand by these standards, conveniently labeled Apley has his best book because it had a form–Edith-Wharton-style satire–that they could handle.  In contrast, Point of No Return and all the other classics are a mixture of seriousness and satire that left critics uneasy.
 
Perhaps there’s a way to study this sort of thing more systematically?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93601024 <a title="1428-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-25-The_problem_with_realistic_advice%3F.html">1428 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-25-The problem with realistic advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>3 0.92714286 <a title="1428-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-01-References_on_predicting_elections.html">249 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-01-References on predicting elections</a></p>

I [Axelrod] am interested in building a model that predicts voting on the precinct level, using variables such as party registration, age, sex, income etc. Surely political scientists have worked on this problem.


I would be grateful for any reference you could provide in the way of articles and books.
  
My reply:  Political scientists have worked on this problem, and it’s easy enough to imagine hierarchical models of the sort discussed in my book with Jennifer. I can picture what I would do if asked to forecast at the precinct level, for example to model exit polls.  (In fact, I was briefly hired by the exit poll consortium in 2000 to do this, but then after I told them about hierarchical Bayes, they un-hired me!)  But I don’t actually know of any literature on precinct-level forecasting.

Here’s another query to add to the stats backlog…Minimum Description Length (MDL).  I’m  attaching  a 2002 Psych Rev paper on same.  Basically, it’s an approach to model selection that replaces goodness of fit with generalizability or complexity.


Would be great to get your response to this approach.
  
My reply:
 
I’ve heard about the minimum description length principle for a long time but have never really understood it.  So I have nothing to say!  Anyone who has anything useful to say on the topic, feel free to add in the comments.

<p>Introduction: Corey Yanofsky writes:
  
In your work, you’ve robustificated logistic regression by having the logit function saturate at, e.g., 0.01 and 0.99, instead of  0 and 1. Do you have any thoughts on a sensible setting for the saturation values? My intuition suggests that it has something to do with proportion of outliers expected in the data (assuming a reasonable model fit). 


It would be desirable to have them fit in the model, but my intuition is that integrability of the posterior distribution might become an issue.
  
My reply:  it should be no problem to put these saturation values in the model, I bet it would work fine in Stan if you give them uniform (0,.1) priors or something like that.  Or you could just fit the robit model.
 
And this reminds me . . . I’ve been told that when Stan’s on its optimization setting, it fits generalized linear models just about as fast as regular glm or bayesglm in R.  This suggests to me that we should have some precompiled regression models in Stan,</p><p>6 0.90931439 <a title="1428-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian_inference_for_the_parameter_of_a_uniform_distribution.html">979 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian inference for the parameter of a uniform distribution</a></p>

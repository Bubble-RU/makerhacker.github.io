Thanks to Cord Blomquist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all.  You may have noticed changes in the appearance of the blog.   Cord Blomquist  moved us over to this new WordPress blog.  He earlier did it for our sister blog and he can do it for you too, for a reasonable fee.  We had a few hitches in getting all the files and links and comments working, and Cord was with us all the way to straighten things out.  Thanks, Cord!  You did a great job and we’re happy to recommend you to others.
 
P.S.  The last thing we got working was the RSS feed.  So if you’ve been reading the blog on RSS, you have about 3 weeks of backlog you can catch up on.
 
P.P.S.  We’re still playing a bit with the blog’s formatting.  Feel free to put any formatting suggestions in the comments.</p><p>3 0.11906797 <a title="1530-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-02-The_blog_is_back.html">1559 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-02-The blog is back</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.

<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>4 0.68181211 <a title="1530-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-17-Read_this_blog_on_Google_Currents.html">1065 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-17-Read this blog on Google Currents</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Bruce Mannheim  reports  that a recent well-publicized study on the genetics of native Americans, which used genetic analysis to find “at least three streams of Asian gene flow,” is in fact a confirmation of a long-known fact.  Mannheim writes:
  
This three-way distinction was known linguistically since the 1920s (for example, Sapir 1921). Basically, it’s a division among the Eskimo-Aleut languages, which straddle the Bering Straits even today, the Athabaskan languages (which were discovered to be related to a small Siberian language family only within the last few years, not by Greenberg as Wade suggested), and everything else.
  
This is not to say that the results from genetics are unimportant, but it’s good to see how it fits with other aspects of our understanding.</p><p>2 0.93347609 <a title="1530-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-05-Fattening_of_the_world_and_good_use_of_the_alpha_channel.html">558 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-05-Fattening of the world and good use of the alpha channel</a></p>

Good news: the rate of fattening of the USA appears to be slowing down. Maybe because of high gas prices?

<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

<p>Introduction: I was updating my Mac and noticed the following:
 
 
 
Lots of obscure European languages there.  That got me wondering:  what’s the least obscure language  not  on the above list?  Igbo?  Swahili?  Or maybe Tagalog?
 
I did a quick google and found  this  list of languages by number of native speakers.  Once you see the list, the answer is obvious:  Hindi, first language of 295 million people, is not on Apple’s list.  The next most popular languages not included:  Bengali, Punjabi, Javanese, Wu, Telegu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu.  Wow:  most of these are Indian!  Then comes Persian and a bunch of others.
 
It turns out that Tagalog, Igbo, and Swahili, are way down on this list with 28 million, 24 million, and 26 million native speakers, respectively.
 
Only 26 million for Swahili?  This made me want to check the  list of languages by total number of speakers .  The ranking of most of the languages isn’t much different, but Swahili is now #10, at 140 million.  Hindi and Bengali are still th</p><p>5 0.87014461 <a title="1530-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-26-Luck_or_knowledge%3F.html">873 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-26-Luck or knowledge?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

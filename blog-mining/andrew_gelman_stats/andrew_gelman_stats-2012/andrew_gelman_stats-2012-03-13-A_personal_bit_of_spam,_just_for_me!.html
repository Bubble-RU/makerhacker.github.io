<p>Introduction: X pointed me to  this  atrocity:
  
The data on obesity are pretty unequivocal: we’re fat, and we’re getting fatter. Explanations for this trend, however, vary widely, with the blame alternately pinned on individual behaviour, genetics and the environment. In other words, it’s a race between “we eat too much”, “we’re born that way” and “it’s society’s fault”. 
Now, research by Lazaros Gallos has come down strongly in favour of the third option. Gallos and his colleagues at City College of New York treated the obesity rates in some 3000 US counties as “particles” in a physical system, and calculated the correlation between pairs of “particles” as a function of the distance between them. . . . the data indicated that the size of the “obesity cities” – geographic regions with correlated obesity rates – was huge, up to 1000 km. . . .
  
Just to be clear:  I have no problem with people calculating spatial autocorrelations (or even with them using quaint terminology such as referring to coun</p><p>3 0.13241057 <a title="1211-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-02-Another_retraction.html">1359 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-02-Another retraction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email:  
  
Howdy Andrew,


Hope you’re keeping well! I was wondering if you’re open to guest posts at Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science – if you are interested, I can offer an original 500-1000 word, very high quality article in fitting with the site. All research and writing will be carried out by a professional writer (namely, me) and once approved it will be entirely yours to place on the site as you see fit.


I can choose a title for the article or you can suggest one and I’ll work around that. Normally I write for property and travel sites (particularly cruise and ski related), but I’m game for anything if you’re happy to entertain me. I can also include some copyright-free and high quality pictures related to the blog post.


You’re probably wondering what’s in it for me, which is a fair question – in return, all I’d ask is a subtle link back in return. Other than that, the material itself would be non-commericial</p><p>5 0.081206009 <a title="1211-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-18-Tips_on_%E2%80%9Cgreat_design%E2%80%9D_from_._._._Microsoft%21.html">1219 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-18-Tips on “great design” from . . . Microsoft!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  this  (link from  here ):
  
A post . . . reminded me of a great technique I [@destraynor] learned about from Bill Buxton. Bill is a Principal Researcher in Microsoft where his main role focuses on designing a company that permits great design to happen. As many have learned to their peril, it’s not simply a case of just dumping talent in a room full of Ikea furniture. In large companies you have to design the process that creates design. One key idea Bill advocates is an emphasis on exploring the solution space before iterating on a solution. . . .
  
It goes on from there, but all I could think of was . . . this must be the first time the words “Microsoft” and “a company that permits great design to happen” have ever appeared in the same sentence.  Sure, Clippy was great and Windows Vista has changed how we think about the world, but what great things has Microsoft done lately?

Greetings, 
My name is Bryan Clark, and I’m a big fan of your writing. I contacted you because I think I have a mutually beneficial agreement that will allow you to make additional money for articles you are already writing online. Let me give you an idea of how we can help each other. 
We’re looking for writers that can help increase the profile of our clients by linking to them within the context of their articles. The clients are huge, and we generally have one that can fit naturally in the context of most article niches. 
In return, we pay generously for a single link for our clients. 
If you are interested, I’d love to talk about it more.

Bryan Clark

Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).

<p>Introduction: Some asshole who has a bug up his ass about compressed sensing is spamming our  comments  with a bunch of sock puppets.  All from the same IP address:  “George Stoneriver,” Scott Wolfe,” and just plain “Paul,”  all saying pretty much the same thing in the same sort of broken English (except for Paul, whose post was too short to do a dialect analysis). “Scott Wolfe” is a generic sort of name, but a quick google search reveals nothing related to this topic. “George Stoneriver” seems to have no internet presence at all (besides the comments at this blog).  As for “Paul,” I don’t know, maybe the spammer was too lazy to invent a last name?
 
Our spammer spends about half his time slamming the field of compressed sensing and the other half pumping up the work of someone named Xiteng Liu.  There’s no excuse for this behavior.  It’s horrible, a true abuse of our scholarly community.

<p>Introduction: Hi Andrew,


I came across your site while searching for blogs and posts around American obesity and wanted to reach out to get your readership’s feedback on an infographic my team built which focuses on the obesity of America and where we could end up at the going rate.


If you’re interested, let’s connect. Have a great weekend!


Thanks.

I have to say, that’s pretty pitiful, to wish someone a “great weekend” on a Tuesday!  This guy’s gotta ratchet up his sophistication a few notches if he ever wants to get a job as a spammer for a  major software company , for example.</p><p>2 0.92824411 <a title="1211-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians_vs._everybody_else.html">582 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians vs. everybody else</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Statisticians are literalists.
 
When someone says that the U.K. boundary commission’s delay in redistricting gave the Tories an advantage equivalent to 10 percent of the vote, we’re the kind of person who  looks it up  and claims that the effect is less than 0.7 percent.
 
When someone says, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican presidents in times of perceived danger and Democrats in times of relative calm,” we’re like, Hey, really?  And we go look  that one  up too.
 
And when someone says that engineers have more sons and nurses have more daughters . . . well, let’s not go there.
 
So, when I was pointed to  this blog  by Michael O’Hare making the following claim, in the context of K-12 education in the United States:
  
My [O'Hare's] favorite examples of this junk [educational content with no workplace value] are spelling and pencil-and-paper algorithm arithmetic. These are absolutely critical for a clerk</p><p>3 0.92329562 <a title="1211-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-17-ff.html">418 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-17-ff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>4 0.9163335 <a title="1211-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-25-Incoherence_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">1510 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-25-Incoherence of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hogg writes:
  
At the end  this article  you wonder about consistency.  Have you ever considered the possibility that utility might resolve some of the problems?  I have no idea if it 
would—I am not advocating that position—I just get some kind of intuition from phrases like “Judgment is required to decide…”. Perhaps there is a coherent and objective description of what is—or could be—done under a coherent “utility” model (like a utility that could be objectively agreed upon and computed).  Utilities are usually subjective—true—but priors are usually subjective too.
  
My reply:
 
I’m happy to think about utility, for some particular problem or class of problems going to the effort of assigning costs and benefits to different outcomes.  I agree that a utility analysis, even if (necessarily) imperfect, can usefully focus discussion.  For example, if a statistical method for selecting variables is justified on the basis of cost, I like the idea of attempting to quantify the costs of ga</p><p>5 0.91264653 <a title="1211-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-06-Comparing_people_from_two_surveys%2C_one_of_which_is_a_simple_random_sample_and_one_of_which_is_not.html">1523 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-06-Comparing people from two surveys, one of which is a simple random sample and one of which is not</a></p>

I’m helping a professor out with an analysis, and I was hoping that you might be able to point me to some relevant literature…  She has two studies that have been completed already (so we can’t go back to the planning stage in terms of sampling, unfortunately).  Both studies are based around the population of adults in LA who attended LA public high schools at some point, so that is the same for both studies.  Study #1 uses random digit dialing, so I consider that one to be SRS.  Study #2, however, is a convenience sample in which all participants were involved with one of eight community-based organizations (CBOs).


Of course, both studies can be analyzed independently, but she was hoping for there to be some way to combine/compare the two studies.  Specifically, I am working on looking at the civic engagement of the adults in both studies.  In study #1, this means looking at factors such as involvement in student government.  In study #2, this means looking at involv</p><p>6 0.9125182 <a title="1211-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-02-Fishing_for_cherries.html">1746 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-02-Fishing for cherries</a></p>

<h1>1484 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-05-Two exciting movie ideas:  “Second Chance U” and “The New Dirty Dozen”</h1>
<br/><h2>meta infos for this blog</h2><p>Source: <a title="andrew_gelman_stats-2012-1484-html" href="http://andrewgelman.com/2012/09/05/two-exciting-movie-ideas-second-chance-u-and-the-new-dirty-dozen/">html</a></p><p>Introduction: I have a great idea for a movie.  Actually two movies based on two variants of a similar idea.
 
It all started when I saw this story:
  
Dr. Anil Potti, the controversial cancer researcher whose work at Duke University led to lawsuits from patients, is now a medical oncologist at the Cancer Center of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
  
When asked about Dr. Potti’s controversial appointment, his new boss  said :
  
If a guy can’t get a second chance here in North Dakota, where he trained, man, you can’t get a second chance anywhere.
  
(Link from  Retraction Watch , of course.)
 
Potti’s boss is also quoted as saying, “Most, if not all, his patients have loved him.”  On the other hand, the news article reports: “The North Carolina medical board’s website lists settlements against Potti of at least $75,000.”  I guess there’s no reason you can’t love a guy and still want a juicy malpractice settlement.

<p>Introduction: I just finished reading an amusing but somewhat disturbing  article  by Mark Singer, a reporter for the New Yorker who follows in that magazine’s tradition of writing about amiable frauds.  (For those who are keeping score at home, Singer employs a McKelway-style relaxed tolerance rather than Liebling-style pyrotechnics.)  Singer’s topic was a midwestern dentist named Kip Litton who fradulently invented a side career for himself as a sub-3-hour marathoner.  What was amazing was not so much that Litton lied about his accomplishments but, rather, the huge efforts that he undertook to support these lies.  He went to faraway cities to not run marathons.  He fabricated multiple personas on running message boards.  He even invented an entire marathon and made up a list of participants.
 
This got me thinking about Ed Wegman (sorry!), the statistician who got tangled in a  series of plagiarism scandals .

<p>Introduction: A  correspondent  writes:
  
A brief update on the  Stapel scandal . It seems that the Dutch universities involved were really determined to get to the bottom of this. A first part of the outcomes of the investigations are online (in English).  Several “commissions” or “committees” (I guess no proper English but this is the way scandals are sorted out in Dutch politics too) were established to investigate the matter.


The first commission to report is the commissie Levelt:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/


The most interesting part is this I guess:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/levelt-committee/fraud-determined/ 


This concerns only the articles investigated by that commission. The others (Noort and Drenth) are expected to report in the coming months.


I [the correspondent] feel sorry for Stapel, but the amount of fraud is sizeable. I like the way the universities handle this—especially that they are fairly transparent.

<p>Introduction: Amy Hundley writes in the New Yorker about a notorious recent case of unacknowledged literary  quilting :
  
I [Hundley] was the editor at Grove/Atlantic to whom Quentin Rowan’s novel “Appearance and the Park” was submitted (“The Plagiarist’s Tale,” by Lizzie Widdicombe, February 13th & 20th). Widdicombe writes that the editor in question thought that “its plot was too close to that of another of the house’s books, ‘My Idea of Fun,’ by Will Self,” and I can only assume that this explanation came from Rowan. In fact, Rowan had lifted a passage nearly verbatim from Will Self’s novella “The Sweet Smell of Psychosis.” It was an especially delicious one, in which Self describes the media denizens of a particular bar. I recognized it immediately and informed his agent that he’d plagiarized it. Writing a plot similar to a successful novelist’s—something that can arise innocently—is very different from plagiarizing. Appropriating and remixing someone else’s work while acknowledging sources is</p><p>6 0.78860879 <a title="1484-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-01-%24241%2C364.83_%E2%80%93_%2413%2C000_%3D_%24228%2C364.83.html">1600 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-01-$241,364.83 – $13,000 = $228,364.83</a></p>

A colleague of mine and I are doing a presentation for new faculty on a number of topics related to teaching.  Our charge is to identify interesting issues and to find research-based information for them about how to approach things.  So, what I wondered is, do you know of any published research dealing with the sort of issues about structuring a course and final exam in the ways you talk about in  this blog post ?  Some poking around in the usual places hasn’t turned anything up yet.
  
I don’t really know the psychometrics literature but I imagine that some good stuff has been written on principles of test design. There are probably some good papers from back in the 1920s.

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

<p>Introduction: When predicting 0/1 data we can use logit (or probit or robit or some other robust model such as invlogit (0.01 + 0.98*X*beta)).  Logit is simple enough and we can use  bayesglm  to regularize and avoid the problem of separation.
 
What if there are more than 2 categories?  If they’re ordered (1, 2, 3, etc), we can do ordered logit (and use bayespolr() to avoid separation).  If the categories are unordered (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), there are unordered multinomial logit and probit models out there.
 
But it’s not so easy to fit these multinomial model in a multilevel setting (with coefficients that vary by group), especially if the computation is embedded in an iterative routine such as mi where you have real time constraints at each step.
 
So this got me wondering whether we could kluge it with logits.  Here’s the basic idea (in the ordered and unordered forms):
 
- If you have a variable that goes 1, 2, 3, etc., set up a series of logits:  1 vs. 2,3,…; 2 vs. 3,…; and so forth</p><p>4 0.91429305 <a title="1484-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles_of_criminal_justice.html">1621 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles of criminal justice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

<p>Introduction: Sharon Jayson  writes :
  
The conventional wisdom that’s developed over the past few decades — based on early research — has said parents are less happy, more depressed and have less-satisfying marriages than their childless counterparts.


But now, two new studies presented as part of the Population Association of America’s annual meeting suggest that earlier findings in several studies weren’t so clear-cut and may, in fact, be flawed. The newer analyses presented this week use analytical methods based on data from almost 130,000 adults around the globe — including more than 52,000 parents — and the conclusions aren’t so grim. They say that parents today may indeed be happier than non-parents and that parental happiness levels — while they do drop — don’t dip below the levels they were before having children. . . .

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>4 0.26217362 <a title="1360-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-01-A_graph_at_war_with_its_caption.__Also%2C_how_to_visualize_the_same_numbers_without_giving_the_display_a_misleading_causal_feel%3F.html">1834 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-01-A graph at war with its caption.  Also, how to visualize the same numbers without giving the display a misleading causal feel?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  discusses  the following  graph  that is captioned, “A study of 54 nations–ranked below–found that those with more progressive tax rates had happier citizens, on average.”
 
   
 
As Kaiser writes, “from a purely graphical perspective, the chart is well executed . . . they have 54 points, and the chart still doesn’t look too crammed . . .”  But he also points out that the graph’s implicit claims (that tax rates can explain happiness or cause more happiness) are not supported.
 
Kaiser and I are not being picky-picky-picky here.  Taken literally, the graph title says nothing about causation, but I think the phrasing implies it.  Also, from a purely descriptive perspective, the graph is somewhat at war with its caption.  The caption announces a relationship, but in the graph, the x and y variables have only a very weak correlation.  The caption says that happiness and progressive tax rates go together, but the graph uses the U.S. as a baseline, and when you move from the U.S</p><p>5 0.21205513 <a title="1360-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.

 Core tasks include preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning house, shopping, and washing and ironing; non-core tasks include outdoor work, paying bills, auto maintenance, and driving. 


As you can see in the graph, the more of the “core” tasks a man completes, the less sex he gets.

<p>Introduction: From “Judge Savage,” by Tim Parks:
  
That evening, Daniel called Hilary’s parents.  These people always disliked me, he knew.  He had never understood if it was a racial thing, or whether they would have disliked any partner of Hilary’s.
  
Very clever.  Parks demonstrates Daniel’s blind spot–he can’t imagine that maybe Hilary’s parents hate him because of his unpleasant personality–but does it entirely from Daniel’s perspective.  I wonder if this just came naturally to Parks, or whether he figured it out as a puzzle to solve–how to convey a blind spot from the perspective of the person looking and not noticing it–or whether Parks wasn’t thinking at all about this and it just happened.
 
Considering the character Daniel’s psychology, I’d consider the above as an example of the so-called fundamental attribution error, in that he’s attributing Hilary’s parents dislike of him to situational factors rather than to his own personality.
 
I’ll have more on “Judge Savage” later (on the topic</p><p>3 0.87147939 <a title="1360-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-06-Leahy_Versus_Albedoman_and_the_Moneygoround%2C_Part_One.html">1885 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-06-Leahy Versus Albedoman and the Moneygoround, Part One</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edward Wyatt  reports :
  
Now the Obama administration is cracking down on what many call  patent trolls , shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid . . . “The United States patent system is vital for our economic growth, job creation, and technological advance,” [Senator] Leahy said in a statement. “Unfortunately, misuse of low-quality patents through patent trolling has tarnished the system’s image.”
  
There is some opposition:
  
But some big software companies, including Microsoft, expressed dismay at some of the proposals, saying they could themselves stifle innovation.
  
Microsoft . . . patent trolls . . . hmmm, where have we heard this connection  before ?
 
There is also some support for the bill:

<p>Introduction: Xian and I respond to the four discussants of our paper, “Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference.”  Here’s the abstract of  our rejoinder :
  
Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood. The present article arose from our memory of a particularly intemperate anti-Bayesian statement that appeared in Feller’s beautiful and classic book on probability theory. We felt that it was worth exploring the very extremeness of Feller’s words, along with similar anti-Bayesian remarks by others, in order to better understand the background underlying contr</p><p>5 0.83959889 <a title="1360-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-07-Bechdel_wasn%E2%80%99t_kidding.html">701 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-07-Bechdel wasn’t kidding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog know about  the Bechdel test  for movies:
 
1. It has to have at least two women in it 
2. Who talk to each other 
3. About something besides a man
 
Amusing, huh?  But I only really got the point the other day, when I was on a plane and passively watched parts of the in-flight movie.  It was something I’d never heard of (of course) and it happened to be a chick flick–even without the soundtrack, it was clear that the main character was a woman and much of it was about her love life.  But even this movie failed the Bechdel test miserably!  I don’t even think it passed item #1 above, but if it did, it certainly failed #2.
 
If even the chick flicks are failing the Bechdel test, then, yeah, we’re really in trouble.  And don’t get me started on those old Warner Brothers cartoons.  They’re great but they feature about as many female characters as the average WWII submarine.  Sure, everybody knows this, but it’s still striking to think about just how unbalanced</p><p>6 0.81456447 <a title="1360-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-Blog_in_motion.html">790 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-Blog in motion</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alban Zeber writes:
  
 
Suppose I have survey data from  say 10 countries where by each country collected the data based on different sampling routines –  the results of this being that  each country has its own weights for the data that can be used in the analyses. If I analyse the data of each country separately then I can incorporate the survey design in the analyses e.g in Stata once can use svyset …..


But what happens when I want to do a pooled analysis of the all the data from the 10 countries:


Presumably either 


1.  I analyse the data from each country separately (using multiple or logistic regression, …) accounting for the survey design and then combine the estimates using a meta analysis (fixed or random)


  OR


2.  Assume that the data from each country is a simple random sample from the population, combine the data from the 10 countries and then use multilevel or hierarchical models

<p>Introduction: Having established that survey weighting is a mess, I should also acknowledge that, by this standard, regression modeling is also a mess, involving many arbitrary choices of variable selection, transformations and modeling of interaction. Nonetheless, regression modeling is a mess with which I am comfortable and, perhaps more relevant to the discussion, can be extended using multilevel models to get inference for small cross-classifications or small areas.

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.
 
 Solution to question 27

<p>Introduction: I received the following question:
  
Is there a classic paper on instrumenting for survey non-response?  some colleagues in public health are going to carry out a survey and I wonder about suggesting that they build in a randomization of response-encouragement (e.g. offering additional $ to a subset of those who don’t respond initially).  Can you recommend a basic treatment of this, and why it might or might not make sense compared to IPW using covariates (without an instrument)?
  
My reply:   Here’s  the best analysis I know of on the effects of incentives for survey response.  There have been several survey-experiments on the subject.  The short answer is that the effect on nonresponse is small and the outcome is highly variable, hence you can’t very well use it as an instrument in any particular survey.
 
My recommended approach to dealing with nonresponse is to use multilevel regression and poststratification; an example is  here .

<p>Introduction: From a comment I made in an email exchange:
 
My  work  on survey adjustments has very much been inspired by the ideas of Rod Little.  Much of my efforts have gone toward the goal of integrating hierarchical modeling (which is so helpful for small-area estimation) with post stratification (which adjusts for known differences between sample and population).  In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.
 
As I wrote in the first sentence of the above-linked paper, I do think the current theory and practice of survey weighting is a mess, in that much depends on so</p><p>2 0.95567179 <a title="1430-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-16-%E2%80%9CFalse-positive_psychology%E2%80%9D.html">1171 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-16-“False-positive psychology”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happene</p><p>4 0.95031631 <a title="1430-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-13-%E2%80%9CWhat_are_some_situations_in_which_the_classical_approach_%28or_a_naive_implementation_of_it%2C_based_on_cookbook_recipes%29_gives_worse_results_than_a_Bayesian_approach%2C_results_that_actually_impeded_the_science%3F%E2%80%9D.html">2099 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-13-“What are some situations in which the classical approach (or a naive implementation of it, based on cookbook recipes) gives worse results than a Bayesian approach, results that actually impeded the science?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Phil Nelson writes in the context of a biostatistics textbook he is writing, “Physical models of living systems”:
  
There are a number of classic statistical problems that arise every day in the lab, and which are discussed in any book:


1. In a control group, M untreated rats out of 20 got a form of cancer. In a test group, N treated rats out of 20 got that cancer. Is this a significant difference? 
2. In a control group of 20 untreated rates, their body weights at 2 weeks were w_1,…, w_20. In a test group of 20 treated rats, their body weights at 2 weeks were w’_1,…, w’_20. Are the means significantly different? 
3. In a group of 20 rats, each given dose d_i of a drug, their body weights at 2 weeks were w_i. Is there a significant correlation between d and w?

Okay, have done due diligence here & can’t find the reference. It was in recent blog — and was more or less an aside — but you ripped into researchers (pretty sure econometricians, but this could be my memory adding to your account recollections it conjured from my own experience) who purport to make estimates or predictions based on multivariate regression in which the value of particular predictor is set at some level while others “held constant” etc., on ground that variance in that particular predictor independent of covariance in other model predictors is unrealistic.  You made it sound, too, as if this were one of the pet peeves in your menagerie — leading me to think you had blasted into it before.


Know what I’m talking about?


Also — isn’t this really just a way of saying that the model is misspecified — at least if the goal is to try to make a valid & unbiased estimate of the impact of that particular predictor?

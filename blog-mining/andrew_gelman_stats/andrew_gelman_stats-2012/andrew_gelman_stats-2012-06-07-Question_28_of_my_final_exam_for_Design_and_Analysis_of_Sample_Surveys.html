<p>Introduction: From a comment I made in an email exchange:
 
My  work  on survey adjustments has very much been inspired by the ideas of Rod Little.  Much of my efforts have gone toward the goal of integrating hierarchical modeling (which is so helpful for small-area estimation) with post stratification (which adjusts for known differences between sample and population).  In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.
 
As I wrote in the first sentence of the above-linked paper, I do think the current theory and practice of survey weighting is a mess, in that much depends on so</p><p>4 0.23159829 <a title="1371-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Ethical_and_data-integrity_problems_in_a_study_of_mortality_in_Iraq.html">5 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Ethical and data-integrity problems in a study of mortality in Iraq</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design. The paper also presents some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories. This evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or</p><p>5 0.21922745 <a title="1371-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic_screening_to_get_an_approximate_self-weighted_sample.html">1455 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic screening to get an approximate self-weighted sample</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharad had a survey sampling question:
  
We’re trying to use mechanical turk to conduct some surveys, and have quickly discovered that turkers tend to be quite young. We’d really like a representative sample of the U.S., or at the least be able to recruit a diverse enough sample from turk that we can post-stratify to adjust the estimates. The approach we ended up taking is to pay turkers a small amount to answer a couple of screening questions (age & sex), and then probabilistically recruit individuals to complete the full survey (for more money) based on the estimated turk population parameters and our desired target distribution. We use rejection sampling, so the end result is that individuals who are invited to take the full survey look as if they came from a representative sample, at least in terms of age and sex. I’m wondering whether this sort of technique—a two step design in which participants are first screened and then probabilistically selected to mimic a target distributio</p><p>6 0.20898663 <a title="1371-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-01-Weighting_and_prediction_in_sample_surveys.html">784 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-01-Weighting and prediction in sample surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

<p>Introduction: 4. Researchers have found that survey respondents overreport church attendance. Thus, naive estimates from surveys overstate the percentage of Americans who attend church regularly. Does this have a large impact on estimates of time trends in religious attendance?
 
 Solution to question 3 
 
From  yesterday :
  
3. We discussed in class the best currently available method for estimating the proportion of military servicemembers who are gay. What is that method? (Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)
  
Solution:  I was talking about the  work  of Gary Gates, combining an estimate of the percentage of gays in the population with an estimate of the probability that someone is in the military, given that he or she is gay.</p><p>3 0.84103578 <a title="1371-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-10-Some_interesting_unpublished_ideas_on_survey_weighting.html">705 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-10-Some interesting unpublished ideas on survey weighting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago we had an amazing all-star session at the Joint Statistical Meetings.  The topic was new approaches to survey weighting (which is  a mess , as I’m sure you’ve heard).
 
Xiao-Li Meng  recommended shrinking weights by taking them to a fractional power (such as square root) instead of trimming the extremes. 
 
Rod Little  combined design-based and model-based survey inference. 
 
Michael Elliott  used mixture models for complex survey design. 
 
And here’s  my introduction  to the session.</p><p>4 0.83565897 <a title="1371-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-18-Is_it_really_true_that_only_8%25_of_people_who_buy_Herbalife_products_are_Herbalife_distributors%3F.html">1679 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-18-Is it really true that only 8% of people who buy Herbalife products are Herbalife distributors?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>5 0.82625932 <a title="1371-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-01-Weighting_and_prediction_in_sample_surveys.html">784 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-01-Weighting and prediction in sample surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Livengood writes:
  
There has been some discussion about the recent PISA results (in which the U.S. comes out pretty badly), for example  here  and  here .  The claim being made is that the poor U.S. scores are due to rampant individual- or family-level poverty in the U.S.  They claim that when one controls for poverty, the U.S. comes out on top in the PISA standings, and then they infer that poverty causes poor test scores.  The further inference is then that the U.S. could improve education by the “simple” action of reducing poverty.  Anyway, I was wondering what you thought about their analysis.
  
My reply:  I agree this is interesting and I agree it’s hard to know exactly what to say about these comparisons.  When I’m stuck in this sort of question, I ask, WWJD?  In this case, I think Jennifer would ask what are the potential interventions being considered. Various ideas for changing the school system would perhaps have different effects on different groups of students.</p><p>2 0.97358143 <a title="1371-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Question_21_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1356 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Question 21 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions.. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
 
 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>3 0.97011703 <a title="1371-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-20-Problemen_met_het_boek.html">1332 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-20-Problemen met het boek</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regarding the so-called Dutch Book argument for Bayesian inference (the idea that, if your inferences do not correspond to a Bayesian posterior distribution, you can be forced to make incoherent bets and ultimately become a money pump), I wrote:
 
I have never found this argument appealing, because a bet is a game not a decision.  A bet requires 2 players, and one player has to offer the bets.  I do agree that in some bounded settings (for example, betting on win place show in a horse race), I’d want my bets to be coherent; if they are incoherent (e.g., if my bets correspond to P(A|B)*P(B) not being equal to P(A,B)), then I should be able to do better by examining the incoherence.  But in an “open system” (to borrow some physics jargon), I don’t think coherence is possible.  There is always new information coming in, and there is always additional prior information in reserve that hasn’t entered the model.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.96982765 <a title="1371-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Question_28_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1371 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Question 28 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live. (The calculation is based on the chance that your district’s vote will be exactly tied, along with the chance that your di</p><p>6 0.96950501 <a title="1371-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-06-Why_it_can_be_rational_to_vote.html">1565 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-06-Why it can be rational to vote</a></p>

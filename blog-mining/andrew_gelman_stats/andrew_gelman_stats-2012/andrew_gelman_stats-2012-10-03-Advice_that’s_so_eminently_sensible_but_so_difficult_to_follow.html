<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there. I offer some of it myself!  As I’ve written before (see  this post from 2008  reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and  this post from 2010  reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
It’s time to play the game again.  This time it’s  advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas  for Ph.D. students.  I’ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum: 
  
  
1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up. 
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride. 
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication.

<p>Introduction: This blog is an exercise in scalability.  Instead of sending a long email to one person, I put the email in a blog where thousands can read it.  Instead of devoting three hours to a referee report that will only be read by two people (the author and the journal editor), I do the equivalent here on the blog.
 
When the American Statistical Association asked me to participate in a workshop to give writing advice for a select group of young researchers, I agreed to participate in this program, as long as the authors were willing to have their articles and my comments posted on the blog.  I think  my advice on writing research articles  had much more effect being posted on the web than it would’ve had, if I’d kept it in that meeting.  (On the other hand, my advice benefited from having those two student papers to push against.  If I’d just tried to give general advice without the context, I don’t think it would’ve been so useful to anyone.)
 
I’ve tried to be scalable for many years before</p><p>4 0.13647407 <a title="1520-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-15-Advice_that_might_make_sense_for_individuals_but_is_negative-sum_overall.html">278 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-15-Advice that might make sense for individuals but is negative-sum overall</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there.  As I  wrote  a couple years ago, it’s usually presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
For example, Nassim Taleb has a  webpage  that includes a bunch of one-line bits of advice (scroll to item 132 on the linked page).  Here’s his final piece of advice:
  
If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.
  
I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.  I’ve been in environments where people follow Taleb’s advice, saying nothing and occasionally trying to “eliminate” people, and it’s not pretty.  I much prefer for people to be open</p><p>5 0.13355076 <a title="1520-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-25-The_problem_with_realistic_advice%3F.html">1428 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-25-The problem with realistic advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>6 0.13059679 <a title="1520-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-30-Works_well_versus_well_understood.html">738 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-30-Works well versus well understood</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reading  this  amusing book review on willpower by Will Self ( link  from Jenny Davidson) reminds me that recently [actually, several months ago; recall that most of this blog is published on a delay], I felt frustrated that I wasn’t getting anything done.  I think that when I write this sort of thing it annoys people, because I’m lucky enough to be in a position to get a lot done—projects ranging from the ethics column to Stan—but I get frustrated when I spend a week trying to work, and then when the week’s over, I realize that all I did was respond to emails, review a bunch of journal submissions and grant proposals, and spend a lot of time staring into space while putting off whatever it was that I really thought I should be doing.
 
I thought and thought, and I decided that my best strategy is what I call  positive procrastination .  Procrastination is of course typically considered a bad thing (or, as ironic-style writers would write, a Bad Thing).  But you can actually use it, ju</p><p>3 0.83719194 <a title="1520-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-The_Three_Golden_Rules_for_Successful_Scientific_Research.html">166 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>4 0.83410907 <a title="1520-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-26-%E2%80%9CDo_you_need_ideal_conditions_to_do_great_work%3F%E2%80%9D.html">592 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-26-“Do you need ideal conditions to do great work?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  links  to a blog by Ben Deaton  arguing  that people often waste time trying to set up ideal working conditions, even though (a) your working conditions will never be ideal, and (b) the sorts of constraints and distractions that one tries to avoid, can often stimulate new ideas.
 
Deaton seems like my kind of guy–for one thing, he  works  on nonlinear finite element analysis, which is one of my longstanding interests–and in many ways his points are reasonable and commonsensical (I have little doubt, for example, that Feynman made a good choice in staying clear of the Institute for Advanced Study!), but I have a couple of points of disagreement.
 
1.  In my experience, working conditions  can  make a difference.  And once you accept this, it could very well make sense to put some effort into improving your work environment.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  quotes  Bentley University economics professor Scott Sumner  writing  on the first anniversary of his blog:
  
Be careful what you wish for.  Last February 2nd I [Sumner] started this blog with very low expectations… I knew I wasn’t a good writer . . . And I was also pretty sure that the content was not of much interest to anyone.


Now my biggest problem is time–I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the blog, seven days a week.  Several hours are spent responding to reader comments and the rest is spent writing long-winded posts and checking other economics blogs. . . .


I [Sumner] don’t think much of the official methodology in macroeconomics.  Many of my fellow economists seem to have a Popperian view of the social sciences.  You develop a model.  You go out and get some data.  And then you try to refute the model with some sort of regression analysis. . . .


My problem with this view is that it doesn’t reflect the way macro and finance actually work.  Instead the models are</p><p>6 0.82430059 <a title="1520-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-14-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">2172 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-14-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.
 
I would like to echo Cairo’</p><p>2 0.97929919 <a title="1520-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-04-Models%2C_assumptions%2C_and_data_summaries.html">1299 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-04-Models, assumptions, and data summaries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw an analysis recently that I didn’t like.  I won’t go into the details, but basically it was a dose-response inference, where a continuous exposure was binned into three broad categories (terciles of the data) and the probability of an adverse event was computed for each tercile.  The effect and the sample size was large enough that the terciles were statistically-significantly different from each other in probability of adverse event, with the probabilities increasing from low to mid to high exposure, as one would predict.
 
I didn’t like this analysis because it is equivalent to fitting a step function.  There is a tendency for people to interpret the (arbitrary) tercile boundaries as being meaningful thresholds even though the underlying dose-response relation has to be continuous.  I’d prefer to start with a linear model and then add nonlinearity from there with a spline or whatever.
 
At this point I stepped back and thought:  Hey, the divide-into-three analysis does not lite</p><p>3 0.97335231 <a title="1520-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-28-Colorless_green%2C_and_clueless.html">168 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-28-Colorless green, and clueless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Faithful readers will know that my ideal alternative career is to be an editor in the Max Perkins mold.  If not that, I think I’d enjoy being a literary essayist, someone like Alfred Kazin or Edmund Wilson or Louis Menand, who could write about my favorite authors and books in a forum where others would read and discuss what I wrote.  I could occasionally collect my articles into books, and so on.  On the other hand, if I actually had such a career, I wouldn’t have much of an option to do statistical research in my spare time, so I think for my own broader goals, I’ve gotten hold of the right side of the stick.
 
As it is, I enjoy writing about literary matters but it never quite seems worth spending the time to do it right.  (And, stepping outside myself, I realize that I have a lot more to offer the world as a statistician than literary critic.  Criticism is like musicianship–it can be hard to do, and it’s impressive when done well, but a lot of people can do it.

<p>Introduction: Cyrus writes:
  
I [Cyrus] was teaching a class on multilevel modeling, and we were playing around with different method to fit a random effects logit model with 2 random intercepts—one corresponding to “family” and another corresponding to “community” (labeled “mom” and “cluster” in the data, respectively).  There are also a few regressors at the individual, family, and community level.  We were replicating in part some of the results from the  following paper :  Improved estimation procedures for multilevel models with binary response: a case-study, by G Rodriguez, N Goldman.


(I say “replicating in part” because we didn’t include all the regressors that they use, only a subset.)  We were looking at the performance of estimation via glmer in R’s lme4 package, glmmPQL in R’s MASS package, and Stata’s xtmelogit.  We wanted to study the performance of various estimation methods, including adaptive quadrature methods and penalized quasi-likelihood.


I was shocked to discover that glmer</p><p>6 0.95222408 <a title="1520-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-25-Looking_for_Sister_Right.html">50 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-25-Looking for Sister Right</a></p>

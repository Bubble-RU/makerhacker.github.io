<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.

<p>Introduction: Steve Cohen writes:
  
My [Cohen's] firm is looking for strong candidates to help us in developing software and analyzing data using Bayesian methods.


We have been developing a suite of programs in C++ which allow us to do Bayesian hierarchical regression and logit/probit models on marketing data. These efforts have included the use of high performance computing tools like nVidia’s CUDA and the new OpenCL standard, which allow parallel processing of Bayesian models. Our software is very, very fast – even on databases that are ½ terabyte in size. The software still needs many additions and improvements and a person with the right skill set will have the chance to make a significant contribution.

<p>Introduction: I’m a physicist by training, statistical data analyst by trade.  Although some of my work is pretty standard statistical analysis, more often I work somewhere in a gray area that includes physics, engineering, and statistics. I have very little formal statistics training but I do study in an academic-like way to learn techniques from the literature when I need to.  I do some things well but there are big gaps in my stats knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in statistics.  On the other hand, there are big gaps in most statisticians’ physics and engineering knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in physics. Generally my breadth and depth of knowledge is about right for the kind of work that I do, I think.

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.
 
The scary part, though, was how the casino company craftily enabled her to</p><p>6 0.73611802 <a title="1596-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-02-%E2%80%9CThe_sky_is_the_limit%E2%80%9D_isn%E2%80%99t_such_a_good_thing.html">835 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-02-“The sky is the limit” isn’t such a good thing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>2 0.94791174 <a title="1596-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-Unfinished_business.html">637 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-Unfinished business</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  blog  by J. Robert Lennon on abandoned novels made me think of the more general topic of abandoned projects.  I seem to recall George V. Higgins writing that he’d written and discarded 14 novels or so before publishing The Friends of Eddie Coyle.
 
I haven’t abandoned any novels but I’ve abandoned lots of research projects (and also have started various projects that there’s no way I’ll finish).  If you think about the decisions involved, it really has to be that way. You learn while you’re working on a project whether it’s worth continuing.  Sometimes I’ve put in the hard work and pushed a project to completion, published the article, and then I think . . . what was the point?  The modal number of citations of our articles is zero, etc.</p><p>3 0.94724005 <a title="1596-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_like_this_cartoon.html">1572 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-10-I don’t like this cartoon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>4 0.94651729 <a title="1596-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-29-Response_to_%E2%80%9CWhy_Tables_Are_Really_Much_Better_Than_Graphs%E2%80%9D.html">736 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-29-Response to “Why Tables Are Really Much Better Than Graphs”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ellen Barnes writes, in response to  my paper and the associated discussion at JCGS ,
  
I [Barnes] am an industry statistician.  I will agree that a table of numbers is essential in an academic publication.  The readers want to be able to sit down with the numbers, and make sure they can replicate the results.  However, graphics communicate faster – especially when a group of engineers are trying to figure out what is going on.  Or, there are times when I have just a couple minutes to convey a complex relationship to a director or a vice-president.


One example from this week:  We are putting a new subsystem into some of our vehicles – using new technology.  The technical specialist leading the project wanted to double check to make sure the system was working properly and finalize the calibration procedure.  He mentioned a concern that was nagging him.  I plotted his data in a matrix plot (a matrix of two dimensional scatter plots).  We immediately keyed in on one plot that showed s</p><p>5 0.94568157 <a title="1596-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist_claims_that_modern_art_could_just_as_well_be_replaced_by_a_%E2%80%9Cpaint-throwing_chimp%E2%80%9D.html">1390 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist claims that modern art could just as well be replaced by a “paint-throwing chimp”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

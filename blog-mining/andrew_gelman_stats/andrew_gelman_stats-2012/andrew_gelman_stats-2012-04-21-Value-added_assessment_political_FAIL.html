<p>Introduction: Jacob Hartog writes the following in reaction to  my post  on the use of value-added modeling for teacher assessment:
  
What I [Hartog] think has been inadequately discussed is the use of individual model specifications to assign these teacher ratings, rather than the zone of agreement across a broad swath of model specifications.


For example, the model used by NYCDOE doesn’t just control for a student’s prior year test score (as I think everyone can agree is a good idea.) It also assumes that different demographic groups will learn different amounts in a given year, and assigns a school-level random effect. The result is that, as was much ballyhooed at the time of the release of the data,the average teacher rating for a given school is roughly the same, no matter whether the school is performing great or terribly. The headline from this was “excellent teachers spread evenly across the city’s schools,” rather than “the specification of these models assume that excellent teachers are</p><p>3 0.16862799 <a title="1274-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-12-%E2%80%9CTeaching_effectiveness%E2%80%9D_as_another_dimension_in_cognitive_ability.html">1620 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-12-“Teaching effectiveness” as another dimension in cognitive ability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m not a great teacher.  I can get by because I work hard and I know a lot, and for some students my classes are just great, but it’s not a natural talent of mine.  I know people who are amazing teachers, and they have something that I just don’t have.  I wrote that book, Teaching Statistics:  A Bag of Tricks (with Deb Nolan) because I’m  not  a good teacher and hence need to develop all sorts of techniques to be able to do what good teachers can do without even trying.
 
I’m not proud of being mediocre at teaching.  I don’t think that low teaching skill is some sort of indicator that I’m a great researcher.  The other think about teaching ability is that I think it’s hard to detect without actually seeing someone teach a class.  If you see me give a seminar presentation or even a guest lecture, you’d think I’m an awesome teacher.  But, actually, no.  I’m an excellent speaker, not such a great teacher.

Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: Stuart Buck writes:
  
I have a question about  fixed effects vs. random effects . Amongst economists who study teacher value-added, it has become common to see people saying that they estimated teacher fixed effects (via least squares dummy variables, so that there is a parameter for each teacher), but that they then applied empirical Bayes shrinkage so that the teacher effects are brought closer to the mean.  (See  this paper  by Jacob and Lefgren, for example.)


Can that really be what they are doing? Why wouldn’t they just run random (modeled) effects in the first place? I feel like there’s something I’m missing.
  
My reply:  I don’t know the full story here, but I’m thinking there are two goals, first to get an unbiased estimate of an overall treatment effect (and there the econometricians prefer so-called fixed effects; I disagree with them on this but I know where they’re coming from) and second to estimate individual teacher effects (and there it makes sense to use so-called</p><p>6 0.13137458 <a title="1274-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-07-Looking_for_a_purpose_in_life%3A__Update_on_that_underworked_and_overpaid_sociologist_whose_%E2%80%9Cmain_task_as_a_university_professor_was_self-cultivation%E2%80%9D.html">750 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-07-Looking for a purpose in life:  Update on that underworked and overpaid sociologist whose “main task as a university professor was self-cultivation”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92587006 <a title="1274-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-21-Value-added_assessment_political_FAIL.html">1274 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-21-Value-added assessment political FAIL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jimmy points me to a  sequence of posts  (Analyzing Released NYC Value-Added Data Parts 1, 2, 3, 4) by Gary Rubinstein slamming value-added assessment of teachers.
 
A skeptical consensus seems to have arisen on this issue.  The teachers groups don’t like the numbers and it seems like none of the reformers trust the numbers enough to defend them.  Lots of people like the  idea  of evaluating teacher performance, but I don’t see anybody out there wanting to seriously defend the numbers that are being pushed out here.
 
P.S.  Just to be clear, I’m specifically addressing the problems arising in value assessment of individual teachers.  I’m not criticizing the interesting research by Jonah Rockoff and others on the distribution of teacher effects.  It’s a lot easier to estimate the distribution of a set of parameters than to estimate the parameters individually.</p><p>3 0.86779785 <a title="1274-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-The_Three_Golden_Rules_for_Successful_Scientific_Research.html">166 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>4 0.82801646 <a title="1274-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-06-Research_Directions_for_Machine_Learning_and_Algorithms.html">747 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-06-Research Directions for Machine Learning and Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading  this  from John Langford:
  
The Deep Learning problem remains interesting. How do you effectively learn complex nonlinearities capable of better performance than a basic linear predictor? An effective solution avoids feature engineering. Right now, this is almost entirely dealt with empirically, but theory could easily have a role to play in phrasing appropriate optimization algorithms, for example.
  
Jimmy asks:
  
Does this sound related to modeling the deep interactions you often talk about?  (I [Jimmy] never understand the stuff on hunch, but thought that might be so?)
  
My reply:  I don’t understand that stuff on hunch so well either–he uses slightly different jargon than I do!  That said, it looks interesting and important so I’m pointing you all to it.</p><p>5 0.82719672 <a title="1274-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-20-Job_opening_at_an_organization_that_promotes_reproducible_research%21.html">1990 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-20-Job opening at an organization that promotes reproducible research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was told about an organization called Reproducibility Initiative.  They tell me they are trying to make what was described in our “50 shades of gray”  post  standard across all of science, particularly areas like cancer research.  I don’t know anything else about them, but that sounds like a good start!

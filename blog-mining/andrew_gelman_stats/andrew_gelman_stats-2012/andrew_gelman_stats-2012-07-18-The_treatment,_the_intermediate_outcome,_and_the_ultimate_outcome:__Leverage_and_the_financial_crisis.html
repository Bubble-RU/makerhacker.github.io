</p><p>5 Here’s just one problem with this story line: It’s not true. [sent-10, score-0.074]
</p><p>6 Look at the historical leverage of the big five investment banks — Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. [sent-12, score-0.853]
</p><p>7 The Government Accountability Office did just this in a July 2009 report and noted that three of the five firms had leverage ratios of 28 to 1 or greater at fiscal year-end 1998, which not only is a lot higher than 12 to 1 but also was higher than their leverage ratios at the end of 2006. [sent-13, score-1.436]
</p><p>8 So if leverage was higher before the rule change than it ever was afterward, how could the 2004 rule change have resulted in previously impermissible leverage? [sent-14, score-1.384]
</p><p>9 ”   A number of prominent academics who were there went on to repeat a version of Woodward’s claim. [sent-21, score-0.161]
</p><p>10 Although Erik Sirri, who was then the director of the SEC’s division of trading and markets, rebutted the claim in 2009, the New York Times didn’t cover it. [sent-31, score-0.094]
</p><p>11 Of the people I cited earlier, only Blinder, Johnson, Kwak and Susan Woodward responded to my calls or emails. [sent-33, score-0.144]
</p><p>12 Blinder now says: “It’s true that very high leverage was a big source of the problem, but the net capital rule does not appear to have changed that much. [sent-34, score-0.86]
</p><p>13 More recently, Andrew Lo, the director of MIT’s Laboratory for Financial Engineering, wrote a paper analyzing 21 books on the financial crisis. [sent-38, score-0.287]
</p><p>14 In his paper, he pointed out the fallacy of blaming increased leverage on the 2004 rule change. [sent-39, score-0.784]
</p><p>15 Although Lo’s paper was picked up by the Economist, even that didn’t spur any of the academics who made the mistake to correct it. [sent-40, score-0.21]
</p><p>16 I know nothing about the substance here; setting that aside, this story interests me for two reasons. [sent-44, score-0.074]
</p><p>17 First, as Gur writes, it’s a story of “a posterior formed from a prior without letting the facts get in the way” and as such related to our discussions about communication difficulties and confirmation bias. [sent-45, score-0.074]
</p><p>18 Second, from a formal causal inference perspective, it’s a story of an “instrument” or treatment (a change in the leverage rule), followed by an “mediator” or intermediate outcome (the actual changes in leverage) and then an ultimate outcome (the financial crash). [sent-46, score-1.15]
</p><p>19 The claim is that the initial treatment had no effect because there was no change in the mediator. [sent-47, score-0.221]
</p><p>20 There would seem to be other possibilities (for example, perhaps the rule change, which allow the possibility of actual changes, was enough to motivate various dangerous outcomes), but I don’t know enough about the context to say anything more. [sent-48, score-0.25]

<p>Introduction: Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson  write :
  
Financial crises are staggeringly costly. Only major wars rival them in the burdens they place on public finances. Taxpayers typically transfer enormous resources to banks, their stockholders, and creditors, while public debt explodes and the economy runs below full employment for years. This paper compares how relatively large, developed countries have handled bailouts over time. It analyzes why some have done better than others at containing costs and protecting taxpayers. The paper argues that political variables – the nature of competition within party systems and voting turnout – help explain why some countries do more than others to limit the moral hazards of bailouts.
  
I know next to nothing about this topic, so I’ll just recommend you click through and read the article yourself.  Here’s a bit more:

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I love  this post by Jialan Wang.  Wang “downloaded quarterly accounting data for all firms in Compustat, the most widely-used dataset in corporate finance that contains data on over 20,000 firms from SEC filings” and looked at the statistical distribution of leading digits in various pieces of financial information. As expected, the distribution is very close to what is predicted by  Benford’s Law .
 
Very close, but not identical. But does that mean anything? Benford’s “Law” isn’t really a law, it’s more of a rule or principle: it’s certainly possible for the distribution of leading digits in financial data — even a massive corpus of it — to deviate from the rule without this indicating massive fraud or error. But, aha, Wang also looks at how the deviation from Benford’s Law has changed with time, and looks at it by industry, and this is where things get really interesting and suggestive. I really can’t summarize any better than Wang did, so click on the first</p><p>4 0.099501267 <a title="1420-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-22-Ticket_to_Baaaaarf.html">2301 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-22-Ticket to Baaaaarf</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A link from the comments here took me to the wonderfully named  Barfblog  and a report by Don Schaffner on some reporting.
 
 First, the background:   A university in England issued a press release saying that “Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria than if it is left for longer periods of time . . . The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the ‘5 second rule’  – the urban myth about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped.”  According to the press release, the study was “undertaken by final year Biology students” and led by a professor of microbiology.
 
The press release hit the big time, hitting NPR, Slate, Forbes, the Daily News, etc etc.  Some typical headlines:
 
“5-second rule backed up by science” — Atlanta Journal Constitution

<p>Introduction: I happened to receive two questions about stopping rules on the same day.
 
First, from Tom Cunningham:
  
I’ve been arguing with my colleagues about whether the stopping rule is relevant (a presenter disclosed that he went out to collect more data because the first experiment didn’t get significant results) — and I believe you have some qualifications to the Bayesian irrelevance argument but I don’t properly understand them.
  
Then, from Benjamin Kay:
  
I have a question that may be of interest for your blog. I was reading about the early history of AIDS and learned that the the trial of AZT was ended early because it was  so effective :

 
The trial reported in the New England Journal of medicine, had produced a dramatic result. Before the planned 24 week duration of the study, after a mean period of participation of about 120 days, nineteen participants receiving placebo had died while there was only a single death among those receiving AZT.   This appeared to be a momentous break</p><p>6 0.096372955 <a title="1420-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Demographics%3A_what_variable_best_predicts_a_financial_crisis%3F.html">149 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Demographics: what variable best predicts a financial crisis?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

<p>Introduction: Daniel Mendelsohn recently  asked , “Why do we love the Titanic?”, seeking to understand how it has happened that: 
  
  
It may not be true that ‘the three most written-about subjects of all time are Jesus, the Civil War, and the Titanic,’ as one historian has put it, but it’s not much of an exaggeration. . . . The inexhaustible interest suggests that the Titanic’s story taps a vein much deeper than the morbid fascination that has attached to other disasters. The explosion of the Hindenburg, for instance, and even the torpedoing, just three years after the Titanic sank, of the Lusitania, another great liner whose passenger list boasted the rich and the famous, were calamities that shocked the world but have failed to generate an obsessive preoccupation. . . . 


If the Titanic has gripped our imagination so forcefully for the past century, it must be because of something bigger than any fact of social or political or cultural history.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor points me to an  opinion piece  by psychologist Reid Hastie, “Our Gift for Good Stories Blinds Us to the Truth.”
 
I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93875766 <a title="1420-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-18-The_treatment%2C_the_intermediate_outcome%2C_and_the_ultimate_outcome%3A__Leverage_and_the_financial_crisis.html">1420 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-18-The treatment, the intermediate outcome, and the ultimate outcome:  Leverage and the financial crisis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Huberman points to an article on the financial crisis by Bethany McLean, who  writes :
  
lthough our understanding of what instigated the 2008 global financial crisis remains at best incomplete, there are a few widely agreed upon contributing factors. One of them is a 2004 rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allowed investment banks to load up on leverage.


This disastrous decision has been cited by a host of prominent economists, including Princeton professor and former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Alan Blinder and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. It has even been immortalized in Hollywood, figuring into the dark financial narrative that propelled the Academy Award-winning film Inside Job. . . .


Here’s just one problem with this story line: It’s not true. Nor is it hard to prove that. Look at the historical leverage of the big five investment banks — Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.

<p>Introduction: Tools worth knowing about: 
  
  Google Refine  is a power tool for working with messy data, cleaning it up, transforming it from one format into another, extending it with web services, and linking it to databases like Freebase.
  
A recent  discussion on the Polmeth list  about the  ANES Cumulative File  is a setting where I think Refine might help (admittedly 49760×951 is bigger than I’d really like to deal with in the browser with js… but on a subset yes). [I might write this example up later.]
 
Go watch the screencast videos for Refine. Data-entry problems are rampant in stuff we all use — leading or trailing spaces; mixed decimal-indicators; different units or transformations used in the same column; mixed lettercase leading to false duplicates; that’s only the beginning. Refine certainly would help find duplicates, and it counts things for you too. Just counting rows is too much for researchers sometimes (see  yesterday’s post )!

<p>Introduction: In our recent thread on computing hierarchical models with big datasets, someone  brought up  Blup.  I thought it might be worth explaining what Blup is and how it relates to hierarchical models.
 
Blup stands for Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, but in my terminology it’s just hierarchical modeling.  Let me break it down: 
- “Best” doesn’t really matter.  What’s important is that our estimates and predictions make sense and are as accurate as possible. 
- “Linear” isn’t so important.  Statistical predictions are linear for Gaussian linear models, otherwise not.  We can and do perform hierarchical generalized linear models all the time. 
- “Unbiased” doesn’t really matter (see discussion of “Best,” above). 
- “Prediction” is the key word for relating Blup and hierarchical modeling to classical statistical terminology.  In classical statistics, “estimation” of a parameter theta is evaluated conditional on the true value of theta, whereas “prediction” of a predictive quantity phi is eval</p><p>6 0.87342745 <a title="1420-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Meritocracy_rerun.html">1937 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Meritocracy rerun</a></p>

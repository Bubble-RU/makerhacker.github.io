</p><p>6 The second thing that they provide is legitimacy . [sent-15, score-0.155]
</p><p>7 you hire the consultants to confirm what you already thought. [sent-18, score-0.406]

</p><p>11 I’ve done some consulting of the “operational” sort, where I provide advice so that people can better solve their problems. [sent-30, score-0.674]
</p><p>12 Other times I’ve been paid to give a short course on Bayesian statistics or multilevel modeling (I’ve done that at Procter & Gamble, Merck, and Google), and I hope it will be useful to the people there, but I really have no idea. [sent-31, score-0.569]
</p><p>13 Still other times I’ve been paid to do really easy stuff—I’m thinking here of some legal consulting involving simple random sampling of documents from files. [sent-32, score-0.806]

<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>3 0.1969218 <a title="1597-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-Consulting%3A_how_do_you_figure_out_what_to_charge%3F.html">395 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-Consulting: how do you figure out what to charge?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a physicist by training, statistical data analyst by trade.  Although some of my work is pretty standard statistical analysis, more often I work somewhere in a gray area that includes physics, engineering, and statistics. I have very little formal statistics training but I do study in an academic-like way to learn techniques from the literature when I need to.  I do some things well but there are big gaps in my stats knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in statistics.  On the other hand, there are big gaps in most statisticians’ physics and engineering knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in physics. Generally my breadth and depth of knowledge is about right for the kind of work that I do, I think. 
 
But last week I was offered a consulting job that might be better done by someone with more conventional stats knowledge than I have.  The job involves gene expression in different types of tumors, so it’s “biostatistics” by definition, but the</p><p>4 0.12243895 <a title="1597-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-%24.html">1003 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.

<p>Introduction: Steve Cohen writes:
  
My [Cohen's] firm is looking for strong candidates to help us in developing software and analyzing data using Bayesian methods.


We have been developing a suite of programs in C++ which allow us to do Bayesian hierarchical regression and logit/probit models on marketing data. These efforts have included the use of high performance computing tools like nVidia’s CUDA and the new OpenCL standard, which allow parallel processing of Bayesian models. Our software is very, very fast – even on databases that are ½ terabyte in size. The software still needs many additions and improvements and a person with the right skill set will have the chance to make a significant contribution.

<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.

I’ve long been glad that when I went to college in the 80s, I was at MIT rather than Harvard. Either place I would’ve taken hard classes and learned a lot, but one advantage of MIT was that we had no sense–no sense at all–that we could make big bucks. We had no sense of making moderately big bucks as lawyers, no sense of making big bucks working on Wall Street, and no sense of making really big bucks by starting a business. I mean, sure, we knew about lawyers (but we didn’t know that a lawyer with technical skills would be a killer combination), we knew about Wall Street (but we had no idea what they did, other than shout pork belly prices across a big room), and we knew about tech startups (but we had no idea that they were anything to us beyond a source of jobs for engineers). What we were all looking for was a good solid job with cool benefits (like those companies in California that had gy</p><p>6 0.81475031 <a title="1597-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-More_consulting_experiences%2C_this_time_in_computational_linguistics.html">1596 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-More consulting experiences, this time in computational linguistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.
  
Perhaps unsurprisingly given my Bayesian attitudes and my preference for  continuity , I’m inclined to split the d</p><p>2 0.95184302 <a title="1597-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Proposal_for_a_moratorium_on_the_use_of_the_words_%E2%80%9Cfashionable%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Ctrendy%E2%80%9D.html">189 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Proposal for a moratorium on the use of the words “fashionable” and “trendy”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>3 0.94360298 <a title="1597-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">1119 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association is seeking nominations for its annual  Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award .  The award was created in 2004 to encourage and recognize members of the communications media who have best displayed an informed interest in the science of statistics and its role in public life. The award can be given for a single statistical article or for a body of work.
 
Former winners of the award include:  Felix Salmon , financial blogger, 2010;  Sharon Begley , Newsweek, 2009; Mark Buchanan, New York Times, 2008; John Berry, Bloomberg News, 2005; and Gina Kolata, New York Times, 2004.
 
If anyone has any suggestions for the 2012 award, feel free to post in the comments or email me.</p><p>4 0.94190168 <a title="1597-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.


Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users can learn and p</p><p>5 0.93833977 <a title="1597-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-27-A_use_for_tables_%28really%29.html">372 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-27-A use for tables (really)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>6 0.93225658 <a title="1597-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-24-My_NOAA_story.html">677 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-24-My NOAA story</a></p>

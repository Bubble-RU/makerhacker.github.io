</p><p>2 Carolina, Virginia, California, Florida, etc—warm states = more opportunity to practice the technical nature of the jumps (10,000 rule? [sent-5, score-0.18]
</p><p>3 I’ve collected the information as to what it takes to become an All American (distances) and how tall on average these jumpers were and what their personal bests were coming out of high school. [sent-7, score-0.71]
</p><p>4 For example, a future All American might look like this in the men’s long jump:  High school best of 24’1″, 6’1″ in height, and he’s got a 67% chance of coming from the states listed above. [sent-8, score-0.35]
</p><p>5 However, when looking at the Top 10 rankings over the last 13 years, only 12 of those jumpers became All Americans. [sent-9, score-0.684]
</p><p>6 Jumping over 24′ is the average of those who became All American, but it certainly doesn’t guarantee your success! [sent-10, score-0.077]
</p><p>7 After reading Silver’s book and learning of Bayes’ Theorem, (as I’ve seen you discuss it in your blog and in a review of Taleb’s Fooled by Randomness), I started pondering if there were a way for me to make a rudimentary predictive model of high school recruits (long and triple jumpers). [sent-11, score-0.457]
</p><p>8 I could do what Kahneman prescribed for hiring an employee (pick six attributes and score them up, and always take the person with the highest score—removing any potential bias). [sent-12, score-0.262]
</p><p>9 I’ve thought of those traits as potentially: Best three jumps, performance at the state championship, speed, test score or GPA, height (not always easy to find), etc). [sent-13, score-0.289]
</p><p>10 There are several biases coaches fall victim to in recruiting (judgments based on intuition indeed:  going to watch an athlete perform in practice or a competition—a year I HAVE to sign a good jumper, let’s say, and we “think” he’s going to be good. [sent-14, score-0.597]
</p><p>11 not based on fact but based on our faulty intuition because we NEED him to be good and he’s interested in our program). [sent-16, score-0.403]
</p><p>12 Also, we get calls from coaches who claim their athlete is going to be good, or has high potential. [sent-17, score-0.392]
</p><p>13 I’ve collected over 350 of the best jumps from the 2007 high school class (among tons of other data) to see without hindsight bias (not throwing anything out—Julio Jones plays for the Atlanta Falcons, Jeremy Kerley for the Jets—but keeping them in any potential rankings I devise). [sent-18, score-0.812]
</p><p>14 So now I’m getting to my question you can already see:  Do you think there’s a way using a regression model or Bayes’ Theorem, or any direct or indirect correlations (Bill James is a hero of mine :)) that I could come up with something to weed out one jump wonders or find diamonds in rough?

</p><p>16 faulty intuition sabotaged by some sort of bias, we will be better served. [sent-21, score-0.329]

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>3 0.12269197 <a title="1625-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-21-Two_reviews_of_Nate_Silver%E2%80%99s_new_book%2C_from_Kaiser_Fung_and_Cathy_O%E2%80%99Neil.html">1634 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-21-Two reviews of Nate Silver’s new book, from Kaiser Fung and Cathy O’Neil</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People keep asking me what I think of Nate’s book, and I keep replying that, as a blogger, I’m spoiled.  I’m so used to getting books for free that I wouldn’t go out and buy a book just for the purpose of reviewing it.  (That reminds me that I should post reviews of some of those books I’ve received in the mail over the past few months.)
 
I have, however, encountered a couple of reviews of The Signal and the Noise so I thought I’d pass them on to you.  Both these reviews are by statisticians / data scientists who work here in NYC in the non-academic “real world” so in that sense they are perhaps better situated than me to review the book (also, they have not collaborated with Nate so they have no conflict of interest).
 
Kaiser Fung gives a  positive review :
  
It is in the subtitle—“why so many predictions fail – but some don’t”—that one learns the core philosophy of Silver: he is most concerned with the honest evaluation of the performance of predictive models.

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.091485634 <a title="1625-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-SAT_stories.html">94 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-SAT stories</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>3 0.73850936 <a title="1625-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>4 0.73686266 <a title="1625-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>5 0.73679602 <a title="1625-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-20-Fooled_by_randomness.html">2297 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-20-Fooled by randomness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

<p>Introduction: Marc Tanguay writes in with a specific question that has a very general answer.  First, the question:
  
I [Tanguay] am currently running a MCMC for which I have 3 parameters that are restricted to a specific space. 2 are bounded between 0 and 1 while the third is binary and updated by a Beta-Binomial. Since my priors are also bounded, I notice that, conditional on All the rest (which covers both data and other parameters), the density was not varying a lot within the space of the parameters. As a result, the acceptance rate is high, about 85%, and this despite the fact that all the parameter’s space is explore. Since in your book, the optimal acceptance rates prescribed are lower that 50% (in case of multiple parameters), do you think I should worry about getting 85%.  Or is this normal given the restrictions on the parameters?
  
First off:  Yes, my guess is that you should be taking bigger jumps.  85% seems like too high an acceptance rate for Metropolis jumping.

<p>Introduction: I’m just glad that universities don’t  sanction  professors for publishing false theorems.
 
If the guy really is nailed by the feds for fraud, I hope they don’t throw him in prison.  In general, prison time seems like a brutal, expensive, and inefficient way to punish people.  I’d prefer if the government just took 95% of his salary for several years, made him do community service (cleaning equipment at the local sewage treatment plant, perhaps; a lab scientist should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc.  If restriction of this dude’s personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, he could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if he were ever more than 3 miles from his home.  But no need to bill the taxpayers for the cost of keeping him in prison.</p><p>3 0.94629443 <a title="1625-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-19-%E2%80%9CBehind_a_cancer-treatment_firm%E2%80%99s_rosy_survival_claims%E2%80%9D.html">1906 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-19-“Behind a cancer-treatment firm’s rosy survival claims”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally. And 64 percent of its prostate cancer patients are alive at three years, vers</p><p>4 0.94486022 <a title="1625-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-06-The_new_Stan_1.1.1%2C_featuring_Gaussian_processes%21.html">1710 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-06-The new Stan 1.1.1, featuring Gaussian processes!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released Stan 1.1.1 and RStan 1.1.1
 
As usual, you can find download and install instructions at:
 
http://mc-stan.org/
 
This is a patch release and is fully backward compatible with Stan and RStan 1.1.0.  The main thing you should notice is that the multivariate models should be much faster and all the bugs reported for 1.1.0 have been fixed.  We’ve also added a bit more functionality.  The substantial changes are listed in the following release notes. 
   
v1.1.1 (5 February 2012) 
======================================================================
 
Bug Fixes 
———————————- 
* fixed bug in comparison operators, which swapped operator< with operator<= and swapped operator> with operator>= semantics 
* auto-initialize all variables to prevent segfaults 
* atan2 gradient propagation fixed 
* fixed off-by-one in NUTS treedepth bound so NUTS goes at most to specified tree depth rather than specified depth + 1 
* various compiler compatibility and minor consistency issues 
* f</p><p>5 0.92681652 <a title="1625-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-03-Kuhn%2C_1-f_noise%2C_and_the_fractal_nature_of_scientific_revolutions.html">1924 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-03-Kuhn, 1-f noise, and the fractal nature of scientific revolutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
I was re-reading your and Shalizi’s  “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics”  [see also the  rejoinder ] and noticed a statement near the end of section 6 about paradigm shifts coming in different magnitudes over different time spans.  That reminded me of the almost-mystical ideas surrounding 1/f (f being frequency”) noise in some areas — the notion that almost everything exhibits that effect, and that effect extends to arbitrarily low f.  (I sense the idea only gets mystical when f gets low enough so that the event that may happen stochastically is really big—say, you model the height of waves in the Atlantic as 1/f and discover that, at some low frequency, Bermuda becomes submerged.  In other words, does the same mechanism that accounts for physical vibrations in the range of Hertz also account for the creation and destruction of islands that may occur in the range of reciprocal centuries?)

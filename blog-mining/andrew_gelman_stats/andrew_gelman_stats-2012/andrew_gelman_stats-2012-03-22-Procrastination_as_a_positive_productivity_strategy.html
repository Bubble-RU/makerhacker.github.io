<p>Introduction: In a further  discussion  of the discussion about the discussion of a paper in Administrative Science Quarterly, Thomas Basbøll writes:
  
I [Basbøll] feel “entitled”, if that’s the right word (actually, I’d say I feel privileged), to express my opinions to anyone who wants to listen, and while I think it does say something about an author whether or not they answer a question (where what it says depends very much on the quality of the question), I don’t think the author has any obligation to me to respond immediately. If I succeed in raising doubts about something in the minds of many readers, then that’s obviously something an author should take seriously. The point is that an author has a responsibility to the readership of the paper, not any one critic.
  
I agree that the ultimate audience is the scholarly community (and, beyond that, the general public) and that the critic is just serving as a conduit, the person who poses the Q in the Q-and-A.

<p>Introduction: I studied math and physics at MIT. To be more precise, I started in math as default–ever since I was two years old, I’ve thought of myself as a mathematician, and I always did well in math class, so it seemed like a natural fit.
 
But I was concerned. In high school I’d been in the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad training program, and there I’d met kids who were clearly much much better at math than I was. In retrospect, I don’t think I was as bad as I’d thought at the time: there were 24 kids in the program, and I was probably around #20, if that, but I think a lot of the other kids had more practice working on “math olympiad”-type problems. Maybe I was really something like the tenth-best in the group.
 
Tenth-best or twentieth-best, whatever it was, I reached a crisis of confidence around my sophomore or junior year in college. At MIT, I started right off taking advanced math classes, and somewhere along the way I realized I wasn’t seeing the big picture. I was able to do the homework pr</p><p>4 0.10947597 <a title="1225-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-09-Advice%3A__positive-sum%2C_zero-sum%2C_or_negative-sum.html">2287 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-09-Advice:  positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there. I offer some of it myself!  As I’ve written before (see  this post from 2008  reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and  this post from 2010  reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
It’s time to play the game again.  This time it’s  advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas  for Ph.D. students.  I’ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum: 
  
  
1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up. 
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride. 
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication. Don’t h</p><p>5 0.10060076 <a title="1225-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.  The second paper, in particular, took some effort to place; I got some advice from colleagues in sociology as to where</p><p>6 0.096951716 <a title="1225-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning_to_Stan.html">2291 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning to Stan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>3 0.85974801 <a title="1225-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-23-My_new_writing_strategy.html">727 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-23-My new writing strategy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In high school and college I would write long assignments using a series of outlines.  I’d start with a single sheet where I’d write down the key phrases, connect them with lines, and then write more and more phrases until the page was filled up.  Then I’d write a series of outlines, culminating in a sentence-level outline that was roughly one line per sentence of the paper.  Then I’d write.  It worked pretty well.  Or horribly, depending on how you look at it.  I was able to produce 10-page papers etc. on time.  But I think it crippled my writing style for years.  It’s taken me a long time to learn how to write directly–to explain clearly what I’ve done and why.  And I’m still working on the “why” part.  There’s a thin line between verbosity and terseness.
 
I went to MIT and my roommate was a computer science major.  He wrote me a word processor on his Atari 800, which did the job pretty well.  For my senior thesis I broke down and used the computers in campus.  I formatted it in tro</p><p>4 0.85021299 <a title="1225-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-29-A_Ph.D._thesis_is_not_really_a_marathon.html">1351 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-29-A Ph.D. thesis is not really a marathon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

They are both endurance events, they last a long time and they require a consistent and carefully calculated amount of effor</p><p>5 0.84188426 <a title="1225-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-14-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">2172 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-14-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  a few years ago :
  
 General advice 


Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend rewriting both articles from scratch, using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.

<p>Introduction: I know next to nothing about golf.  My mini-golf scores typically approach the maximum of 7 per hole, and I’ve never actually played macro-golf.  I did publish a paper on golf once ( A Probability Model for Golf Putting , with Deb Nolan), but it’s not so rare for people to publish papers on topics they know nothing about.  Those who can’t, research.
 
But I certainly have the ability to post other people’s ideas.  Charles Murray writes:
  
I [Murray] am playing around with the likelihood of Tiger Woods breaking Nicklaus’s record in the Majors. I’ve already gone on record  two years ago  with the reason why he won’t, but now I’m looking at it from a non-psychological perspective. Given the history of the majors, what how far above the average _for other great golfers_ does Tiger have to perform?


Here’s the procedure I’ve been working on:

<p>Introduction: Reading  this  amusing book review on willpower by Will Self ( link  from Jenny Davidson) reminds me that recently [actually, several months ago; recall that most of this blog is published on a delay], I felt frustrated that I wasn’t getting anything done.  I think that when I write this sort of thing it annoys people, because I’m lucky enough to be in a position to get a lot done—projects ranging from the ethics column to Stan—but I get frustrated when I spend a week trying to work, and then when the week’s over, I realize that all I did was respond to emails, review a bunch of journal submissions and grant proposals, and spend a lot of time staring into space while putting off whatever it was that I really thought I should be doing.
 
I thought and thought, and I decided that my best strategy is what I call  positive procrastination .  Procrastination is of course typically considered a bad thing (or, as ironic-style writers would write, a Bad Thing).  But you can actually use it, ju</p><p>3 0.9648881 <a title="1225-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-12-Stan_1.3.0_and_RStan_1.3.0_Ready_for_Action.html">1799 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-12-Stan 1.3.0 and RStan 1.3.0 Ready for Action</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve had a couple of email conversations in the past couple days on dependence in multivariate prior distributions.
 
 Modeling the degrees of freedom and scale parameters in the t distribution 
 
First, in our Stan group we’ve been discussing the choice of priors for the degrees-of-freedom parameter in the t distribution.  I wrote that also there’s the question of parameterization.  It does not necessarily make sense to have independent priors on the df and scale parameters.  In some sense, the meaning of the scale parameter changes with the df.
 
 Prior dependence between correlation and scale parameters in the scaled inverse-Wishart model 
 
The second case of parameterization in prior distribution arose from an email I received from Chris Chatham pointing me to  this exploration  by Matt Simpson of the scaled inverse-Wishart prior distribution for hierarchical covariance matrices.  Simpson writes:
  
A popular prior for Σ is the inverse-Wishart distribution [ not  the same as the</p><p>5 0.95856726 <a title="1225-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-21-D._Buggin.html">1465 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-21-D. Buggin</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Zhao writes:
  
I am trying to fit my data using the scaled inverse wishart model you mentioned in your book, Data analysis using regression and hierarchical models. Instead of using a uniform prior on the scale parameters, I try to use a log-normal distribution prior. However, I found that the individual coefficients don’t shrink much to a certain value even a highly informative prior (with extremely low variance) is considered. The coefficients are just very close to their least-squares estimations. Is it because of the log-normal prior I’m using or I’m wrong somewhere?
  
My reply:  If your priors are concentrated enough at zero variance, then yeah, the posterior estimates of the parameters should be pulled (almost) all the way to zero.  If this isn’t happening, you got a problem.  So as a start I’d try putting in some really strong priors concentrated at 0 (for example, N(0,.1^2)) and checking that you get a sensible answer.  If not, you might well have a bug.

<p>Introduction: A journalist asked me for my thoughts on academics and blogging, in light of the  recently announced  move of the sister blog to the Washington Post.  I responded as follows: 
  
  
John Sides is the leader of the Monkey Cage and in particular was the key person involved in the Washington Post move.


But I will give you some general comments based on my own experiences.


I started blogging in 2004:  Samantha Cook (my postdoc at the time) and I set up the blog so that we could communicate our partially-formed research ideas to each other, in a way that would be open to the world so that (a) we could get input from interested outsiders, and (b) we could publicize our work.  We decided to post daily (or approximately thus).  At the time, I figured that if there was ever a time that we ran out of material, I could post summaries of my old research papers.


The blog quickly became a place for us to give our various thoughts on statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science.</p><p>3 0.30032599 <a title="1129-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-04-Recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">2088 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-04-Recently in the sister blog</a></p>

I have mixed feelings about the move of the Monkey Cage blog to the Washington Post.  I’ve been told we get many more readers, but the the comments have declined in number and in quality.  It used to be that posting at the Monkey Cage felt like “blogging”:  I’d post something there and look at the comments.  It was a political science community with many participants from outside the field.  Posting at the new blog is more like writing for the newspaper:  it’s a broadcast without real feedback.

<p>Introduction: Following up on our recent  discussion  of combative linguist Noam Chomsky and disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser, here are  some stories  from Jay Livingston about monkey research.
 
Don’t get me wrong—I eat burgers, so I’m not trying to get on my moral high horse here.  But the stories do get you thinking about measurement error and why I would  not  trust the PI of a monkey study to code his own measurements and keep his data secret.</p><p>6 0.1386634 <a title="1129-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-05-What_predicts_whether_a_school_district_will_participate_in_a_large-scale_evaluation%3F.html">2125 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-05-What predicts whether a school district will participate in a large-scale evaluation?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dear Reuters editor:
 
Thanks for reading  my blog  and correcting the erroneous numbers in Easterbrook’s  column  from the other day.
 
I’m pretty sure you got the corrections from my blog because in your corrections you used  the exact same links  that I posted.  I think your readers will like that you gave links to the sources of your numbers.
 
But I’d appreciate if you cite me!  It’s considered polite to credit your sources rather than just copying over numbers and links with no mention of where they came from.  Unlike Easterbrook, I’m not expecting to be paid for this material but I’d still like to be thanked.
 
(See the last paragraph of  this post  by Felix Salmon for more on the desirability of linking to your sources.)
 
Also, since you’re correcting the article anyway, maybe you could go back and change this sentence too:
  
But don’t sell Huntsman short because he is low in the polls – Obama had been at that point, too.

<p>Introduction: I don’t know when I’ve seen political writing quote so misinformed as this. It’s a bizarre mixture of cliches, non-sequitors, and outright mistakes.
 
The author is Gregg Easterbrook and he’s writing for  Reuters .
 
First, the cliches:
  
Right now Romney seems to be the frontrunner, which, of course, is a mixed blessing. His aura of experience and reasonableness could prove quite appealing to voters. Perry continues to have the potential to light a populist fire. . . . Of all the 2012 candidates, Huntsman is the one who is Not Just Another Politician.
  
And now the errors.
  
At this point in the 1992 election cycle, the elder George Bush held an 89 percent approval rating. . . . Clinton beat a popular incumbent with a fantastic approval rating. For the 2012 election, Barack Obama is just as vulnerable as the elder Bush, if not even more so. Obama currently has an approval rating of 23 percent.
  
This is all fine, except that:

It’s not true that at this point in the 1992 elec</p><p>5 0.57699758 <a title="1129-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-24-In_case_you_were_wondering%2C_here%E2%80%99s_the_price_of_milk.html">588 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-24-In case you were wondering, here’s the price of milk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seeing Sarah Palin’s recent  witticism :
  
It’s no wonder Michelle Obama is telling everybody you need to breast feed your babies … the price of milk is so high!
  
I was reminded of Dan Quayle’s quip during the 1988 campaign:
  
The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber ducky drowned in the bathtub.
  
And this got me wondering:  how often do legitimate political figures–not talk show hosts, but actual politicians–communicate via schoolyard-style taunts?
  

 
I’m not talking here about dry wit of the Bob Dole or Morris Udall variety, or political gamesmanship such as Ronald Reagan’s “make my day,” or flat-out partisanship like Alan Grayson’s “the Republicans want you to die quickly” or James Watt’s line about “liberals and Americans.”  It’s gotta be an actual joke.
 
There must be some other examples of Palin/Quayle style humor, but I’m not sure where to look.
 
I keep thinking of Veronica Geng’s hilarious story which includes the line:

<p>Introduction: Best blog comment  ever , following up on our post, How tall is Jon Lee Anderson?:
  
Based on this picture: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/1640569735_05337bb974.jpg he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on this picture: http://www.catalinagarcia.com/cata/Libraries/BLOG_Images/Cata_w_Jon_Lee_Anderson.sflb.ashx he appears to be about 9-10 inches taller than Catalina Garcia.


But how tall is Catalina Garcia? Not that tall – she’s shorter than the high-wire artist Phillipe Petit http://www.catalinagarcia.com/cata/Libraries/BLOG_Images/Cata_w_Philippe_Petite.sflb.ashx. And he doesn’t appear to be that tall… about the same height as Claire Danes: http://cdn.theatermania.com/photo-gallery/Petit_Danes_Daldry_2421_4700.jpg – who according to Google is 5′ 6″.


So if Jon Lee Anderson is 10″ taller than Catalina Garcia, who is 2″ shorter than Philippe Petit, who is the same height as Claire Danes, then he is 6′ 2″ tall.

<p>Introduction: From Wikipedia (via  Jay Livingston ):
  
Newsweek sells only about 40,000 newsstand copies compared with 1.5 million subscriptions.  (Both figures are substantially lower than they were a decade ago.)  The figures for Time are about double those of Newsweek, but the ratio of newsstand sales to subscriptions is about the same.
  
I guess I’m not surprised that most of the sales are from subscriptions, but I’m surprised the fraction is so close to 100%.</p><p>4 0.86133409 <a title="1129-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-13-%E2%80%9CI_have_no_idea_who_Catalina_Garcia_is%2C_but_she_makes_a_decent_ruler%E2%80%9D%3A__I_don%E2%80%99t_know_if_John_Lee_%E2%80%9Clittle_twerp%E2%80%9D_Anderson_actually_suffers_from_tall-person_syndrome%2C_but_he_is_indeed_tall.html">1762 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-13-“I have no idea who Catalina Garcia is, but she makes a decent ruler”:  I don’t know if John Lee “little twerp” Anderson actually suffers from tall-person syndrome, but he is indeed tall</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just want to share with you the best comment we’ve every had in the nearly ten-year history of this blog.  Also it has statistical content!
 
Here’s the story.  After seeing an amusing  article  by Tom Scocca relating how reporter John Lee Anderson called someone as a “little twerp” on twitter:
 
 
 
I  conjectured  that Anderson suffered from “tall person syndrome,” that problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.
 
But I had no idea of Anderson’s actual height.  Commenter Gary  responded  with this impressive bit of investigative reporting:
  
Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be about 9-10 inches taller than Catalina Garcia.

<p>Introduction: This  (forwarded to me from Jeff, from a powerpoint by Willam Gawthrop) wins not on form but on content:
 
   
 
Really this graph should stand alone but it’s so wonderful that I can’t resist pointing out a few things: 
   
- The gap between 610 and 622 A.D. seems to be about the same as the previous 600 years, and only a little less than the 1400 years before that.
 
- “Pious and devout” Jews are portrayed as having steadily increased in nonviolence up to the present day.  Been to Israel lately?
 
- I assume the line labeled “Bible” is referring to Christians?  I’m sort of amazed to see pious and devout Christians listed as being maximally violent at the beginning.  Huh?  I thought Christ was supposed to be a nonviolent, mellow dude.  The line starts at 3 B.C., implying that  baby Jesus  was at the extreme of violence.
 
Gong forward, we can learn from the graph that pious and devout Christians in 1492 or 1618, say, were much more peaceful than Jesus and his crew.

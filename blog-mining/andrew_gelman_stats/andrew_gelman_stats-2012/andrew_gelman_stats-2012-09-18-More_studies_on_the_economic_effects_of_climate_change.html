Severe Weather and Automobile Assembly Productivity

Abstract: It is expected that climate change could lead to an increased frequency of severe weather. In turn, severe weather intuitively should hamper the productivity of work that occurs outside. But what is the effect of rain, snow, fog, heat and wind on work that occurs indoors, such as the production of automobiles? Using weekly production data from 64 automobile plants in the United States over a ten-year period, we ﬁnd that adverse weather conditions lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in production.

<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).

<p>Introduction: I hate to keep bumping our scheduled posts but this is just too important and too exciting to wait.  So it’s time to jump the queue.
 
 
 
The news is  a paper from Michael Betancourt  that presents a super-cool new way to compute normalizing constants:
  
A common strategy for inference in complex models is the relaxation of a simple model into the more complex target model, for example the prior into the posterior in Bayesian inference. Existing approaches that attempt to generate such transformations, however, are sensitive to the pathologies of complex distributions and can be difficult to implement in practice. Leveraging the geometry of thermodynamic processes I introduce a principled and robust approach to deforming measures that presents a powerful new tool for inference.
  
The idea is to generalize Hamiltonian Monte Carlo so that it moves through a family of distributions (that is, it transitions through an “inverse temperature” variable called beta that indexes the family) a</p><p>4 0.25314406 <a title="1501-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-17-%E2%80%9C2%25_per_degree_Celsius_._._._the_magic_number_for_how_worker_productivity_responds_to_warm-hot_temperatures%E2%80%9D.html">1500 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-17-“2% per degree Celsius . . . the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm-hot temperatures”</a></p>

Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.

<p>Introduction: A  recent article  on global warming reminded me of the difficulty of letting the data speak.  William Nordhaus shows the following graph: 
   
   
 
And then he writes:
  
One of the reasons that drawing conclusions on temperature trends is tricky is that the historical temperature series is highly volatile, as can be seen in the figure. The presence of short-term volatility requires looking at long-term trends. A useful analogy is the stock market. Suppose an analyst says that because real stock prices have declined over the last decade (which is true), it follows that there is no upward trend. Here again, an examination of the long-term data would quickly show this to be incorrect. The last decade of temperature and stock market data is not representative of the longer-term trends.


The finding that global temperatures are rising over the last century-plus is one of the most robust findings of climate science and statistics.

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  writes :
  
I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years. The results tell the aggression story using street-level data very clearly  [click to</p><p>6 0.64547217 <a title="1501-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-20-Thermodynamic_Monte_Carlo%3A__Michael_Betancourt%E2%80%99s_new_method_for_simulating_from_difficult_distributions_and_evaluating_normalizing_constants.html">2340 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-20-Thermodynamic Monte Carlo:  Michael Betancourt’s new method for simulating from difficult distributions and evaluating normalizing constants</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After writing  yesterday’s post , I was going through Solomon Hsiang’s blog and found  a post  pointing to three studies from researchers at business schools:
  
Severe Weather and Automobile Assembly Productivity


Gérard P. Cachon, Santiago Gallino and Marcelo Olivares


Abstract: It is expected that climate change could lead to an increased frequency of severe weather. In turn, severe weather intuitively should hamper the productivity of work that occurs outside. But what is the effect of rain, snow, fog, heat and wind on work that occurs indoors, such as the production of automobiles? Using weekly production data from 64 automobile plants in the United States over a ten-year period, we ﬁnd that adverse weather conditions lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in production. For example, one additional day of high wind advisory by the National Weather Service (i.e., maximum winds generally in excess of 44 miles per hour) reduces production by 26%, which is comparable in order of magnitude t</p><p>2 0.93857396 <a title="1501-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-27-Visual_diagnostics_for_discrete-data_regressions.html">929 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-27-Visual diagnostics for discrete-data regressions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff asked me what I thought of  this  recent AJPS article by Brian Greenhill, Michael Ward, and Audrey Sacks, “The Separation Plot: A New Visual Method for Evaluating the Fit of Binary Models.”  It’s similar to a graph of observed vs. predicted values, but using color rather than the y-axis to display the observed values.  It seems like it could be useful, also could be applied more generally to discrete-data regressions with more than two categories.
 
When it comes to checking the model fit, I recommend binned residual plots, as discussed in  this 2000 article  with Yuri Goegebeur, Francis Tuerlinckx, and Iven Van Mechelen.</p><p>3 0.93479455 <a title="1501-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-How_many_parameters_are_in_a_multilevel_model%3F.html">1144 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-How many parameters are in a multilevel model?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stephen Collins writes:
  
I’m reading your Multilevel modeling book and am trying to apply it to my work.  I’m concerned with how to estimate a random intercept model if there are hundreds/thousands of levels.  In the Gibbs sampling, am I sampling a parameter for each level?  Or, just the hyper-parameters?  In other words, say I had 500 zipcode intercepts modeled as ~ N(m,s).  Would my posterior be two dimensional, sampling for “m” and “s,” or would it have 502 dimensions?
  
My reply:  Indeed you will have hundreds or thousands of parameters—or, in classical terms, hundreds or thousands of predictive quantities.  But that’s ok.  Even if none of those predictions is precise, you’re learning  about the model.
 
See page 526 of the book for more discussion of the number of parameters in a multilevel model.</p><p>4 0.93288243 <a title="1501-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-23-AI_Stats_conference_on_Stan_etc..html">1911 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-23-AI Stats conference on Stan etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010.

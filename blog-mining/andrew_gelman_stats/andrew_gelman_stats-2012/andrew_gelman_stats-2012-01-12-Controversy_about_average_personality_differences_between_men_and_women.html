</p><p>3 Echidne  quotes  a  news article  in which one of the study’s authors going overboard:    “Psychologically, men and women are almost a different species,” said study researcher Paul Irwing, of the University of Manchester, in the United Kingdom. [sent-11, score-0.505]
</p><p>4 The new findings may explain why some careers are dominated by men (such as engineering) and others by women (such as psychological sciences), Irwing said. [sent-12, score-0.496]
</p><p>5 It’s too bad that men and women are almost a different species. [sent-14, score-0.505]

</p><p>7 )  If you pick the dimensions in which men and women differ the most, you can find a large separation. [sent-25, score-0.751]
</p><p>8 It makes a lot of sense to look at differences in many dimensions in addition to studying distributions for single measurements or traits. [sent-27, score-0.733]
</p><p>9 From my subjective judgment, there certainly appear to be some traits and behaviors for which men are much different from women, and of course there are big statistical differences in crime rates and in some opinion items. [sent-29, score-0.885]
</p><p>10 OK, so what about that idea that the distributions of men and women overlap by only 10%? [sent-32, score-0.935]
</p><p>11 What they have shown is that, if one takes a large enough set of personality measures and then takes a linear combination to maximize gender differences, one can get a pretty big gender difference. [sent-39, score-0.877]
</p><p>12 As an example, Feingold’s meta-analysis found gender differences in anxiety ranging in magnitude between d = -. [sent-47, score-0.593]
</p><p>13 In a meta-analysis of research on gender differences in temperament – some of it based on parent or other adult report, some of it based on behavioral measures – the effect size for the gender difference in fear was d = -0. [sent-54, score-1.144]
</p><p>14 Too much of the research on gender differences has relied on subjective self-reports, when objective, behavioral measures may show much different results. [sent-62, score-0.931]
</p><p>15 As Hyde says, the mathematics of multivariate distributions are such that if you have two different distributions, as you go into high dimensions the overlap goes down. [sent-66, score-0.854]
</p><p>16 Consider the following simple example in d dimensions with two distributions, x (the continuous personality traits for the population of women) and y (for men). [sent-68, score-0.5]
</p><p>17 The distributions live in d dimensions and are separated by “a” in each dimension, thus the distance between their centers is a*sqrt(d)—think of the distance between opposite vertices of a d-dimensional cube. [sent-73, score-0.765]
</p><p>18 I’m very supportive of work connecting personality to political attitudes, and if I think there can be big differences betweeen Democrats and Republicans, then it certainly seems plausible that there are big differences between men and women. [sent-94, score-1.271]
</p><p>19 If, as I expect, the average differences between men and women are much larger than the differences between those other groups, this would strengthen the published findings. [sent-95, score-1.189]
</p><p>20 If the distributions are identical, the overlap is 100%, if they are far apart, the overlap is near 0. [sent-109, score-0.77]

<p>Introduction: Commenter Tggp  links  to a criticism of science journalist Sharon Begley by science journalist Matthew Hutson.  I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.  For example, “Study 1 indicates that ovul</p><p>4 0.15120162 <a title="1114-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?  It depends on the size of the treatment interactions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):

This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

You’ve probably already seen it, but I thought you could have a lot of fun with this one!!
  
 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years.

<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>5 0.81157255 <a title="1114-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-%E2%80%9CGenomics%E2%80%9D_vs._genetics.html">303 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-“Genomics” vs. genetics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>6 0.8026855 <a title="1114-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-19-Is_coffee_a_killer%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_the_effect_is_as_high_as_was_estimated_from_the_highest_number_that_came_out_of_a_noisy_study.html">2030 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-19-Is coffee a killer?

<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:
  
We [Smith and Zorn] expand the substantive terrain of QI’s reach by illuminating a body of political theory that to date has been elaborated in strictly classical language and formalisms but has complex features that seem to merit generalizations of the prob</p><p>2 0.97447985 <a title="1114-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-%E2%80%9CIncome_can%E2%80%99t_be_used_to_predict_political_opinion%E2%80%9D.html">924 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-“Income can’t be used to predict political opinion”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What really irritates me about  this column  (by John Steele Gordon) is not how stupid it is (an article about “millionaires” that switches  within the very same paragraph  between “a nest egg of $1 million” and “a $1 million annual income” without acknowledging the difference between these concepts) or the ignorance it displays (no, it’s not true that “McCain carried the middle class” in 2008—unless by “middle class” you mean “middle class whites”).
 
No, what really ticks me off is that, when the Red State Blue State book was coming out, we pitched a “5 myths” article for the Washington Post, and they turned us down!  Perhaps the rule is:  if it’s in the Opinions section of the paper, it can’t contain any facts?  Or, to be more precise, any facts it contains must be counterbalanced by an equal number of inanities?
 
Grrrrr . . . I haven’t been so annoyed since reading that  New York Times article  that argued that electoral politics is just like high school.

<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Due to my similar interest in  plagiarism , I went to The Human Cultural and Social Landscape session. [The recipient of the American Statistical Association's Founders Award in 2002] gave the first talk in the session instead of Yasmin Said, which was modestly attended (20 or so people) and gave a sociology talk with no numbers — and no attribution to where these ideas (on Afghanistan culture) came from. Would it really have hurt to give the source of this? I’m on board with plain laziness for this one.


I think he may have mentioned a number of his collaborators at the beginning, and all he talked about were cultural customs and backgrounds, no science to speak of.
  
It’s kind of amazing to me that he actually showed up at JSM, but of course if he had any shame, he wouldn’t have repeatedly  stolen  copied without proper attribution in the first place.  It’s not even like Doris Kearns Goodwin who reportedly produced a well-written book out of it!</p><p>4 0.9698807 <a title="1114-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-21-A_possible_resolution_of_the_albedo_mystery%21.html">622 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-21-A possible resolution of the albedo mystery!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember that bizarre episode in Freakonomics 2, where Levitt and Dubner went to the Batcave-like lair of a genius billionaire who told them that “the problem with solar panels is that they’re  black .”  I’m  not the only one  who wondered at the time:  of all the issues to bring up about solar power, why that one?

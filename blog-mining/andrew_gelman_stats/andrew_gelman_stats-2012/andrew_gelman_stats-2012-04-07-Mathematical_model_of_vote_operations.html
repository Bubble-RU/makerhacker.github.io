<p>Introduction: The other day someone mentioned my complaint about the Wikipedia article on “Bayesian inference” (see footnote 1 of  this article ) and he said I should fix the Wikipedia entry myself.
 
And  so I did .  I didn’t have the energy to rewrite the whole article–in particular, all of its examples involve discrete parameters, whereas the Bayesian problems I work on generally have continuous parameters, and its “mathematical foundations” section focuses on “independent identically distributed observations x” rather than data y which can have different distributions.  It’s just a wacky, unbalanced article.  But I altered the first few paragraphs to get rid of the stuff about the posterior probability that a model is true.
 
I much prefer the  Scholarpedia article on Bayesian statistics  by David Spiegelhalter and Kenneth Rice, but I couldn’t bring myself to simply delete the Wikipedia article and replace it with the Scholarpedia content.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.  For example, from an  official documen t, “The primary purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participati</p><p>5 0.10183153 <a title="1251-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-The_Tweets-Votes_Curve.html">1823 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-The Tweets-Votes Curve</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas points me to  this excellently-titled working paper  by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen, and himself:
  
Is social media a valid indicator of political behavior? We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion. With over 500 million active users in 2012, Twitter now represents a new frontier for the study of human behavior. This research provides a framework for incorporating this emerging medium into the computational social science toolkit.

<p>Introduction: Expectation propagation and approximate Bayesian computation.
 
Here are X’s  comments  on a paper, “Expectation-Propagation for Likelihood-Free Inference,” by Simon Barthelme and Nicolas Chopin.  The paper is not new but the topic is still hot.
 
Also there’s  this paper  by Maurizio Filippone and Mark Girolami on computation for Gaussian process models.  I wonder how this connects to  GPstuff , which I think is what Aki did to fit the birthdays model:

<p>Introduction: I received the following email the other day:
  
Given your past criticisms of this issue in your posts, I do not think you will like  my co-authored paper , “Microfoundations of the Business Cycle and Monetary Shocks” . . .
  
Given this lead-in, of course I had to take a look.  The paper is by James Holmes, John Holmes, and Patricia Hutton, it’s called “Microfoundations of the Business Cycle and Monetary Shocks,” and they say:
  
Non-rational expectations can produce larger expected real income for some or all agents than rational expectations. . . . Hence, “rational expectations” are not rational, and “money illusion” can be optimal and satisfy the “Lucas Critique.” . . . Nominal wage rigidity or stickiness can be the rational response of firms or workers and need not be evidence of money illusion.
  
I asked Holmes why he thought I would not like the paper, as I am not opposed to microfoundations when they are of interest.  My  opposition  is to the attitude that microfoundations a</p><p>4 0.67365533 <a title="1251-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-26-The_reverse-journal-submission_system.html">1393 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-26-The reverse-journal-submission system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve whined before in this space that some of my most important, innovative, and influential papers are really hard to get published.  I’ll go through endless hassle with a journal or sometimes several journals until I find some place willing to publish.  It’s just irritating.
 
I was thinking about this recently because a colleague and I just finished a paper that I love love love.  But I can’t figure out where to submit it.  This is a paper for which I would prefer the so-called reverse-journal-submission approach.  Instead of sending the paper to journal after journal after journal, waiting years until an acceptance (recall that, unless you’re Bruno Frey, you’re not allowed to submit the same paper to multiple journals simultaneously), you post the paper on a public site, and then journals compete to see who gets to publish it.  I think that system would work well with a paper like this which is offbeat but has a nontrivial chance of becoming highly influential.

<p>Introduction: Daniel Sgroi and Andrew Oswald  write :
  
Many governments wish to assess the quality of their universities. A prominent example is the UK’s new Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014. In the REF, peer-review panels will be provided with information on publications and citations. This paper suggests a way in which panels could choose the weights to attach to these two indicators. The analysis draws in an intuitive way on the concept of Bayesian updating (where citations gradually reveal information about the initially imperfectly-observed importance of the research). Our study should not be interpreted as the argument that only mechanistic measures ought to be used in a REF.
  
I agree that, if you’re going to choose a weighted average, it makes sense to think about where the weights are coming from.  Some aspects of Sgroi and Oswald’s proposal remind me of the old idea of evaluating journal articles by expected number of total citations.  The idea is that you’d use four pieces of i</p><p>6 0.66092902 <a title="1251-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-30-Why_don%E2%80%99t_we_have_peer_reviewing_for_oral_presentations%3F.html">172 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-30-Why don’t we have peer reviewing for oral presentations?</a></p>

With its model of independent identically distributed votes, the paper is a bit theoretical for my taste, but maybe it will interest some of you.</p><p>2 0.84672296 <a title="1251-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-14-The_General_Social_Survey_is_a_great_resource.html">958 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-14-The General Social Survey is a great resource</a></p>

Two great things about the General Social Survey are:  (1) the data are freely available  online , and (2) the same questions have been asked since 1972 so you get a nice long series.</p><p>3 0.84312844 <a title="1251-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-21-A_possible_resolution_of_the_albedo_mystery%21.html">622 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-21-A possible resolution of the albedo mystery!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember that bizarre episode in Freakonomics 2, where Levitt and Dubner went to the Batcave-like lair of a genius billionaire who told them that “the problem with solar panels is that they’re  black .”  I’m  not the only one  who wondered at the time:  of all the issues to bring up about solar power, why that one?
 
Well, I think I’ve found the answer in  this article  by John Lanchester:
  
In 2004, Nathan Myhrvold, who had, five years earlier, at the advanced age of forty, retired from his job as Microsoft’s chief technology officer, began to contribute to the culinary discussion board egullet.org . . . At the time he grew interested in sous vide, there was no book in English on the subject, and he resolved to write one. . . . broadened it further to include information about the basic physics of heating processes, then to include the physics and chemistry of traditional cooking techniques, and then to include the science and practical application of the highly inventive new techniq</p><p>4 0.83297288 <a title="1251-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Applying_quantum_probability_to_political_science.html">877 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Applying quantum probability to political science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:
  
We [Smith and Zorn] expand the substantive terrain of QI’s reach by illuminating a body of political theory that to date has been elaborated in strictly classical language and formalisms but has complex features that seem to merit generalizations of the prob</p><p>5 0.81456453 <a title="1251-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-21-Most_Popular_Girl_Names_by_State_over_Time.html">2071 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-21-Most Popular Girl Names by State over Time</a></p>

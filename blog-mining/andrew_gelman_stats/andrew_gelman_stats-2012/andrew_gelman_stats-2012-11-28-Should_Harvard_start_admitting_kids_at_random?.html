</p><p>4 On the other hand, if the threshold is lower, there’s less of an attraction to teaching at Harvard; maybe that’s part of the point. [sent-6, score-0.162]

</p><p>6 He argues that the current system is so screwed up that it would possible to improve on both dimensions (although at a cost to the colleges’ sports teams). [sent-8, score-0.212]
</p><p>7 One thing that Unz does not discuss is the possibility of a college changing its composition midstream, by kicking out some students who can’t hack it and then admitting an equivalent number of transfer students to take their place. [sent-9, score-0.695]
</p><p>8 I’ve always liked this idea, and it seems like more of a possibility if you start admitting students at random. [sent-10, score-0.351]

</p><p>10 You might imagine that some non-elite college could try Unz’s system, but the trouble there is that such colleges are trying so hard to get OK enough applicants who can pay the bills, that it’s not clear they have much room to maneuver. [sent-14, score-0.447]
</p><p>11 The more equal representation that Unz might be easier to achieve at the back end, by having various institutions refuse to hire so many Ivy graduates or to fund Ivy projects. [sent-15, score-0.181]

After seeing the statistics, I don’t see it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.

<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.  Negotiation doesn</p><p>4 0.42746463 <a title="1595-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-22-Ivy_Jew_update.html">2073 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-22-Ivy Jew update</a></p>

In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show.

Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

I noticed that you have blogged a little about interstate migration trends in the US, and thought  that you might be interested in  a new working paper  of mine (joint with Sam Schulhofer-Wohl from the Minneapolis Fed) which I have attached.


Briefly, we show that much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact: The Census Bureau made an undocumented change in its imputation procedures for missing data in 2006, and this change significantly reduced the number of imputed interstate moves. The change in imputation procedures — not any actual change in migration behavior — explains 90 percent of the reported decrease in interstate migration between the 2005 and 2006 Current Population Surveys, and 42 percent of the decrease between 2000 and 2010.

My reply:  All’s well with me.  And yes, that’s one horrible graph.  It has all the problems with a bad infographic with none of the virtues.  Compared to this monstrosity, the typical USA Today graph is a stunning, beautiful masterpiece.  I don’t think I want to soil this webpage with the image.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  article  where Ron Unz provides evidence that Jews are way overrepresented at Ivy League colleges, with Asians-Americans and non-Jewish whites correspondingly underrepresented.  Unz attributes this to bias and pressure in the admissions office and recommends that, instead, top colleges should switch to a system based purely academic credentials (he never clearly defines these, but I assume he’s talking about high school grades, SAT scores, and prizes in recognized academic competitions).  He recommends that Harvard, for example, get rid of preferences for athletes, musicians, and rich people, and instead reserve one-fifth of their slots based on pure academic merit and with the remaining four-fifth “being randomly selected from the 30,000 or so American applicants considered able to reasonably perform at the school’s required academic level and thereby benefit from a Harvard education.”

<p>Introduction: Now here’s a foundation I (Bob) can get behind: 
  

 Foundation for Open Access Statistics  (FOAS)

  
Their  mission  is to “promote free software, open access publishing, and reproducible research in statistics.”  To me, that’s like supporting  motherhood and apple pie !
 
FOAS spun out of and is partially designed to support the   Journal of Statistical Software   (aka  JSS , aka  JStatSoft ). I adore  JSS  because it (a) is open access, (b) publishes systems papers on statistical software, (c) has fast reviewing turnaround times, and (d) is free for authors and readers.  One of the next items on my to-do list is to write up the  Stan  modeling language and submit it to  JSS .
 
As a not-for-profit with no visible source of income, they are quite sensibly  asking for donations  (don’t complain — it beats $3K author fees or not being able to read papers).</p><p>5 0.92831039 <a title="1595-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-30-More_on_problems_with_surveys_estimating_deaths_in_war_zones.html">12 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-30-More on problems with surveys estimating deaths in war zones</a></p>

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>6 0.9126789 <a title="1595-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Help_with_this_problem%2C_win_valuable_prizes.html">1164 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Help with this problem, win valuable prizes</a></p>

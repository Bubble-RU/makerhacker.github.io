My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

</p><p>4 I have come across some other of Myhrvold’s writings and he seems like a bit of a crank. [sent-20, score-0.164]
</p><p>5 Considering points 2-4 above, I think it’s fair to say that in his recent writings, Levitt has been a bit too quick to trust the work of his friends. [sent-23, score-0.119]
</p><p>6 There are also a bunch of other examples that we didn’t have room for in our article (we had to cut a lot for space limitations), for example in October 2008 endorsing his U of C colleague Casey Mulligan’s “economic arguments as to why things are not so bad. [sent-25, score-0.144]

</p><p>8 I don’t think there’s anything wrong with us pointing out the contradictions and difficulties that arise from this role. [sent-35, score-0.182]
</p><p>9 For that matter, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with  not  being a rogue. [sent-36, score-0.182]
</p><p>10 To return to point 1 above, I think Levitt did a great service by writing Freakonomics (and doing the research on which the book was based) and also continuing with the Freakonomics blog. [sent-45, score-0.1]
</p><p>11 Commendably, they don’t put themselves above the fray but rather are open about the active nature of scientific theorizing. [sent-47, score-0.103]
</p><p>12 For example, getting back to item 2 above,  Levitt and Dubner were sitting on a wonderful story about how a smart economist made a mistake  and how that economist refused to admit error for a couple of years even when the experts in the field showed evidence that she was wrong. [sent-49, score-0.478]
</p><p>13 But instead Levitt flattened the story by making the economist the hero  and never mentioning the others. [sent-50, score-0.226]
</p><p>14 There was talk of the government hiring Levitt to apply his Freakonomics tools to catch terrorists. [sent-61, score-0.096]
</p><p>15 ”  Freakonomics was once a forum for a playful discussion of serious, important ideas; now it’s more of a grab-bag of unfounded arguments. [sent-63, score-0.096]
</p><p>16 In reporting and discussing some cases of questionable judgment on the part of the Freakonomics team, Kaiser and I were not trying to shoot down Freakonomics but to explore what went wrong:  What moved them on the track from serious popular science to a walking punch line? [sent-67, score-0.184]
</p><p>17 That’s how you get an uncritical trust in an economist with a wrong theory of sex ratios, an albedo-obsessed software executive, an economist who claimed in October 2008 that “things are just not that bad,” Daryl Bem, and . [sent-69, score-0.69]
</p><p>18 My guess is that Levitt takes his academic writing seriously but think of the Freakonomics books and blogs as just for fun. [sent-73, score-0.101]
</p><p>19 But if they would admit their mistakes (rather than either ignoring them or going on the offensive when people point out problems), maybe they could move back to their former role of serious communicators of social science. [sent-75, score-0.189]

<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>3 0.51467538 <a title="1100-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>4 0.51261926 <a title="1100-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>5 0.48723668 <a title="1100-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-20-A_kaleidoscope_of_responses_to_Dubner%E2%80%99s_criticisms_of_our_criticisms_of_Freaknomics.html">1223 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-20-A kaleidoscope of responses to Dubner’s criticisms of our criticisms of Freaknomics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  pointed  me to a new  blog post  by Stephen Dubner in which he expresses disagreement with what Kaiser and I wrote in our American Scientist  article , “Freakonomics:  What Went Wrong?”.
 
In response, I thought it would be interesting to go “meta” here by considering all the different ways ways that I  could  reply to Dubner’s criticism of our criticism of his writings.  (In the same post, Dubner also slams Chris Blattman (or, as he calls him, “a man named Chris Blattman”), but I won’t get into that here.)
 
In reacting to Dubner, I will give several perspectives,  all of which I believe .  Usually in writing a response, one would have to choose, but here I find it interesting to present all these different perspectives in one place.
 
 1.  Understand. 
 
I understand where Dubner is coming from.    We say some positive things and some negative things about his work, but it’s natural for him to focus on the negative.

<p>Introduction: Steven Levitt  writes :.
  
 
Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.
 
P.S.  Levitt also writes:
  
The one thing that puzzles me [Levitt] is why in the world would he want to be on the Board of the Federal Reserve? One thing economists just don’t understand are people’s preferences.
  
To get meta here for a moment . . . just as Levitt can’t understand Diamond’s preferences, I find it extremely difficult to understand that Levitt is puzzled by Diamond’s desire to serve on the Federal Reserve,
 
It’s obvious, no?

P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>4 0.91745526 <a title="1100-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>5 0.88565838 <a title="1100-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-20-A_kaleidoscope_of_responses_to_Dubner%E2%80%99s_criticisms_of_our_criticisms_of_Freaknomics.html">1223 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-20-A kaleidoscope of responses to Dubner’s criticisms of our criticisms of Freaknomics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  pointed  me to a new  blog post  by Stephen Dubner in which he expresses disagreement with what Kaiser and I wrote in our American Scientist  article , “Freakonomics:  What Went Wrong?”.
 
In response, I thought it would be interesting to go “meta” here by considering all the different ways ways that I  could  reply to Dubner’s criticism of our criticism of his writings.  (In the same post, Dubner also slams Chris Blattman (or, as he calls him, “a man named Chris Blattman”), but I won’t get into that here.)
 
In reacting to Dubner, I will give several perspectives,  all of which I believe .  Usually in writing a response, one would have to choose, but here I find it interesting to present all these different perspectives in one place.
 
 1.  Understand.

<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>3 0.98182607 <a title="1100-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-06-Against_optimism_about_social_science.html">1844 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-06-Against optimism about social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Social science research has been getting pretty bad press recently, what with the Excel buccaneers who didn’t know how to handle data with different numbers of observations per country, and the psychologist who published dozens of papers based on fabricated data, and the Evilicious guy who wouldn’t let people review his data tapes, etc etc.  And that’s not even considering Dr. Anil Potti.
 
On the other hand, the revelation of all these problems can be taken as evidence that things are getting better.  Psychology researcher Gary Marcus  writes :
  
There is something positive that has come out of the crisis of replicability—something vitally important for all experimental sciences. For years, it was extremely difficult to publish a direct replication, or a failure to replicate an experiment, in a good journal. . . . Now, happily, the scientific culture has changed. . . . The Reproducibility Project, from the Center for Open Science is now underway . . .

<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.
 
2.  I think it was at best tacky and</p><p>5 0.97980022 <a title="1100-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-05-An_unexpected_benefit_of_Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">746 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-05-An unexpected benefit of Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  my remarks  on Arrow’s theorem (the weak form of Arrow’s Theorem is that any result can be published no more than five times. The strong form is that every result will be published five times), I meant no criticism of Bruno Frey, the author of the articles in question:  I agree that it can be a contribution to publish in multiple places.  Regarding the evaluation of contributions, it should be possible to evaluate research contributions and also evaluate communication.  One problem is that communication is both under- and over-counted.  It’s undercounted in that we mostly get credit for original ideas not for exposition; it’s overcounted in that we need communication skills to publish in the top journals.  But I don’t think these two biases cancel out.
 
The real reason I’m bringing this up, though, is because Arrow’s theorem happened to me recently and in interesting way.  Here’s the story.

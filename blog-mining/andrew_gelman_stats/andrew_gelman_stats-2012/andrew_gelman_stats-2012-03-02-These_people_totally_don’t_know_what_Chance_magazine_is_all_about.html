<p>Introduction: The only thing is, I’m not sure who’s David here and who is Goliath.  From the standpoint of book sales, Gladwell is Goliath for sure.  On the other hand, Gladwell’s credibility has been weakened over the years by fights with bigshots such as Steven Pinker.  Maybe the best analogy is a boxing match where Gladwell stands in the ring and fighter after fighter is sent in to bang him up.  At some point the heavyweight gets a little bit tired. (Recently Gladwell had a New Yorker column defending dopers such as Lance Armstrong, so I suspect he’ll have Kaiser Fung  coming  after him  again , once the current lucha with Chabris is over.)
 
Chabris took his swing at Gladwell a few days ago, as I reported  here .
 
Yesterday was Gladwell’s  turn .  I have a lot of sympathy for the Blink-man here:  he writes these bestsellers and puts himself out there, so he’s a target.  If Gladwell’s books were generic business-bestseller pap of the be-yourself-and-be-tough variety, he wouldn’t get hassled.

<p>Introduction: Someone who wishes to remain anonymous writes: 
  
  
I’ve been following your blog a long time and enjoy your posts on visualization/statistical graphics matters.  I don’t recall however you ever describing the details of your setup for plotting.  I’m a new R user (convert from matplotlib) and would love to know your thoughts on the ideal setup: do you use mainly the R base?  Do you use lattice?  What do you think of ggplot2?  etc.  


I found ggplot2 nearly indecipherable until a recent eureka moment, and I think its default theme is a waste tremendous ink (all those silly grey backgrounds and grids are really unnecessary), but if you customize that away it can be made to look like ordinary, pretty statistical graphs.  


Feel free to respond on your blog, but if you do, please remove my name from the post (my colleagues already make fun of me for thinking about visualization too much.) 
  
I love that last bit!

<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>5 0.071660705 <a title="1192-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-12-Niall_Ferguson%2C_the_John_Yoo_line%2C_and_the_paradox_of_influence.html">1493 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-12-Niall Ferguson, the John Yoo line, and the paradox of influence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Life is continuous but we think in discrete terms.  In applied statistics there’s the p=.05 line which tells us whether a finding is significant or not.  Baseball has the Mendoza line.
 
And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site.

Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.

He is also very, very adorable.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t want this to be a regular feature but I wanted to briefly comment on Ferguson’s  open letter  regarding the Keynes-was-a-ballet-and-poetry-loving-poof remarks he made the other day at that conference of financial advisors.  (I’m posting this one at night, and a new post on an unrelated topic is coming in the morning, so I’m burying it as much as possible.)
 
Ferguson reiterates that his remarks were “stupid.”  The question then arises:  He’s a smart guy, how did he end up saying such stupid things?  Ferguson has a history of saying high-profile stupid things, and they always seem to be when he’s trying to make some sort of political point.
 
I’m still going with  my theory  that Ferguson misjudged his audience; he thought they’d appreciate an anti-Keynes remark, maybe he even thought they were the kind of crowd that would enjoy cracks about gay people who like ballet and poetry. No go.
 
Again, I’m not trying to nail the guy to the cross for this.  We all make mistakes; in fact</p><p>3 0.67093098 <a title="1192-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-03-Absolutely_last_Niall_Ferguson_post_ever%2C_in_which_I_offer_him_serious_advice.html">1040 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-03-Absolutely last Niall Ferguson post ever, in which I offer him serious advice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of reading  this article  by Niall Ferguson summarizing his  notorious  new book.  Here’s the best bit: 
  
  
Far more than in Europe, most Americans remain instinctively loyal to the killer applications of Western ascendancy, from competition all the way through to the work ethic. They know the country has the right software. They just can’t understand why it’s running so damn slowly.


What we need to do is to delete the viruses that have crept into our system: the anticompetitive quasi monopolies that blight everything from banking to public education; the politically correct pseudosciences and soft subjects that deflect good students away from hard science; the lobbyists who subvert the rule of law for the sake of the special interests they represent—to say nothing of our crazily dysfunctional system of health care, our overleveraged personal finances, and our newfound unemployment ethic.

<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

<p>Introduction: In the inbox today, under the header, “Hidden Costs behind Milk & Dairy Consumption (video)”:
  
Hey Professor Gelman,


Our site’s production team recently released a short video uncovering the local and global impact that milk has on our lives.


After spending some time on your posts, I noticed you talked about dairy products and milk so I thought I’d email you. Are you the correct person to contact in regards to the content on the site? 


If so, let me know if you’re interested in checking out the video.

<p>Introduction: I used  this convenient site  to create some images for a talk I’m preparing.  (The competing headlines:  “Beautiful parents have more daughters” vs. “No compelling evidence that beautiful parents are more or less likely to have daughters.”  The latter gets cut off at “No compelling evidence that,” which actually works pretty well to demonstrate the sort of dull headline that would result if newspapers were to publish null results.)</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88583577 <a title="1192-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-02-These_people_totally_don%E2%80%99t_know_what_Chance_magazine_is_all_about.html">1192 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-02-These people totally don’t know what Chance magazine is all about</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).

<p>Introduction: Something on Applied Bayesian Statistics
 
April 27, 4:10-5 p.m., 1011 Evans Hall
 
I will deliver  one  of the following three talks: 
1.  Of beauty, sex, and power: Statistical challenges in estimating small effects  
2.  Why we (usually) don’t worry about multiple comparisons  
3.  Parameterization and Bayesian modeling  
Whoever shows up on time to the seminar gets to vote, and I’ll give the talk that gets the most votes.</p><p>4 0.79884839 <a title="1192-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-01-A_book_with_a_bunch_of_simple_graphs.html">1439 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-01-A book with a bunch of simple graphs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

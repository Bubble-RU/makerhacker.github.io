<p>Introduction: I just gave my first Skype presentation today, and it felt pretty strange.
 
The technical difficulties mostly arose with the sound.  There were heavy echoes and so we ended up just cutting off the sound from the audience.  This made it more difficult for me because I couldn’t gauge audience reaction.  It was a real challenge to give a talk without being able to hear the laughter of the audience.  (I asked them to wave their hands every time they laughed, but they didn’t do so–or else they were never laughing, which would be even worse.)
 
Next time I’ll use the telephone for at least one of the sound channels.
 
The visuals were ok from my side–I just went thru my slides one by one, using the cursor to point to things.  I prefer standing next to the screen and pointing with my hands.  But doing it this way was ok, considering.
 
The real visual problem went the other way:  I couldn’t really see the audience.

<p>Introduction: At the City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue (between 34th and 35th street), room 6002.  The topic:   causality and statistical learning .  Announcement is  here  (scroll down).  It says that if you would like to attend any event, please respond by emailing datamining@gc.cuny.edu
 
I’m also giving a shorter talk on the same topic in the Sustainable Development Seminar  Series  4pm Monday 29 Apr in room 407 International Affairs Bldg (at 118th St. and Amsterdam Ave.).
 
It’s just a coincidence that I’m giving the same talk twice.  I was asked at different times to speak for these groups.

<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>4 0.72516954 <a title="1451-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-09-%EF%BF%BCLittle_Data%3A_How_traditional_statistical_ideas_remain_relevant_in_a_big-data_world.html">1526 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-09-￼Little Data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big-data world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: See if you can interpolate the talk from the  slides .
 
The background is:  I was invited to speak in this seminar on “big data.”  I said I didn’t know anything about big data, I worked on little data.  They said that was ok.  Actually it was probably a crowd-pleasing move to tell these people that little-data ideas remain relevant.</p><p>5 0.72257066 <a title="1451-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-20-Not_quite_getting_the_point.html">1073 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-20-Not quite getting the point</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I gave  this talk  the other day and afterwards, a white guy came up to me and said he thought it was no coincidence that the researcher who made the mistake was “Oriental.”  He then went on for about 5 minutes explaining his theory.  I couldn’t keep myself from laughing—I had to start coughing into a napkin to hide it.</p><p>6 0.72163665 <a title="1451-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-12-Picking_pennies_in_front_of_a_steamroller%3A__A_parable_comes_to_life.html">512 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-12-Picking pennies in front of a steamroller:  A parable comes to life</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago Larry Bartels  presented  this graph, a version of which latter appeared in his book Unequal Democracy:
 
 
 
Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy. This is consistent with Democrats’ general policies of lowering unemployment, as compared to Republicans lowering inflation, and, by comparing first-term to second-term presidents, he found that the result couldn’t simply be explained as a rebound or alternation pattern.
 
The question then arose, why have the Republicans won so many elections? Why aren’t the Democrats consistently dominating? Non-economic issues are part of the story, of course, but lots of evidence shows the economy to be a key concern for voters, so it’s still hard to see how, with a pattern such as shown above, the Republicans could keep winning.
 
Larry had some explanations, largely having to do with timing:  under De</p><p>4 0.99241185 <a title="1451-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Dave Backus points me to  this review  by anthropologist Mike McGovern of two books by economist Paul Collier on the politics of economic development in Africa.  My first reaction was that this was interesting but non-statistical so I’d have to either post it on the sister blog or wait until the 30 days of statistics was over.  But then I looked more carefully and realized that this discussion is very relevant to applied statistics. 
 
Here’s McGovern’s substantive critique:
  
Much of the fundamental intellectual work in Collier’s analyses is, in fact, ethnographic. Because it is not done very self-consciously and takes place within a larger econometric rhetoric in which such forms of knowledge are dismissed as “subjective” or worse still biased by the political (read “leftist”) agendas of the academics who create them, it is often ethnography of a low quality. . . .


Despite the adoption of a Naipaulian unsentimental-dispatches-from-the-trenches rhetoric, the story told in Collier’s</p><p>6 0.98985684 <a title="1451-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-20-Adding_more_information_can_make_the_variance_go_up_%28depending_on_your_model%29.html">810 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-20-Adding more information can make the variance go up (depending on your model)</a></p>

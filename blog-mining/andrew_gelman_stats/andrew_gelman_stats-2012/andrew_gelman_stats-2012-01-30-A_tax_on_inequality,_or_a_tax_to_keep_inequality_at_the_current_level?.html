<p>Introduction: Reihan Salam  discusses  a theory of Tyler Cowen regarding “threshold earners,” a sort of upscale version of a slacker.   Here’s Cowen :
  
A threshold earner is someone who seeks to earn a certain amount of money and no more. If wages go up, that person will respond by seeking less work or by working less hard or less often. That person simply wants to “get by” in terms of absolute earning power in order to experience other gains in the form of leisure.
  
Salam continues:
  
This clearly reflects the pattern of wage dispersion among my friends, particularly those who attended elite secondary schools and colleges and universities. I [Salam] know many “threshold earners,” including both high and low earners who could earn much more if they chose to make the necessary sacrifices. But they are satisficers.
  
OK, fine so far.  But then the claim is made that “threshold earning” behavior increases income inequality.  In Cowen’s words:

<p>Introduction: From my  New York Times blog  today, here’s an example of how contemporaneous poll results can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
 
Recently in the New Republic,  William Galston  shared some recent findings from Gallup:
  
Respondents were asked to categorize three economic objectives as extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not important. Here’s what they said:


Extremely/very important          Somewhat/not important


Grow and expand the economy                                         82                                            18


Increase equality of opportunity for people to get ahead                                             70                                            30


Reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and the poor                                  46                                            54

<p>Introduction: Greg Mankiw  writes  (link from  Tyler Cowen ):
  
Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000. I would have twice the incentive to keep working.
  
 First, the good news 
 
Obama’s tax rates are much lower than Mankiw had anticipated!  According to the above quote, his marginal tax rate is currently 80% but threatens to rise to 90%.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to a  blog  by Greg Mankiw with further details on his argument that his anticipated 90% marginal tax rate will reduce his work level.
 
Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.

Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000.

By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different.

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>2 0.93648219 <a title="1145-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-06-Why_your_Klout_score_is_meaningless.html">748 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-06-Why your Klout score is meaningless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Braunstein  writes  about Klout, a company which measures Twitter/Facebook influence:
  
As a Ph D statistician and search quality engineer, I [Braunstein] know a lot about how to properly measure things. In the past few months I’ve become an active Twitter user and very interested in measuring the influence of individuals. Klout provides a way to measure influence on Twitter using a score also called Klout. The range is 0 to 100. Light users score below 20, regular users around 30, and celebrities start around 75. Naturally, I was intrigued by the Klout measurement, but a careful analysis led to some serious issues with the score. . . .
  
Braunstein continues with some comparisons of different twitter-users and how their Klout scores don’t make much sense.  I don’t really see the point of the Klout scores in the first place:  I guess they’re supposed to be a quick measure to use in pricing advertising?  Whatever, I don’t really care.

<p>Introduction: My sometime coauthor Aaron Edlin cowrote (with Ian Ayres)  an op-ed  recommending a clever approach to taxing the rich.
 
In their article they employ a charming bit of economics jargon, using the word “earn” to mean “how much money you make.”  They “propose an automatic extra tax on the income of the top 1 percent of earners.”  I assume their tax would apply to unearned income as well, but they (or their editor at the Times) are just so used to describing income as “earnings” that they just threw that in.  Funny.
 
Also, there’s a part of the article that doesn’t make sense to me. 
   
Ayres and Edlin first describe the level of inequality:
  
In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.
  
Then they lay out their solution:
  
Enough is enough. . . . we propose an automatic extra tax on the income</p><p>4 0.93078387 <a title="1145-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-NYC_Data_Skeptics_Meetup.html">1837 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-NYC Data Skeptics Meetup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt writes:
  
The hype surrounding Big Data and Data Science is at a fever pitch with promises to solve the worldâ&euro;&trade;s business and social problems, large and small. How accurate or misleading is this message? How is it helping or damaging people, and which people? What opportunities exist for data nerds and entrepreneurs that examine the larger issues with a skeptical view?


 This Meetup  focuses on mathematical, ethical, and business aspects of data from a skeptical perspective. Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling. We will take deep dives into models in the fields of Data Science, statistics, financial engineering, and economics.

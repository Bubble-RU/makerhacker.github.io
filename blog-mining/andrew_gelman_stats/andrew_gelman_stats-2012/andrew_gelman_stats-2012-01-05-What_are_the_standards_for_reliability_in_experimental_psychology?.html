Here’s a presentation of data from the application: 
   
 
 
 Transparency International  could make something like this much more widely available around the  world .
 
While awareness is good, follow-up is even better. For example, it’s known that New York’s subway signal inspections  were being falsified . Signal inspections are pretty serious stuff, as failures lead to  disasters , such as the one in Washington. Nothing much happened after: the person responsible (making $163k a year) was merely  reassigned .</p><p>3 0.094435766 <a title="1101-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-17-How_to_think_about_the_statistical_evidence_when_the_statistical_evidence_can%E2%80%99t_be_conclusive%3F.html">2174 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-17-How to think about the statistical evidence when the statistical evidence can’t be conclusive?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>4 0.090407357 <a title="1101-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-09-Commercial_Bayesian_inference_software_is_popping_up_all_over.html">1489 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-09-Commercial Bayesian inference software is popping up all over</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Cohen writes:
  
As someone who has been working with Bayesian statistical models for the past several years, I [Cohen] have been challenged recently to describe the difference between Bayesian Networks (as implemented in BayesiaLab software) and modeling and inference using MCMC methods.


I hope you have the time to give me (or to write on your blog) and relatively simple explanation that an advanced layman could understand.
  
My reply:
 
I skimmed the above website but I couldn’t quite see what they do.  My guess is that they use MCMC and also various parametric approximations such as variational Bayes.  They also seem to have something set up for decision analysis.
 
My guess is that, compared to a general-purpose tool such as Stan, this Bayesia software is more accessible to non-academics in particular application areas (in this case, it looks like business marketing).  But I can’t be sure.

Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers   


Virgil Gligor Carnegie Mellon University 


We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scams/deception. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced</p><p>3 0.68392909 <a title="1101-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-08-The_never-ending_%28and_often_productive%29_race_between_theory_and_practice.html">2127 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-08-The never-ending (and often productive) race between theory and practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Wonks Anonymous  writes :
  
After the recent EconNobel announcement I decided to check Dimensional’s Fama-French blog to see if it had much new content recently, and while it was dissapointingly sparse it did have an interesting bit where Fama linked to the  best advice he’d ever gotten , from his statistics professor Harry Roberts:

 
With formal statistics, you say something — a hypothesis — and then you test it. Harry always said that your criterion should be not whether or not you can reject or accept the hypothesis, but what you can learn from the data. The best thing you can do is use the data to enhance your description of the world.
 
  
I responded:  That’s a great quote. Except that I disagree with what Fama says about “formal statistics.” Or, should I say, he has an old-fashioned view of formal statistics. (See  this paper  by X and me for some discussion of old-fashioned views.) Nowadays, lots of formal statistics is all about what you can learn from the data, no</p><p>4 0.67170286 <a title="1101-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-Where_do_theories_come_from%3F.html">1861 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-Where do theories come from?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lee Sechrest sends along  this article  by Brian Haig and writes that it “presents what seems to me a useful perspective on much of what scientists/statisticians do and how science works, at least in the fields in which I work.”  Here’s Haig’s abstract: 
  
  
A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

<p>Introduction: I pointed Steven Pinker to my post,  How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless? , and he responded:
  
Clearly it *is* important to call out publicized research whose conclusions are likely to be false. The only danger is that it’s so easy and fun to criticize, with all the perks of intellectual and moral superiority for so little cost, that there is a moral hazard to go overboard and become a professional slasher and snarker. (That’s a common phenomenon among literary critics, especially in the UK.) There’s also the risk of altering the incentive structure for innovative research, so that researchers stick to the safest kinds of paradigm-twiddling. I think these two considerations were what my late colleague Dan Wegner had in mind when he made the bumbler-pointer contrast — he himself was certainly a discerning critic of social science research.

<p>Introduction: We have lots of models for overdispersed count data but we rarely see underdispersed data.  But now I know what example I’ll be giving when this next comes up in class.  From a  book review  by Theo Tait:
  
A number of shark species go in for oophagy, or uterine cannibalism. Sand tiger foetuses ‘eat each other in utero, acting out the harshest form of sibling rivalry imaginable’. Only two babies emerge, one from each of the mother shark’s uteruses: the survivors have eaten everything else. ‘A female sand tiger gives birth to a baby that’s already a metre long and an experienced killer,’ explains Demian Chapman, an expert on the subject.
  
That’s what I call underdispersion.  E(y)=2, var(y)=0.  Take that, M.

<p>Introduction: An experimental psychologist was wondering about the standards in that field for “acceptable reliability” (when looking at inter-rater reliability in coding data).  He wondered, for example, if some variation on signal detectability theory might be applied to adjust for inter-rater differences in criteria for saying some code is present.
 
What about Cohen’s kappa?  The psychologist wrote:
  
Cohen’s kappa does adjust for “guessing,” but its assumptions are not well motivated, perhaps not any more than adjustments for guessing versus the application of signal detectability theory where that can be applied. But one can’t do a straightforward application of signal detectability theory for reliability in that you don’t know whether the signal is present or not.
  
I think measurement issues are important but I don’t have enough experience in this area to answer the question without knowing more about the problem that this researcher is working on.

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>5 0.84833014 <a title="1101-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-16-%E2%80%9CReal_data_can_be_a_pain%E2%80%9D.html">1460 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-16-“Real data can be a pain”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael McLaughlin sent me the following query with the above title.
  
Some time ago, I [McLaughlin] was handed a dataset that needed to be modeled.  It was generated as follows:


1. Random navigation errors, historically a binary mixture of normal and Laplace with a common mean, were collected by observation.


2. Sadly, these data were recorded with too few decimal places so that the resulting quantization is clearly visible in a scatterplot.


3. The quantized data were then interpolated (to an unobserved location).


The final result looks like fuzzy points (small scale jitter) at quantized intervals spanning a much larger scale (the parent mixture distribution).  This fuzziness, likely ~normal or ~Laplace, results from the interpolation.  Otherwise, the data would look like a discrete analogue of the normal/Laplace mixture.


I would like to characterize the latent normal/Laplace mixture distribution but the quantization is “getting in the way”.

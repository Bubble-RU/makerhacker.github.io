<p>Introduction: Marc Tanguay writes in with a specific question that has a very general answer.  First, the question:
  
I [Tanguay] am currently running a MCMC for which I have 3 parameters that are restricted to a specific space. 2 are bounded between 0 and 1 while the third is binary and updated by a Beta-Binomial. Since my priors are also bounded, I notice that, conditional on All the rest (which covers both data and other parameters), the density was not varying a lot within the space of the parameters. As a result, the acceptance rate is high, about 85%, and this despite the fact that all the parameter’s space is explore. Since in your book, the optimal acceptance rates prescribed are lower that 50% (in case of multiple parameters), do you think I should worry about getting 85%.  Or is this normal given the restrictions on the parameters?
  
First off:  Yes, my guess is that you should be taking bigger jumps.  85% seems like too high an acceptance rate for Metropolis jumping.

<p>Introduction: I have an optimization problem:  I have a complicated physical model that predicts energy and thermal behavior of a building, given the values of a slew of parameters, such as insulation effectiveness, window transmissivity, etc.  I’m trying to find the parameter set that best fits several weeks of thermal and energy use data from the real building that we modeled. (Of course I would rather explore parameter space and come up with probability distributions for the parameters, and maybe that will come later, but for now I’m just optimizing).  To do the optimization, colleagues and I implemented a “particle swarm optimization” algorithm on a massively parallel machine. This involves giving each of about 120 “particles” an initial position in parameter space, then letting them move around, trying to move to better positions according to a specific algorithm.  We gave each particle an initial position sampled from our prior distribution for each parameter.

<p>Introduction: Tomas Iesmantas writes:
  
I’m facing a problem where parameter space is bounded, e.g. all parameters have to be positive. If in MCMC as proposal distribution I use normal distribution, then at some iterations I get negative proposals. So my question is: should I use recalculation of acceptance probability every time I reject the proposal (something like in delayed rejection method), or I have to use another proposal (like lognormal, truncated normal, etc.)?
  
The simplest solution is to just calculate p(theta)=0 for theta outside the legal region, thus reject those jumps.  This will work fine (just remember that when you reject, you have to stay at the last value for one more iteration), but if you’re doing these rejections all the time, you might want to reparameterize your space, for example using logs for positive parameters, logits for constrained parameters, and softmax for parameters that are constrained to sum to 1.</p><p>5 0.15622824 <a title="1287-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-26-Occam.html">1392 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-26-Occam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cosma Shalizi  and  Larry Wasserman  discuss some papers from a conference on Ockham’s Razor.  I don’t have anything new to add on this so let me link to  past blog entries  on the topic and repost the following  from 2004 :
  
A lot has been written in statistics about “parsimony”—that is, the desire to explain phenomena using fewer parameters–but I’ve never seen any good general justification for parsimony.  (I don’t count “Occam’s Razor,” or “Ockham’s Razor,” or whatever, as a justification.  You gotta do better than digging up a 700-year-old quote.)


Maybe it’s because I work in social science, but my feeling is:  if you can approximate reality with just a few parameters, fine.  If you can use more parameters to fold in more information, that’s even better.


In practice, I often use simple models—because they are less effort to fit and, especially, to understand.  But I don’t kid myself that they’re better than more complicated efforts!

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman  refers  to finite mixture models as “beasts” and  writes  jokes that they “should be avoided at all costs.”
 
I’ve thought a lot about mixture models, ever since using them in an  analysis  of voting patterns that was published in 1990.  First off, I’d like to say that our model was useful so I’d prefer not to pay the cost of avoiding it.  For a quick description of our mixture model and its context, see pp. 379-380 of my  article  in the Jim Berger volume).  Actually, our case was particularly difficult because we were not even fitting a mixture model to data, we were fitting it to latent data and using the model to perform partial pooling.  My difficulties in trying to fit this model inspired our discussion of mixture models in Bayesian Data Analysis (page 109 in the second edition, in the section on “Counterexamples to the theorems”).
 
I agree with Larry that if you’re fitting a mixture model, it’s good to be aware of the problems that arise if you try to estimate</p><p>3 0.81864262 <a title="1287-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-06-Quote_of_the_day.html">398 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-06-Quote of the day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Becky Passonneau and colleagues at the Center for Computational Learning Systems (CCLS) at Columbia have been working on a project for ConEd (New York’s major electric utility) to  rank structures based on vulnerability to secondary events  (e.g., transformer explosions, cable meltdowns, electrical fires).  They’ve been using the R implementation  BayesTree  of Chipman, George and McCulloch’s  Bayesian Additive Regression Trees  (BART).
 
BART is a Bayesian non-parametric method that is non-identifiable in two ways.  Firstly, it is an additive tree model with a fixed number of trees, the indexes of which aren’t identified (you get the same predictions in a model swapping the order of the trees).  This is the same kind of non-identifiability you get with any mixture model (additive or interpolated) with an exchangeable prior on the mixture components.  Secondly, the trees themselves have varying structure over samples in terms of number of nodes and their topology (depth, branching, etc</p><p>5 0.80301458 <a title="1287-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Unhappy_with_improvement_by_a_factor_of_10%5E29.html">160 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Unhappy with improvement by a factor of 10^29</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Hogg writes:
  
My (now deceased) collaborator and guru in all things inference, Sam Roweis, used to emphasize to me that we should evaluate models in the data space — not the parameter space — because models are always effectively “effective” and not really, fundamentally true. Or, in other words, models should be compared in the space of their predictions, not in the space of their parameters (the  parameters didn’t really “exist” at all for Sam).  In that spirit, when we estimate the effectiveness of a MCMC method or tuning — by autocorrelation time or ESJD or anything else — shouldn’t we be looking at the changes in the model predictions over time, rather than the changes in the parameters over time?  That is, the autocorrelation time should be the autocorrelation time in what the model (at the walker position) predicts for the data, and the ESJD should be the expected squared jump distance in what the model predicts for the data?  This might resolve the concern I expressed a</p><p>2 0.9354322 <a title="1287-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-20-WWJD%3F__U_can_find_out%21.html">479 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-20-WWJD?

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>3 0.92082185 <a title="1287-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-24-Why_it_doesn%E2%80%99t_make_sense_in_general_to_form_confidence_intervals_by_inverting_hypothesis_tests.html">1913 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-24-Why it doesn’t make sense in general to form confidence intervals by inverting hypothesis tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m reposing  this  classic from 2011 . . . Peter Bergman pointed me to  this discussion  from Cyrus of  a presentation  by Guido Imbens on design of randomized experiments.
 
Cyrus writes:
  
The standard analysis that Imbens proposes includes (1) a Fisher-type permutation test of the sharp null hypothesis–what Imbens referred to as “testing”–along with a (2) Neyman-type point estimate of the sample average treatment effect and confidence interval–what Imbens referred to as “estimation.” . . .


Imbens claimed that testing and estimation are separate enterprises with separate goals and that the two should not be confused. I [Cyrus] took it as a warning against proposals that use “inverted” tests in order to produce point estimates and confidence intervals. There is no reason that such confidence intervals will have accurate coverage except under rather dire assumptions, meaning that they are not “confidence intervals” in the way that we usually think of them.

<p>Introduction: Arnaud Trolle (no  relation ) writes:
  
I have a question about the interpretation of (non-)overlapping of 95% credibility intervals. In a Bayesian ANOVA (a within-subjects one), I computed 95% credibility intervals about the main effects of a factor. I’d like to compare two by two the main effects across the different conditions of the factor. Can I directly interpret the (non-)overlapping of these credibility intervals and make the following statements: “As the 95% credibility intervals do not overlap, both conditions have significantly different main effects” or conversely “As the 95% credibility intervals overlap, the main effects of both conditions are not significantly different, i.e. equivalent”? 
I heard that, in the case of classical confidence intervals, the second statement is false, but what happens when working within a Bayesian framework?
  
My reply:
 
I think it makes more sense to directly look at inference for the difference.  Also, your statements about equivalence</p><p>6 0.90446442 <a title="1287-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-11-Symptomatic_innumeracy.html">900 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-11-Symptomatic innumeracy</a></p>

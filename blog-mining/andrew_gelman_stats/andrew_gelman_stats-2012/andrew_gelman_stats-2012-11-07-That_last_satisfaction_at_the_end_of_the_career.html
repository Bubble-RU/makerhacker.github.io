<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  news article  by Eli Kintisch with the following wonderful quote:
  
Will Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who questions the consensus view on climate, thinks Mashey is a destructive force who uses “totalitarian tactics”–publishing damaging documents online, without peer review–to carry out personal vendettas.
  
I’ve never thought of uploading files as “totalitarian” but maybe they do things differently at Princeton.  I actually think of totalitarians as acting secretly–denunciations without evidence, midnight arrests, trials in undisclosed locations, and so forth.  Mashey’s practice of putting everything out in the open seems to me the opposite of totalitarian.
 
The article also reports that Edward Wegman’s lawyer said that Wegman “has never engaged in plagiarism.”  If I were the lawyer, I’d be pretty mad at Wegman at this point.  I can just imagine the conversation:

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>5 0.1681294 <a title="1568-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-08-Another_Wegman_plagiarism.html">751 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-08-Another Wegman plagiarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the time of our last  discussion , Edward Wegman, a statistics professor who has also worked for government research agencies, had been involved in three cases of plagiarism:  a report for the U.S. Congress on climate models, a paper on social networks, a paper on color graphics.
 
Each of the plagiarism stories was slightly different:  the congressional report involved the distorted copying of research by a scientist (Raymond Bradley) whose conclusions Wegman disagreed with, the social networks paper included copied material in its background section, and the color graphics paper included various bits and pieces by others that had been used in old lecture notes.
 
Since then, blogger Deep Climate has  uncovered  another plagiarized article by Wegman, this time an article in a 2005 volume on data mining and data visualization.  Deep Climate writes, “certain sections of Statistical Data Mining rely heavily on lightly edited portions on lectures from Wegman’s statistical data mining c</p><p>6 0.14983232 <a title="1568-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-03-Double_standard%3F__Plagiarizing_journos_get_slammed%2C_plagiarizing_profs_just_shrug_it_off.html">1442 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-03-Double standard?

<p>Introduction: A  correspondent  writes:
  
A brief update on the  Stapel scandal . It seems that the Dutch universities involved were really determined to get to the bottom of this. A first part of the outcomes of the investigations are online (in English).  Several “commissions” or “committees” (I guess no proper English but this is the way scandals are sorted out in Dutch politics too) were established to investigate the matter.


The first commission to report is the commissie Levelt:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/


The most interesting part is this I guess:  https://www.commissielevelt.nl/levelt-committee/fraud-determined/ 


This concerns only the articles investigated by that commission. The others (Noort and Drenth) are expected to report in the coming months.


I [the correspondent] feel sorry for Stapel, but the amount of fraud is sizeable. I like the way the universities handle this—especially that they are fairly transparent.
  
Interesting. This all seems like overkill given how obvio</p><p>4 0.85938025 <a title="1568-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-16-Another_day%2C_another_plagiarist.html">1266 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-16-Another day, another plagiarist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham.

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan sends along  this paper  by Domenico Giannone, Michele Lenza, and Giorgio Primiceri:
  
Vector autoregressions are flexible time series models that can capture complex dynamic interrelationships among macroeconomic variables. However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative priors, in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model towards a parsimonious naive benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical modeling. This approach is theoretically grounded, easy to implement, and greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well both in terms of out-of-sample forecastingâ&euro;&rdquo;as well as factor</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8986662 <a title="1568-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-That_last_satisfaction_at_the_end_of_the_career.html">1568 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-That last satisfaction at the end of the career</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just finished reading an amusing but somewhat disturbing  article  by Mark Singer, a reporter for the New Yorker who follows in that magazine’s tradition of writing about amiable frauds.  (For those who are keeping score at home, Singer employs a McKelway-style relaxed tolerance rather than Liebling-style pyrotechnics.)  Singer’s topic was a midwestern dentist named Kip Litton who fradulently invented a side career for himself as a sub-3-hour marathoner.  What was amazing was not so much that Litton lied about his accomplishments but, rather, the huge efforts that he undertook to support these lies.  He went to faraway cities to not run marathons.  He fabricated multiple personas on running message boards.  He even invented an entire marathon and made up a list of participants.
 
This got me thinking about Ed Wegman (sorry!), the statistician who got tangled in a  series of plagiarism scandals .  As with Litton, once Wegman was caught once, energetic people looked at the records and</p><p>3 0.88935518 <a title="1568-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-16-Groundhog_day_in_August%3F.html">913 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-16-Groundhog day in August?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Due to my similar interest in  plagiarism , I went to The Human Cultural and Social Landscape session. [The recipient of the American Statistical Association's Founders Award in 2002] gave the first talk in the session instead of Yasmin Said, which was modestly attended (20 or so people) and gave a sociology talk with no numbers — and no attribution to where these ideas (on Afghanistan culture) came from. Would it really have hurt to give the source of this? I’m on board with plain laziness for this one.


I think he may have mentioned a number of his collaborators at the beginning, and all he talked about were cultural customs and backgrounds, no science to speak of.
  
It’s kind of amazing to me that he actually showed up at JSM, but of course if he had any shame, he wouldn’t have repeatedly  stolen  copied without proper attribution in the first place.  It’s not even like Doris Kearns Goodwin who reportedly produced a well-written book out of it!</p><p>4 0.8872062 <a title="1568-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-%E2%80%9CIncome_can%E2%80%99t_be_used_to_predict_political_opinion%E2%80%9D.html">924 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-“Income can’t be used to predict political opinion”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What really irritates me about  this column  (by John Steele Gordon) is not how stupid it is (an article about “millionaires” that switches  within the very same paragraph  between “a nest egg of $1 million” and “a $1 million annual income” without acknowledging the difference between these concepts) or the ignorance it displays (no, it’s not true that “McCain carried the middle class” in 2008—unless by “middle class” you mean “middle class whites”).
 
No, what really ticks me off is that, when the Red State Blue State book was coming out, we pitched a “5 myths” article for the Washington Post, and they turned us down!  Perhaps the rule is:  if it’s in the Opinions section of the paper, it can’t contain any facts?  Or, to be more precise, any facts it contains must be counterbalanced by an equal number of inanities?

<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:

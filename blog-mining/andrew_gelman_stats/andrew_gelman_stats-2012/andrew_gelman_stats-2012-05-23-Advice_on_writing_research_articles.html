<p>Introduction: Basbøll  writes :
  
I [Basbøll] have got to come up with forty things to say [in the next few months]. . . .


What would you like me to write about?  I’ll of course be writing quite a bit about what I’m now calling “article design”, i.e., how to map out the roughly forty paragraphs that a journal article is composed of. And I’ll also be talking about how to plan the writing process that is to produce those paragraphs. The basic principle is still to write at least one paragraph a day in 27 minutes. (You can adapt this is various ways to your own taste; some like 18-minute or even 13-minute paragraphs.)


But I’d like to talk about questions of style, too, and even a little bit about epistemology. “Knowledge—academic knowledge, that is—is the ability to compose a coherent prose paragraph about something in 27 minutes,” I always say. I’d like to reflect a little more about what this conception of knowledge really means. This means I’ll have to walk back my recent dismissal of epistemol</p><p>5 0.13007246 <a title="1338-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-03-Suggested_reading_for_a_prospective_statistician%3F.html">316 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-03-Suggested reading for a prospective statistician?</a></p>

I am writing to ask you to recommend papers, books–anything that comes to mind that might give a prospective statistician some sense of what the future holds for statistics (and statisticians). I have a liberal arts background with an emphasis in mathematics. It seems like this is an exciting time to be a statistician, but that’s just from the outside looking in. I’m curious about your perspective on the future of the discipline.
  
Any recommendations?  My favorite is still the book, “Statistics:  A Guide to the Unknown,” first edition.  (I actually have a chapter in the latest (fourth) edition, but I think the first edition (from 1972, I believe) is still the best.</p><p>6 0.12788235 <a title="1338-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-25-The_problem_with_realistic_advice%3F.html">1428 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-25-The problem with realistic advice?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reading  this  amusing book review on willpower by Will Self ( link  from Jenny Davidson) reminds me that recently [actually, several months ago; recall that most of this blog is published on a delay], I felt frustrated that I wasn’t getting anything done.  I think that when I write this sort of thing it annoys people, because I’m lucky enough to be in a position to get a lot done—projects ranging from the ethics column to Stan—but I get frustrated when I spend a week trying to work, and then when the week’s over, I realize that all I did was respond to emails, review a bunch of journal submissions and grant proposals, and spend a lot of time staring into space while putting off whatever it was that I really thought I should be doing.
 
I thought and thought, and I decided that my best strategy is what I call  positive procrastination .  Procrastination is of course typically considered a bad thing (or, as ironic-style writers would write, a Bad Thing).

<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to.

I’m a graduate student in computational biology, and I’m relatively new to advanced statistics, and am trying to teach myself how best to approach a problem I have.


My dataset is a small sparse matrix of 150 cases and 70 predictors, it is sparse as in many zeros, not many ‘NA’s.  Each case is a nutrient that is fed into an in silico organism, and its response is whether or not it stimulates growth, and each predictor is one of 70 different pathways that the nutrient may or may not belong to.  Because all of the nutrients do not belong to all of the pathways, there are thus many zeros in my matrix.  My goal is to be able to use the pathways themselves to predict whether or not a nutrient could stimulate growth, thus I wanted to compute regression coefficients for each pathway, with which I could apply to other nutrients for other species.


There are quite a few singularities in the dataset (summary(glm) reports that 14 coefficients are not defined because of sin</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97508949 <a title="1338-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-23-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">1338 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-23-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  a few years ago :
  
Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend  rewriting both articles from scratch , using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.


4. Now go back and write the literature review</p><p>3 0.96961081 <a title="1338-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-21-If_a_lottery_is_encouraging_addictive_gambling%2C_don%E2%80%99t_expand_it%21.html">1731 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-21-If a lottery is encouraging addictive gambling, don’t expand it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>5 0.9630096 <a title="1338-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-12-The_Wald_method_has_been_the_subject_of_extensive_criticism_by_statisticians_for_exaggerating_results%E2%80%9D.html">410 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-12-The Wald method has been the subject of extensive criticism by statisticians for exaggerating results”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>6 0.96127176 <a title="1338-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-04-%E2%80%9CWho_owns_Congress%E2%80%9D.html">319 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-04-“Who owns Congress”</a></p>

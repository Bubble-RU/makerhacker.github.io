<p>Introduction: Nathan Roseberry writes:
  
I thought I had read on your blog that bar charts should always include zero on the scale, but a search of your blog (or google) didn’t return what I was looking for.  Is it considered a best practice to always include zero on the axis for bar charts?  Has this been written in a book?
  
My reply:
 
The idea is that the area of the bar represents “how many” or “how much.” The bar has to go down to 0 for that to work.  You don’t have to have your y-axis go to zero, but if you want the axis to go anywhere else, don’t use a bar graph, use a line graph.  Usually line graphs are better anyway.
 
I’m sure this is all in a book somewhere.</p><p>5 0.1457963 <a title="1498-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-30-A_tax_on_inequality%2C_or_a_tax_to_keep_inequality_at_the_current_level%3F.html">1145 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-30-A tax on inequality, or a tax to keep inequality at the current level?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My sometime coauthor Aaron Edlin cowrote (with Ian Ayres)  an op-ed  recommending a clever approach to taxing the rich.
 
In their article they employ a charming bit of economics jargon, using the word “earn” to mean “how much money you make.”  They “propose an automatic extra tax on the income of the top 1 percent of earners.”  I assume their tax would apply to unearned income as well, but they (or their editor at the Times) are just so used to describing income as “earnings” that they just threw that in.  Funny.
 
Also, there’s a part of the article that doesn’t make sense to me. 
   
Ayres and Edlin first describe the level of inequality:
  
In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.
  
Then they lay out their solution:

<p>Introduction: I continue to be the go-to guy for bad graphs.  Today (i.e., 22 Feb), I received an email from Gary Rosin:
  
I [Rosin] thought you might be interested in  this  graph showing the decline in median prices of homes since 1997. It exaggerates the  proportions by using $150,000 as the floor, rather than zero.
  
Indeed.  Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
A line plot, rather than a bar plot, would be appropriate here.  Also, it’s weird that the headline says “10 years” but the graph has only 6 years.  Why not give some perspective and show, say, 30 years?</p><p>4 0.7501424 <a title="1498-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-01-A_graph_at_war_with_its_caption.__Also%2C_how_to_visualize_the_same_numbers_without_giving_the_display_a_misleading_causal_feel%3F.html">1834 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-01-A graph at war with its caption.  Also, how to visualize the same numbers without giving the display a misleading causal feel?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  discusses  the following  graph  that is captioned, “A study of 54 nations–ranked below–found that those with more progressive tax rates had happier citizens, on average.”
 
   
 
As Kaiser writes, “from a purely graphical perspective, the chart is well executed . . . they have 54 points, and the chart still doesn’t look too crammed . . .”  But he also points out that the graph’s implicit claims (that tax rates can explain happiness or cause more happiness) are not supported.
 
Kaiser and I are not being picky-picky-picky here.  Taken literally, the graph title says nothing about causation, but I think the phrasing implies it.  Also, from a purely descriptive perspective, the graph is somewhat at war with its caption.  The caption announces a relationship, but in the graph, the x and y variables have only a very weak correlation.  The caption says that happiness and progressive tax rates go together, but the graph uses the U.S. as a baseline, and when you move from the U.S</p><p>5 0.73877841 <a title="1498-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-17-%28Worst%29_graph_of_the_year.html">915 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-17-(Worst) graph of the year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  (forwarded to me from Jeff, from a powerpoint by Willam Gawthrop) wins not on form but on content:
 
   
 
Really this graph should stand alone but it’s so wonderful that I can’t resist pointing out a few things: 
   
- The gap between 610 and 622 A.D. seems to be about the same as the previous 600 years, and only a little less than the 1400 years before that.
 
- “Pious and devout” Jews are portrayed as having steadily increased in nonviolence up to the present day.  Been to Israel lately?
 
- I assume the line labeled “Bible” is referring to Christians?  I’m sort of amazed to see pious and devout Christians listed as being maximally violent at the beginning.  Huh?  I thought Christ was supposed to be a nonviolent, mellow dude.  The line starts at 3 B.C., implying that  baby Jesus  was at the extreme of violence.
 
Gong forward, we can learn from the graph that pious and devout Christians in 1492 or 1618, say, were much more peaceful than Jesus and his crew.

<p>Introduction: I saw this graph  posted  by Tyler Cowen:
 
   
 
and my first thought was that the bar plot should be replaced by a line plot:  Six lines, one for each income category, with each line being a time series of these changes.  With a line plot, you can more easily see each time series (these are hard to see in the barplot because you have to follow each color and jump from decade to decade) and also compare the patterns for each category.  The line plot pretty much dominates the bar plot.
 
At least that was the theory.  Now here’s what actually happened.
 
I downloaded the data as Excel files, saved them as csv, then read them into R.  In all, it took close to an hour to get the data set up in the format that was needed to make the graphs.  At this point it was pretty easy to make the line plot.  But the result was disappointing:

<p>Introduction: Saw Argo the other day, was impressed by the way it was filmed in such a 70s style, sorta like that movie The Limey or an episode of the Rockford Files.
 
I also felt nostalgia for that relatively nonviolent era.  All those hostages and nobody was killed.  It’s a good thing the Ayatollah didn’t have some fundamentalist Shiite equivalent of John Yoo telling him to waterboard everybody.
 
At the time we were all so angry and upset about the hostage-taking, but from the perspective of our suicide-bomber era, that whole hostage episode seems so comfortingly mild.</p><p>3 0.76161915 <a title="1498-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-The_R_code_for_those_time-use_graphs.html">672 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-The R code for those time-use graphs</a></p>

I don’t know anything about the internet biz.  What I’m guessing is that they set up this cool website that is pretty much functional, with the goal of selling it for a few million dollars to Travelocity or Expedia or Kayak.  What I’m wondering is, why haven’t they made the deal already?  Hipmunk’s GUI is great.  The site is useless because it’s missing so many flights, but if you put it in an actual travel site such as Expedia, it would be great.

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Sam Behseta, the new editor of Chance magazine, asked me if I’d like to have a column.  I said yes, I’d like to write on ethics and statistics.  My  first column  was called “Open Data and Open Methods” and I discussed the ethical obligation to share data and make our computations transparent wherever possible.  In my column, I recounted a story from a bit over 20 years ago when I noticed a problem in a published analysis (involving electromagnetic fields and calcium flow in chicken brains) and contacted the researcher in charge of the study, who would not share his data with me.
 
Two of the people from that research team—biologist Carl Blackman and statistician Dennis House—saw my Chance column and felt that I had misrepresented the situation and had criticized them unfairly.
 
Blackman and House expressed their concerns in letters to the editor which were just published, along with my reply, in the latest issue of  Chance .

<p>Introduction: “Ethics and Statistics” is descriptive but boring.  It sounds like the textbook for a course which, unfortunately, nobody will take.
 
“Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics” is too unoriginal.
 
“How to Lie, Cheat, and Steal With Statistics” is kind of ok, maybe?
 
“Statistical Dilemmas”:  maybe a bit too boring as well.
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Statistics, and Some Guys Who’ve Skated a Bit Close to the Edge”:  Hmmm….
 
Maybe we have to get “statistics” out of the title altogether?
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Data Science”?
 
“Date Science and Data Fraud”?
 
“10 Things You Really Really Really Shouldn’t Do With Numbers”?
 
And, if no better idea comes along, there’s always “Evilicious:  Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad.”  (Regular readers will know what I’m talking about here; the rest of you can google it.)
 
Or maybe just “The Wegman Report”?
 
It’s  hard  to come up with a good title. Even  John Updike  had difficulties in this regard.

<p>Introduction: I happened to receive two questions about stopping rules on the same day.
 
First, from Tom Cunningham:
  
I’ve been arguing with my colleagues about whether the stopping rule is relevant (a presenter disclosed that he went out to collect more data because the first experiment didn’t get significant results) — and I believe you have some qualifications to the Bayesian irrelevance argument but I don’t properly understand them.
  
Then, from Benjamin Kay:
  
I have a question that may be of interest for your blog. I was reading about the early history of AIDS and learned that the the trial of AZT was ended early because it was  so effective :

 
The trial reported in the New England Journal of medicine, had produced a dramatic result. Before the planned 24 week duration of the study, after a mean period of participation of about 120 days, nineteen participants receiving placebo had died while there was only a single death among those receiving AZT.   This appeared to be a momentous break</p><p>6 0.1195683 <a title="1117-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-18-Experimenting_on_your_intro_stat_course%2C_as_a_way_of_teaching_experimentation_in_your_intro_stat_course_%28and_also_to_improve_the_course_itself%29.html">1268 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-18-Experimenting on your intro stat course, as a way of teaching experimentation in your intro stat course (and also to improve the course itself)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nick Rizzo  points  to  this  amusing Gawker item (sorry!) from Hamilton Nolan about advertisers trying to sneak links into blog content.  The Gawker blogger got the following email:
  
Greetings, 
My name is Bryan Clark, and I’m a big fan of your writing. I contacted you because I think I have a mutually beneficial agreement that will allow you to make additional money for articles you are already writing online. Let me give you an idea of how we can help each other. 
We’re looking for writers that can help increase the profile of our clients by linking to them within the context of their articles. The clients are huge, and we generally have one that can fit naturally in the context of most article niches. 
In return, we pay generously for a single link for our clients. 
If you are interested, I’d love to talk about it more.


Regards, 
Bryan Clark

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email:  
  
Howdy Andrew,


Hope you’re keeping well! I was wondering if you’re open to guest posts at Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science – if you are interested, I can offer an original 500-1000 word, very high quality article in fitting with the site. All research and writing will be carried out by a professional writer (namely, me) and once approved it will be entirely yours to place on the site as you see fit.


I can choose a title for the article or you can suggest one and I’ll work around that. Normally I write for property and travel sites (particularly cruise and ski related), but I’m game for anything if you’re happy to entertain me. I can also include some copyright-free and high quality pictures related to the blog post.


You’re probably wondering what’s in it for me, which is a fair question – in return, all I’d ask is a subtle link back in return. Other than that, the material itself would be non-commericial</p><p>4 0.71551234 <a title="1117-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians%3A_When_We_Teach%2C_We_Don%E2%80%99t_Practice_What_We_Preach.html">1237 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians: When We Teach, We Don’t Practice What We Preach</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From  a few years ago :
  
Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend  rewriting both articles from scratch , using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.


4. Now go back and write the literature review</p><p>6 0.70023572 <a title="1117-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-25-Spam%21.html">2148 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-25-Spam!</a></p>

I’m looking for your input!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve recently started a regular column on ethics, appearing every three months in  Chance magazine .  My first column, “Open Data and Open Methods,” is  here , and my second column, “Statisticians:  When we teach, we don’t practice what we preach” (coauthored with Eric Loken) will be appearing in the next issue.
 
Statistical ethics is a wide-open topic, and I’d be very interested in everyone’s thoughts, questions, and stories.  I’d like to get beyond generic questions such as, Is it right to do a randomized trial when you think the treatment is probably better than the control?, and I’d also like to avoid the really easy questions such as, Is it ethical to copy Wikipedia entries and then sell the resulting publication for  $2800  a year?  [Note to people who are sick of hearing about this particular story:  I'll consider stopping my blogging on it, the moment that the people involved consider apologizing for their behavior.]

<p>Introduction: Maximum likelihood gives the beat fit to the training data but in general overfits, yielding overly-noisy parameter estimates that don’t perform so well when predicting new data.  A popular solution to this overfitting problem takes advantage of the iterative nature of most maximum likelihood algorithms by stopping early.  In general, an iterative optimization algorithm goes from a starting point to the maximum of some objective function.  If the starting point has some good properties, then early stopping can work well, keeping some of the virtues of the starting point while respecting the data.  
 
This trick can be performed the other way, too, starting with the data and then processing it to move it toward a model.  That’s how the iterative proportional fitting algorithm of Deming and Stephan (1940) works to fit multivariate categorical data to known margins.
 
In any case, the trick is to stop at the right point–not so soon that you’re ignoring the data but not so late that you en</p><p>3 0.95541835 <a title="1117-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-27-%28R-Py-Cmd%29Stan_2.1.0.html">2150 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-27-(R-Py-Cmd)Stan 2.1.0</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’re happy to announce the release of Stan C++, CmdStan, 
RStan, and PyStan 2.1.0.  This is a minor feature release, 
but it is also an important bug fix release.  As always, the 
place to start is the (all new) Stan web pages:
 
 http://mc-stan.org 
 
 
 
 Major Bug in 2.0.0, 2.0.1 
 
Stan 2.0.0 and Stan 2.0.1 introduced a bug in the implementation 
of the NUTS criterion that led to poor tail exploration and 
thus biased the posterior uncertainty downward.  There was no 
bug in NUTS in Stan 1.3 or earlier, and 2.1 has been extensively tested 
and tests put in place so this problem will not recur.
 
If you are using Stan 2.0.0 or 2.0.1, you should switch to 2.1.0 as 
soon as possible and rerun any models you care about.
 
 
 
 New Target Acceptance Rate Default for Stan 2.1.0 
  Another big change aimed at reducing posterior estimation bias 
was an increase in the target acceptance rate during adaptation 
from 0.65 to 0.80.  The bad news is that iterations will take 
around 50% longer</p><p>4 0.95430177 <a title="1117-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-19-Revised_evidence_for_statistical_standards.html">2140 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-19-Revised evidence for statistical standards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: X  and I heard about  this  much-publicized recent paper by Val Johnson, who suggests changing the default level of statistical significance from z=2 to z=3 (or, as he puts it, going from p=.05 to p=.005 or .001).  Val argues that you need to go out to 3 standard errors to get a Bayes factor of 25 or 50 in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  I don’t really buy this, first because Val’s model is a weird (to me) mixture of two point masses, which he creates in order to make a minimax argument, and second because I don’t see why you need a Bayes factor of 25 to 50 in order to make a claim.  I’d think that a factor of 5:1, say, provides strong information already—if you really believe those odds.  The real issue, as I see it, is that we’re getting Bayes factors and posterior probabilities we don’t believe, because we’re assuming flat priors that don’t really make sense.  This is a topic that’s come up over and over in recent months on this blog, for example in this discussion of why I  d</p><p>5 0.95389646 <a title="1117-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-10-The_statistical_significance_filter.html">899 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-10-The statistical significance filter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>4 0.14741738 <a title="1122-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-06-How_to_think_about_papers_published_in_low-grade_journals%3F.html">1928 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-06-How to think about papers published in low-grade journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.  I commented as follows:
  
Read between the lines. The paper originally was released in 2009 and was published in 2013 in PLOS-One, which is one step above appearing on Arxiv.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>6 0.12233819 <a title="1122-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-26-The_reverse-journal-submission_system.html">1393 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-26-The reverse-journal-submission system</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  blog post  by Phil Davis on “the emergence of a citation cartel.”  Davis tells the story: 
  
  
Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived.

<p>Introduction: The Association for Psychological Science, the leading organization of research psychologists, announced a long-awaited new journal,  Speculations on Psychological Science .  From the official APS press release:
  
Speculations on Psychological Science, the flagship journal of the Association for Psychological Science, will publish cutting-edge research articles, short reports, and research reports spanning the entire spectrum of the science of psychology. We anticipate that Speculations on Psychological Science will be the highest ranked empirical journal in psychology. We recognize that many of the most noteworthy published claims in psychology and related fields are not well supported by data, hence the need for a journal for the publication of such exciting speculations without misleading claims of certainty.

<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>6 0.83579302 <a title="1122-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-14-A_model_rejection_letter.html">1118 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-14-A model rejection letter</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  writes :
  
As long as a journal pursues a strategy of publishing “wow” studies, it will inevitably contain more unreplicable findings and unsupportable conclusions than equally rigorous but more “boring” journals. Groundbreaking will always be higher-risk. And definitive will be the territory of journals that publish meta-analyses and reviews. . . .


Most conclusions, even those in peer-reviewed papers in rigorous journals, should be regarded as tentative at best; but press releases and other public communication rarely convey that. . . .
  
His message to all of us:
  
Our standard response to a paper in Science, Nature, or Psychological Science should be “wow, that’ll be really interesting if it replicates.” And in our teaching and our engagement with the press and public, we need to make clear why that is the most enthusiastic response we can justify.</p><p>2 0.8978315 <a title="1122-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-17-The_Washington_Post_reprints_university_press_releases_without_editing_them.html">2215 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-17-The Washington Post reprints university press releases without editing them</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .  But I wonder how the profs in the psych d</p><p>3 0.86865795 <a title="1122-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-10-Hey%2C_where%E2%80%99s_my_kickback%3F.html">78 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-10-Hey, where’s my kickback?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I keep hearing about textbook publishers who practically bribe instructors to assign their textbooks to students.  And then I received this (unsolicited) email:
  
 
You have recently been sent Pearson (Allyn & Bacon, Longman, Prentice Hall) texts to review for your summer and fall courses.  As a thank you for reviewing our texts, I would like to invite you to participate in a brief survey (attached).


If you have any questions about the survey, are not sure which books you have been sent, or if you would like to receive instructor’s materials, desk copies, etc. please let me know!  If you have recently received your course assignments – let me know as well .


Additionally, if you have decided to use a Pearson book in your summer or fall courses, I will provide you with an ISBN that will include discounts and resources for your students at no extra cost!


All you have to do is answer the 3 simple questions on the attached survey and you will receive a $10.00 Dunkin Donuts gift card.</p><p>4 0.84192002 <a title="1122-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Alfred_Kahn.html">487 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Alfred Kahn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Appointed “inflation czar” in late 1970s, Alfred Kahn is  most famous  for deregulating the airline industry.  At the time this seemed to make sense, although in retrospect I’m less a fan of consumer-driven policies than I used to be.  When I was a kid we subscribed to Consumer Reports and so I just assumed that everything that was good for the consumer–lower prices, better products, etc.–was a good thing.  Upon reflection, though, I think it’s a mistake to focus too narrowly on the interests of consumers.  For example (from  my Taleb review  a couple years ago):
  
The discussion on page 112 of how Ralph Nader saved lives (mostly via seat belts in cars) reminds me of his car-bumper campaign in the 1970s. My dad subscribed to Consumer Reports then (he still does, actually, and I think reads it for pleasure–it must be one of those Depression-mentality things), and at one point they were pushing heavily for the 5-mph bumpers. Apparently there was some federal regulation about how strong</p><p>5 0.81685317 <a title="1122-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-20-The_candy_weighing_demonstration%2C_or%2C_the_unwisdom_of_crowds.html">2257 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-20-The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From 2008:
  
 The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds 


My favorite statistics demonstration is the one with the bag of candies. I’ve elaborated upon it since including it in  the Teaching Statistics book  and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.


 Preparation 


Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it’s exactly 100.


You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.


Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.


 Setup

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>4 0.10277798 <a title="1591-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Popular_governor%2C_small_state.html">159 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Popular governor, small state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, upon the selection of Sarah Palin as vice-presidential nominee, I made some graphs of the popularity of governors of different-sized states:
 
 
 
As I wrote  at the time :
 
It seems to be easier to maintain high approval in a small state. What’s going on? Some theories: in a large state, there will be more ambitious politicians on the other side, eager to knock off the incumbent governor; small states often have part-time legislatures and thus the governor is involved in less political conflict; small states (notably Alaska) tend to get more funds per capita from the federal government, and it’s easier to be popular when you can disburse more funds; large states tend to be more heterogeneous and so it’s harder to keep all the voters happy.
 
I was curious how things have been going more recently, and Hanfei made an updated graph using data from  this archive .  Here’s the story:

<p>Introduction: This American Life  reporter Gabriel Rhodes  says :
  
This is one of the big differences between Jon and Anthony, between scientist and non-scientist. For Jon, having a year’s worth of work suddenly thrown into question is a normal day at the office. But for Anthony, that’s not normal. And it’s not OK. The time in Jon’s lab was a year of his life, where he felt like Jon kept moving the goal posts. . . . But now, Anthony wants to know, before he starts turning his life upside down again, what will count as proof enough for Jon? How many experiments?

 
Anthony Holland:  So let’s say I do three weeks of experiment, and I only concentrate on these leukemia cells. And if I can kill at least 20% every single time, every week, will that do it? Would that be enough? Or do you want to see pancreatic die, or do you want to see—I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?
 
  
This captures a big problem with the research enterprise, as I see it.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.
 
I’m reminded of a bizarrely-retro  remark  from a couple years ago by Colin (“at age 22″) Camerer.  In response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer said:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”

<p>Introduction: Philip Cohen  asks , “Why are mothers becoming moms?”  These aren’t just two words for the same thing:  in political terms “mother” is merely descriptive while “mom” is more positive.  Indeed, we speak of “mom and apple pie” as unquestionable American icons.
 
Cohen points out that motherhood is sometimes but not always respected in political discourse:
  
On the one hand, both President Obama and pundit Hilary Rosen have now called motherhood the world’s hardest job. And with the Romneys flopping onto the all-mothers-work bandwagon, it appears we’re reaching a rare rhetorical consensus.


On the other hand, the majority in both major political parties agrees that poor single mothers and their children need one thing above all – a (real) job, one that provides the “dignity of an honest day’s work.” For welfare purposes, taking care of children is not only not the toughest job in the world, it is more akin to nothing at all. When Bill Clinton’s endorsed welfare-to-work he famously decla</p><p>4 0.71142292 <a title="1591-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Life_in_New_York%2C_Then_and_Now.html">139 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Life in New York, Then and Now</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school.

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . .

<p>Introduction: Reading  these  news articles that slam more and more nails into the (perhaps unfairly) already-dead reputation of Hewlett Packard executive Meg Whitman, I keep thinking:  what if she’d won her election a couple years ago and was now governor or senator or whatever she was running for?  Then nobody would care that her company was falling apart!
 
Conversely, when Jon Corzine lost his reelection and reentered the business world, he left himself open to charges of acts of corruption that wouldn’t have been possible in congress or from the governor’s office.
 
But sometimes the immunity can go the other way.  Jack Welch still has the street-cred to  write  Wall Street Journal editorials despite his  history  of data manipulation, but it’s hard to imagine he could be elected to public office, even if he wanted to.  For another example, Al Sharpton was caught out on his lies in a well-publicized court case but that does not stop him from being bankrolled as a quasi-public figure.

<p>Introduction: False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant 
  
[I]t is unacceptably easy to publish “statistically significant” evidence consistent with any hypothesis.


The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?


It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields “statistical significance,” and to then report only what “worked.” The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at leas</p><p>3 0.94848984 <a title="1591-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-John_McAfee_is_a_Heinlein_hero.html">1616 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-John McAfee is a Heinlein hero</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “A small group of mathematicians” 
 
Jenny Davidson  points  to  this  article by Krugman on Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy.  Given the silliness of the topic, Krugman’s piece is disappointingly serious (“Maybe the first thing to say about Foundation is that it’s not exactly science fiction – not really. Yes, it’s set in the future, there’s interstellar travel, people shoot each other with blasters instead of pistols and so on. But these are superficial details . . . the story can sound arid and didactic. . . . you’ll also be disappointed if you’re looking for shoot-em-up action scenes, in which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star in the nick of time. . . .”).  What really jumped out at me from Krugman’s piece, though, was this line:
  
In Foundation, we learn that a small group of mathematicians have developed “psychohistory”, the aforementioned rigorous science of society.
  
Like Davidson (and Krugman), I read the Foundation books as a child.

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

<p>Introduction: Raghuveer Parthasarathy pointed me to an article in Nature by Mina Bissell, who  writes , “The push to replicate findings could shelve promising research and unfairly damage the reputations of careful, meticulous scientists.”
 
I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

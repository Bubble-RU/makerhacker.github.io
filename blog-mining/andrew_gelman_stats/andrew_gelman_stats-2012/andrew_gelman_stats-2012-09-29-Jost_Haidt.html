<p>Introduction: In a review of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” William Saletan  writes :
  
You’re smart. You’re liberal. You’re well informed. You think conservatives are narrow-minded. You can’t understand why working-class Americans vote Republican. You figure they’re being duped. You’re wrong. . . .


Haidt diverges from other psychologists who have analyzed the left’s electoral failures. The usual argument of these psycho-­pundits is that conservative politicians manipulate voters’ neural roots — playing on our craving for authority, for example — to trick people into voting against their interests. But Haidt treats electoral success as a kind of evolutionary fitness test. He figures that if voters like Republican messages, there’s something in Republican messages worth liking. He chides psychologists who try to “explain away” conservatism, treating it as a pathology. Conservatism thrives because it fits how people think, and that’s what validates it.

<p>Introduction: Stephen Olivier points me to this horrible, horrible  news article  by Jonathan Haidt, “Why working-class people vote conservative”:
  
Across the world, blue-collar voters ally themselves with the political right . . . Why on Earth would a working-class person ever vote for a conservative candidate? This question has obsessed the American left since Ronald Reagan first captured the votes of so many union members, farmers, urban Catholics and other relatively powerless people – the so-called “Reagan Democrats”. . . .
  
Sorry, but no no no no no.  Where to start?
 
Here’s the difference between upper-income and lower-income votes in presidential elections:
 
   
 
Ronald Reagan did about 20 percentage points better among voters in the upper third of income, compared to voters in the lower third.  The relation between income and voting since 1980 is about the same as it was in the 1940s.
 
Oh yeah, Haidt said something about “across the world.”  How bout this:
 
   
 
It varies.  In mos</p><p>4 0.30387443 <a title="1515-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-04-%E2%80%9CSocial_Psychologists_Detect_Liberal_Bias_Within%E2%80%9D.html">600 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-04-“Social Psychologists Detect Liberal Bias Within”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko asks what I think of  this  news article by John Tierney.  The article’s webpage is given the strange incomplete title above.
 
My first comment is that the headline appears false.  I didn’t see any evidence presented of liberal bias. (If the headline says “Social psychologists detect,” I expect to see some detection, not just anecdotes.) What I did see was a discussion of the fact that most academic psychologists consider themselves politically liberal (a pattern that holds for academic researchers in general), along with some anecdotes of moderates over the years who have felt their political views disrespected by the liberal majority.
  

 
I’m interested in the topic, and I’m open to the possibility that there are all sorts of biases in academic research–but I don’t see the evidence from this article that social psychologists have detected any bias yet.  Phrases such as “a statistically impossible lack of diversity” are just silly.
 
What I really wonder is what  John Jo</p><p>5 0.29884812 <a title="1515-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-08-More_on_the_missing_conservative_psychology_researchers.html">604 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-08-More on the missing conservative psychology researchers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Will Wilkinson  adds  to the discussion of Jonathan Haidt’s  remarks  regarding the overwhelming prevalance of liberal or left-wing attitudes among psychology professors.  I pretty much agree with Wilkinson’s overview:
  
Folks who constantly agree with one another grow insular, self-congratulatory, and not a little lazy. The very possibility of disagreement starts to seem weird or crazy. When you’re trying to do science about human beings, this attitude’s not so great.
  
Wilkinson also reviewed the work of  John Jost  in this area.  Jost is a psychology researcher with the expected liberal/left political leanings, but his relevance here is that he has actually done research on political attitudes and personality types.  In Wilkinson’s words:
  
Jost has done plenty of great work that helps explain not only why the best minds in science are liberal, but why most scientists-most academics, even-are liberal. Individuals with the personality trait that most strongly predicts an inclinati</p><p>6 0.25752386 <a title="1515-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive_psychology_research_helps_us_understand_confusion_of_Jonathan_Haidt_and_others_about_working-class_voters.html">1373 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive psychology research helps us understand confusion of Jonathan Haidt and others about working-class voters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Psychology is a universal science of human nature, whereas political science is centered on the study of particular historical events and trends.  Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that when a psychologist looks at politics, he presents ideas that are thought-provoking but are too general to quite work.  This is fine; political scientists can then take such ideas and try to adapt them more closely to particular circumstances.
 
The psychologist I’m thinking about here is Steven Pinker, who, in  writes  the following on the question, “Why Are States So Red and Blue?”:
  
But why do ideology and geography cluster so predictably? Why, if you know a person’s position on gay marriage, can you predict that he or she will want to increase the military budget and decrease the tax rate . . . there may also be coherent mindsets beneath the diverse opinions that hang together in right-wing and left-wing belief systems.

<p>Introduction: Delia Baldassarri and Amir Goldberg  write :
  
Americans’ political beliefs present a long observed paradox. Whereas the mainstream political discourse is structured on a clearly defined polarity between conservative and liberal views, in practice, most people exhibit ideologically incoherent belief patterns. This paper challenges the notion that political beliefs are necessarily defined by a singular ideological continuum. It applies a new, network-based method for detecting heterogeneity in collective patterns of opinion, relational class analysis (RCA), to Americans’ political attitudes as captured by the American National Election Studies. By refraining from making a-priori assumptions about how beliefs are interconnected, RCA looks for opinion structures, belief networks, that are not necessarily congruent with received wisdom. It finds that in the twenty years between 1984 and 2004 Americans’ political attitudes were consistently structured by two alternative belief systems: one</p><p>4 0.75322783 <a title="1515-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-15-Charles_Murray_on_the_new_upper_class.html">1169 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-15-Charles Murray on the new upper class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I posted  some comments  on the voting patterns of rich and poor in the context of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart.”  My graphs on income and voting are just fine, but I mischaracterized Murray’s statements.  So I want to fix that right away.  After that I have some thoughts on the book itself.

2. Murray talks a lot about upper-class liberals. That’s fine but I think his discussion would be improved by also considering upper-class conservatives, given that I see the big culture war occurring within the upper class.
 
3. Using the case of Joe Paterno as an example, I discuss why Murray’s “preach what you practice” advice could be difficult to carry out in practice. 
   
 Murray on the top 5% 
 
David Frum  quoted  Murray as writing that the top 5% “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it. Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”  In response, Frum and I both pointed out t</p><p>5 0.75113642 <a title="1515-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-04-%E2%80%9CSocial_Psychologists_Detect_Liberal_Bias_Within%E2%80%9D.html">600 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-04-“Social Psychologists Detect Liberal Bias Within”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko asks what I think of  this  news article by John Tierney.  The article’s webpage is given the strange incomplete title above.
 
My first comment is that the headline appears false.  I didn’t see any evidence presented of liberal bias. (If the headline says “Social psychologists detect,” I expect to see some detection, not just anecdotes.) What I did see was a discussion of the fact that most academic psychologists consider themselves politically liberal (a pattern that holds for academic researchers in general), along with some anecdotes of moderates over the years who have felt their political views disrespected by the liberal majority.
  

 
I’m interested in the topic, and I’m open to the possibility that there are all sorts of biases in academic research–but I don’t see the evidence from this article that social psychologists have detected any bias yet.  Phrases such as “a statistically impossible lack of diversity” are just silly.

<p>Introduction: Frank Hansen writes:
  
Columbus Park is on Chicago’s west side, in the Austin neighborhood. The park is a big green area which includes a golf course.


 Here  is the google satellite view.


 Here  is the nytimes page.  Go to Chicago, and zoom over to the census tract 2521, which is just north of the horizontal gray line (Eisenhower Expressway, aka I290) and just east of Oak Park. The park is labeled on the nytimes map.


The census data have around 50 dots (they say 50 people per dot) in the park which has no residential buildings.


Congressional district is Danny Davis, IL7.   Here’s  a map of the district.


So, how do we explain the map showing ~50 dots worth of people living in the park. What’s up with the algorithm to place the dots?

<p>Introduction: Research psychologist John Jost  reviews  the recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” by research psychologist Jonathan Haidt.  Some of my thoughts on Haidt’s book are  here .  And here’s some of Jost’s review:
  
Haidt’s book is creative, interesting, and provocative. . . . The book shines a new light on moral psychology and presents a bold, confrontational message. From a scientific perspective, however, I worry that his theory raises more questions than it answers. Why do some individuals feel that it is morally good (or necessary) to obey authority, favor the ingroup, and maintain purity, whereas others are skeptical? (Perhaps parenting style is relevant after all.) Why do some people think that it is morally acceptable to judge or even mistreat others such as gay or lesbian couples or, only a generation ago, interracial couples because they dislike or feel disgusted by them, whereas others do not? Why does the present generation “care about violence toward many more classes of victims</p><p>4 0.87864125 <a title="1515-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-DBQQ_rounding_for_labeling_charts_and_communicating_tolerances.html">939 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-DBQQ rounding for labeling charts and communicating tolerances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a mini research note, not deserving of a paper, but perhaps useful to others. It reinvents what has already  appeared  on this blog.
 
Let’s say we have a line chart with numbers between 152.134 and 210.823, with the mean of 183.463. How should we label the chart with about 3 tics? Perhaps 152.132, 181.4785 and 210.823? Don’t do it!
 
Objective is to fit about 3-7 tics at the optimal level of rounding. I use the following sequence:
  
  decimal rounding : fitting integer  power  and single-digit decimal  i , rounding to  i  * 10^ power  (example: 100 200 300) 
  binary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and binary  b , rounding to 2* i /(1+ b ) * 10^ power  (150 200 250) 
 (optional)  quaternary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and  quaternary  q  (0,1,2,3) round to 4* i /(1+ q ) * 10^ power  (150 175 200) 
  quinary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and  quinary  f  (0,1,2,3,4) round to 5* i /(1+ f ) * 10^ power  (160 180 200)</p><p>5 0.86708236 <a title="1515-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-08-How_adoption_speed_affects_the_abandonment_of_cultural_tastes.html">845 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-08-How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  article  by Jonah Berger and Gael Le Mens:
  
Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-r</p><p>6 0.85230803 <a title="1515-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-14-Cool-ass_signal_processing_using_Gaussian_processes_%28birthdays_again%29.html">1379 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-14-Cool-ass signal processing using Gaussian processes (birthdays again)</a></p>

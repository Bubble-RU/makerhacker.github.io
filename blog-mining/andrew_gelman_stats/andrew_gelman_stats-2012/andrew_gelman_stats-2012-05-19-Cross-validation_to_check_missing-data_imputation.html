My research group is increasingly focusing on a series of problems that involve data that either have missingness or measurements that may have bias/error.  We have at times developed our own approaches to imputation (as simple as interpolating a missing unit and as sophisticated as a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model) and at other times, other groups impute the data. 


The outputs are being used to investigate the basic associations between pairs of variables, Xs and Ys, in regressions; we may or may not interpret these as causal.  I am contacting colleagues with relevant expertise to suggest good references on whether having imputed X and/or Y in a subsequent regression is correct or if it could somehow lead to biased/spurious associations.   Thinking about this, we can have at least the following situations (these could all be Bayesian or not):

<p>Introduction: 15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well. Come up with a scheme for inverse-probability weights (ignoring nonresponse and assuming there is exactly one phone line per household).

I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>4 0.71473426 <a title="1330-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-18-Check_your_missing-data_imputations_using_cross-validation.html">1218 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-18-Check your missing-data imputations using cross-validation</a></p>

I am currently using the iterative regression imputation model as implemented in the Stata ICE package. I am using data from a survey of about 90,000 students in 142 schools and my variable of interest is parent level of education. I want only this variable to be imputed with as little bias as possible as I am not using any other variable. So I scoured the survey for every variable I thought could possibly predict parent education. The main variable I found is parent occupation, which explains about 35% of the variance in parent education for the students with complete data on both. I then include the 20 other variables I found in the survey in a regression predicting parent education, which explains about 40% of the variance in parent education for students with complete data on all the variables.

In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution?

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>3 0.98616213 <a title="1330-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Where_are_the_larger-than-life_athletes%3F.html">1115 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Where are the larger-than-life athletes?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.  I supp</p><p>4 0.9829337 <a title="1330-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-Elevator_shame_is_a_two-way_street.html">528 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-Elevator shame is a two-way street</a></p>

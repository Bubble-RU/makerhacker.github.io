<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: Mandelbrot on taxonomy  (from 1955; the first publication about fractals that I know of):
 
   
 
 Searching  for Mandelbrot on the blog led me to  Akaike , who also recently passed away and also did interesting early work on self-similar stochastic processes. 
 
For example, this wonderful opening of his 1962 paper, “On a limiting process which asymptotically produces f^{-2} spectral density”:
  
In the recent papers in which the results of the spectral analyses of roughnesses of runways or roadways are reported, the power spectral densities of approximately the form f^{-2} (f: frequency) are often treated. This fact directed the present author to the investigation of the limiting process which will provide the f^{-2} form under fairly general assumptions. In this paper a very simple model is given which explains a way how the f^{-2} form is obtained asymptotically. Our fundamental model is that the stochastic process, which might be considered to represent the roughness of the runway</p><p>4 0.084387258 <a title="1592-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-Elevator_shame_is_a_two-way_street.html">528 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-Elevator shame is a two-way street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  a  blog  by Samuel Arbesman mocking people who are so lazy that they take the elevator from 1 to 2.

<p>Introduction: I have agreed to do a local art exhibition in February. 
 
An excuse to think about form, colour and style for plotting almost individual observation likelihoods – while invoking the artists privilege of refusing to give interpretations of their own work.
 
In order to make it possibly less dry I’ll try to use intuitive suggestive captions like in this example  TheTyranyof13.pdf 
 
thereby side stepping the technical discussions like here  RadfordNealBlog 
 
Suggested models and data sets (or even submissions) would be most appreciated.
 
I likely be sticking to realism i.e. plots that represent ‘statistical reality’ faithfully.

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Chris Wiggins writes of an interesting-looking summer program that undergraduate or graduate students can apply to:
  
The hackNY Fellows program is an initiative to mentor the next generation of technology innovators in New York, focusing on tech startups. Last summer’s  class of fellows  was paired with NYC startups which demonstrated they could provide a mentoring environment (a clear project, a person who could work with the Fellow, and sufficient stability to commit to 10 weeks of compensation for the Fellow).  hackNY, with the support of the Kauffman foundation and the Internet Society of New York, provided shared housing in NYU dorms in Union Square, and organized a series of pedagogical lectures. 


hackNY was founded by Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly, Evan Korth, professor of CS at NYU, and Chris Wiggins, professor of applied mathematics at Columbia.

Drawing from My Mind’s Eye: 
Dorothea Rockburne in Conversation with David Cohen 
Introduced by Nina Samuel
 
Thursday, November 29 
6 pm 
BGC, 38 West 86th Street
 
Benoît Mandelbrot, unusual among mathematicians of the twentieth century, harnessed the power of visual images to express his theories and to pursue new lines of thought. In this conversation artist Dorothea Rockburne will share memories of studying with mathematician Max Dehn at Black Mountain College, of meeting Mandelbrot, and discuss her recent work.
 
Exhibition curator Nina Samuel will discuss the related exhibition “The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking,” on view in the BGC Focus Gallery through January 27, 2013.
 
  
   
David Cohen is editor and publisher of artcritical.com as well as founder and moderator of The Review Panel.

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>5 0.70733881 <a title="1592-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Non-statistical_thinking_in_the_US_foreign_policy_establishment.html">721 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Non-statistical thinking in the US foreign policy establishment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a few weeks behind in my New Yorker reading and so just recently read  this fascinating article  by Ryan Lizza on the current administration’s foreign policy.  He gives some insights into the transformation Obama from antiwar candidate to a president conducting three wars.
 
Speaking as a statistician, though, what grabbed my eye was a doctrine of journalist/professor/policymaker Samantha Power.  Lizza writes:
  
In 2002, after graduating from Harvard Law School, she wrote “A Problem from Hell,” which surveyed the grim history of six genocides committed in the twentieth century. Propounding a liberal-interventionist view, Power argued that “mass killing” on the scale of Rwanda or Bosnia must be prevented by other nations, including the United States. She wrote that America and its allies rarely have perfect information about when a regime is about to commit genocide; a President, therefore, must have “a bias toward belief” that massacres are imminent.

<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>3 0.1070134 <a title="1617-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-02-I_just_flew_in_from_the_econ_seminar%2C_and_boy_are_my_arms_tired.html">1039 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-02-I just flew in from the econ seminar, and boy are my arms tired</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve heard all sorts of scare stories of what it’s like to speak in an academic economics seminar:  they’re rude, they interrupt constantly, they don’t let you get through three slides in an hour, etc.  But whenever I’ve actually spoke in an economics department, the people have been polite and well-behaved, really it’s been like any other seminar. 
   
I mentioned this to some people awhile ago and they said that the nasty-economist thing only happens in the top departments.  I’d spoken at Columbia (which, if not at the very top, is still respectable), but that was in the political economy seminar and I’m a political scientist, so maybe they were nice to me because I’m local.  And the other econ departments where I’d spoken were in Europe (maybe they’re nicer there) or at non-elite institutions in the U.S.  So I called my friend at Harvard econ, told him my story, and asked if I could speak there.  He duly booked me for the Harvard-MIT econometrics seminar.
 
I  spoke  at the seminar,</p><p>4 0.090480357 <a title="1617-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-09-%EF%BF%BCLittle_Data%3A_How_traditional_statistical_ideas_remain_relevant_in_a_big-data_world.html">1526 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-09-￼Little Data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big-data world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: See if you can interpolate the talk from the  slides .
 
The background is:  I was invited to speak in this seminar on “big data.”  I said I didn’t know anything about big data, I worked on little data.  They said that was ok.  Actually it was probably a crowd-pleasing move to tell these people that little-data ideas remain relevant.</p><p>5 0.08921288 <a title="1617-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-06-Another_stereotype_demolished.html">699 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-06-Another stereotype demolished</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.  But still.</p><p>6 0.084824905 <a title="1617-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I gave  this talk  the other day and afterwards, a white guy came up to me and said he thought it was no coincidence that the researcher who made the mistake was “Oriental.”  He then went on for about 5 minutes explaining his theory.

<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>6 0.50949901 <a title="1617-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-12-The_Naval_Research_Lab.html">1261 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-12-The Naval Research Lab</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Goodman  gave the  departmental seminar  yesterday (10 Dec 2012) and I was amused by an extended analogy he made.  After his (very clear) intro, he said that math talks were like action movies.  The overall theorem and its applications provide the plot, and the proofs provide the action scenes.</p><p>3 0.90184498 <a title="1617-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-20-Stan%3A_A_%28Bayesian%29_Directed_Graphical_Model_Compiler.html">1131 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-20-Stan: A (Bayesian) Directed Graphical Model Compiler</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>5 0.79703385 <a title="1617-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-13-Against_the_myth_of_the_heroic_visualization.html">1896 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-13-Against the myth of the heroic visualization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.

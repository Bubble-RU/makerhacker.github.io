<p>Introduction: This entry was posted by Phil Price. 
 
	A colleague is looking at data on car (and SUV and light truck) collisions and casualties.  He’s interested in causal relationships.  For instance, suppose car manufacturers try to improve gas mileage without decreasing acceleration.  The most likely way they will do that is to make cars lighter.  But perhaps lighter cars are more dangerous; how many more people will die for each mpg increase in gas mileage?
 
	There are a few different data sources, all of them seriously deficient from the standpoint of answering this question.  Deaths are very well reported, so if someone dies in an auto accident you can find out what kind of car they were in, what other kinds of cars (if any) were involved in the accident, whether the person was a driver or passenger, and so on.  But it’s hard to normalize:  OK, I know that N people who were passengers in a particular model of car died in car accidents last year, but I don’t know how many passenger-miles that</p><p>3 0.17216091 <a title="1417-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Baby_name_wizards.html">720 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Baby name wizards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I noticed a car with the improbable name of Nissan Rogue, from Darien, Connecticut (at least that’s what the license plate frame said).  And, after all, what could be more “rogue”-like than a suburban SUV?
 
I can’t blame the driver of the car for this one; I’m just amused that the marketers and Nissan thought this was an appropriate name for the car.</p><p>4 0.14774296 <a title="1417-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Illinois. . . . My main work is in supply chain area, and empirical in nature. . . . I am working with a firm that has two separate divisions – one making cars, and the other makes trucks. Four years back, the firm made an interesting organizational change. They created a separate group of ~25 engineers, in their car division (from within their quality and production engineers). This group was focused on improving supplier quality and reported to car plant head . The truck division did not (and still does not) have such an independent “supplier improvement group”. Other than this unit in car, the organizational arrangements in the two divisions mimic each other.  There are many common suppliers to the car and truck division.


Data on quality of components coming from suppliers has been collected (for the last four years). The organizational change happened in January 2007.

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?  From the article:  “A money-laundering indictment, or a guilt</p><p>3 0.79357016 <a title="1417-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-The_Great_Race.html">1831 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-The Great Race</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Last summer my wife and I took a 3.5-month vacation that included a wide range of activities. When I got back, people would ask “what were the highlights or your trip?”, and I was somewhat at a loss: we had done so many things that were so different, many of which seemed really great…how could I pick? Someone said, wisely, that in six months or a year I’d be able to answer the question because some memories would be more vivid than others. They were right, and I was recently thinking back on our vacation and putting together a list of highlights — enjoyable in itself, but also worth doing to help plan future vacations.
 
One of the things we did was go to four evenings of track and field events at the London Olympics. After we got back, people would ask what we had seen at the Olympics. I would say “We saw Usain Bolt run the 200m, we saw the women’s 4x100m relay and the men’s 4×400, we saw the last events of the decathlon…lots of great stuff. But my favorite was</p><p>4 0.78544605 <a title="1417-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-05-Racism%21.html">321 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-05-Racism!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last night I spoke at the Columbia Club of New York, along with some of my political science colleagues, in a  panel  about politics, the economy, and the forthcoming election.  The discussion was fine . . . until one guy in the audience accused us of bias based on what he imputed as our ethnicity.  One of the panelists replied by asking the questioner what of all the things we had said was biased, and the questioner couldn’t actually supply any examples.
 
It makes sense that the questioner couldn’t come up with a single example of bias on our part, considering that we were actually presenting  facts .
 
At some level, the questioner’s imputation of our ethnicity and accusation of bias isn’t so horrible.  When talking with my friends, I engage in casual ethnic stereotyping all the time–hey, it’s a free country!–and one can certainly make the  statistical  argument that you can guess people’s ethnicities from their names, appearance, and speech patterns, and in turn you can infer a lot</p><p>5 0.78478152 <a title="1417-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>2 0.96491086 <a title="1417-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-22-Picking_pennies_in_front_of_a_steamroller%3A__A_parable_comes_to_life.html">2259 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-22-Picking pennies in front of a steamroller:  A parable comes to life</a></p>

 Chapter 1 


On Sunday we were over on 125 St so I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Jesus Taco was next door so I went there instead.  What a mistake!  I don’t know what Masanao and Yu-Sung could’ve been thinking.  Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn’t impress me).  I’m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I’m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn’t tell anyone.  I can’t really figure out why I’m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.  It’s a good deal:  they’re small but not that small.  Sure, I ate 6 of them, but I was h</p><p>3 0.95530736 <a title="1417-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-12-Picking_pennies_in_front_of_a_steamroller%3A__A_parable_comes_to_life.html">512 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-12-Picking pennies in front of a steamroller:  A parable comes to life</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>5 0.90236002 <a title="1417-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-Defining_ourselves_arbitrarily.html">1411 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-Defining ourselves arbitrarily</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.
 
Robin Hanson happens not to use much slang and he uses this trait to define himself, not quite to stand out in the crowd but to put himself on one end of a scale.

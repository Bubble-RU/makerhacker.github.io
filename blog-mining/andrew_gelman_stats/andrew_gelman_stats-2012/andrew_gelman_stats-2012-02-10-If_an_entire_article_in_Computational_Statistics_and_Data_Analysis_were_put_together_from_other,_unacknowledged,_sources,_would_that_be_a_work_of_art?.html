<p>Introduction: Amy Hundley writes in the New Yorker about a notorious recent case of unacknowledged literary  quilting :
  
I [Hundley] was the editor at Grove/Atlantic to whom Quentin Rowan’s novel “Appearance and the Park” was submitted (“The Plagiarist’s Tale,” by Lizzie Widdicombe, February 13th & 20th). Widdicombe writes that the editor in question thought that “its plot was too close to that of another of the house’s books, ‘My Idea of Fun,’ by Will Self,” and I can only assume that this explanation came from Rowan. In fact, Rowan had lifted a passage nearly verbatim from Will Self’s novella “The Sweet Smell of Psychosis.” It was an especially delicious one, in which Self describes the media denizens of a particular bar. I recognized it immediately and informed his agent that he’d plagiarized it. Writing a plot similar to a successful novelist’s—something that can arise innocently—is very different from plagiarizing. Appropriating and remixing someone else’s work while acknowledging sources is</p><p>3 0.13562262 <a title="1161-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-14-%E2%80%9CFree_energy%E2%80%9D_and_economic_resources.html">1010 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-14-“Free energy” and economic resources</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By “free energy” I don’t mean perpetual motion machines, cars that run on water and get 200 mpg, or the latest cold-fusion hype.
 
No, I’m referring to the term from physics.  The free energy of a system is, roughly, the amount of energy that can be directly extracted from it.  For example, a rock at room temperature is just  full  of energy—not just the energy locked in its nuclei, but basic thermal energy—but at room temperature you can’t extract any of it.
 
To the physicists in the audience:  Yes, I realize that free energy has a technical meaning in statistical mechanics and that my above definition is sloppy.  Please bear with me.  And, to the non-physicists:  feel free to head to Wikipedia or a physics textbook for a more careful treatment.
 
I was thinking about free energy the other day when hearing someone on the radio say something about China bailing out the E.U.  I did a double-take.  Huh?  The E.U. is rich, China’s not so rich.  How can a middle-income country bail out a</p><p>4 0.12801027 <a title="1161-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-03-Double_standard%3F__Plagiarizing_journos_get_slammed%2C_plagiarizing_profs_just_shrug_it_off.html">1442 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-03-Double standard?

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes on what seems to be the  topic  of the  week :
  
In reflecting on  Lehrer , I [Kahan] have to wonder why the sanction is so much more severe — basically career “death penalty” subject to parole [I think he means "life imprisonment" --- ed.], I suppose, if he manages decades of “good behavior” — for this science journalist when scholars who stick plagiarized material in their “popular science” writing don’t even get slap on wrist — more like shrug of the shoulders. I do think the behavior is comparable; if anything, it’s probably “less wrong” to make up innocuous filler quotes (the Dylan one is, for sure), then to stick paragraphs of someone else’s writing into a book. But the cause is the same: laziness. (The plagarism I’m talking about is not the sort done by Wegman; its sort done by scholars who use factory production techniques to write popular press books —  teams of research assistants who write memos, which the “author” then knits together & passes off as learne</p><p>5 0.11954716 <a title="1161-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-A_%28not_quite%29_grand_unified_theory_of_plagiarism%2C_as_applied_to_the_Wegman_case.html">728 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-A (not quite) grand unified theory of plagiarism, as applied to the Wegman case</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: Today’s item mixes two of my favorite themes in a horrible way, sort of like a Reese’s Cup but combining brussels sprouts and liver instead of peanut butter and chocolate.  In this case, the disturbing flavors that go together are  plagiarism  (you know what that is) and  the publication filter  (the  idea  that there should be very stringent standards for criticizing something, once it happens to be published somewhere).
 
 The copyist 
 
The first ingredient comes from Matthew Whitaker, an Arizona State University Foundation Professor of History who has a deplorable record of  copying material from other writers without attribution .
 
For convenience, I’ll  reproduce  an example here:
 
      
 
On the plus side; Whitaker removed the cliche’d phrase, “undisputed rulers of the roost” when copying from the online encyclopedia; on the downside, I don’t know what he was thinking when he rendered “Conservatives” with a capital letter.

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: Last month a history professor sent me a note regarding plagiarism at Arizona State University:
  
Matthew Whitaker, who had received an expedited promotion to full professor and was made Director of a new Center for the Study of Race and Democracy by Provost Elizabeth Capaldi and President Michael Crow, was charged by most of the full professors in the History Faculty with having plagiarized throughout his corpus of work, copying from regular works of scholarship and from web sources. Indeed, in his response, which claimed that the petitioners were racist, Whitaker admitted to plagiarism in his work, defending himself in part by stating that he had not reviewed carefully the research and writing he had hired others to do. . . .
  
What bothered my correspondent was that Whitaker remains an ASU Foundation Professor of History despite all the plaig. According to Whitaker’s  webpage , he “is also a highly sought after speaker, having offered commentaries on NPR, PBS, . . . and other medi</p><p>5 0.84842873 <a title="1161-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-03-Double_standard%3F__Plagiarizing_journos_get_slammed%2C_plagiarizing_profs_just_shrug_it_off.html">1442 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-03-Double standard?

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes on what seems to be the  topic  of the  week :
  
In reflecting on  Lehrer , I [Kahan] have to wonder why the sanction is so much more severe — basically career “death penalty” subject to parole [I think he means "life imprisonment" --- ed.], I suppose, if he manages decades of “good behavior” — for this science journalist when scholars who stick plagiarized material in their “popular science” writing don’t even get slap on wrist — more like shrug of the shoulders. I do think the behavior is comparable; if anything, it’s probably “less wrong” to make up innocuous filler quotes (the Dylan one is, for sure), then to stick paragraphs of someone else’s writing into a book. But the cause is the same: laziness. (The plagarism I’m talking about is not the sort done by Wegman; its sort done by scholars who use factory production techniques to write popular press books —  teams of research assistants who write memos, which the “author” then knits together & passes off as learne</p><p>6 0.83564746 <a title="1161-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-12-Plagiarists_are_in_the_habit_of_lying.html">1210 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-12-Plagiarists are in the habit of lying</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the annals of hack literature, it is sometimes said that if you aim to write best-selling crap, all you’ll end up with is crap.  To truly produce best-selling crap, you have to have a conviction, perhaps misplaced, that your writing has integrity.  Whether or not this is a good generalization about writing, I have seen an analogous phenomenon in statistics:  If you try to do nothing but model the data, you can be in for a wild and unpleasant ride:  real data always seem to have one more twist beyond our ability to model (von Neumann’s elephant’s trunk notwithstanding).  But if you model the underlying process, sometimes your model can fit surprisingly well as well as inviting openings for future research progress.</p><p>2 0.96313405 <a title="1161-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably_common_misunderstanding_of_meritocracy.html">1037 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably common misunderstanding of meritocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.  Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous”</p><p>3 0.94987643 <a title="1161-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-31-Snotty_reviewers.html">1700 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-31-Snotty reviewers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a submission a couple years ago that was rejected by a journal.  One of the reviewers began with the following snotty aside:
  
In this manuscript Gelman and Shalizi (there’s no anonymity here; this thing has been floating around the web for some time) . . .
  
Actually, we posted it on the same day we submitted it to the journal.  But double-blindness allowed the reviewer to act as if we had done something wrong!  And, even if it  had  been “floating around the web for some time,” that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Perhaps it just meant that the article had previously been rejected by a bad-attitude reviewer!</p><p>4 0.94229507 <a title="1161-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-28-Every_time_you_take_a_sample%2C_you%E2%80%99ll_have_to_pay_this_guy_a_quarter.html">1398 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-28-Every time you take a sample, you’ll have to pay this guy a quarter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Roy Mendelssohn pointed me to  this  heartwarming story of Jay Vadiveloo, an actuary who got a patent for the idea of statistical sampling.  Vadiveloo writes, “the results were astounding: statistical sampling worked.”
 
You may laugh, but wait till Albedo Man buys the patent and makes everybody do his bidding.  They’re gonna dig up Laplace and make him pay retroactive royalties.  And somehow Clippy will get involved in all this.
 
P.S.  Mendelssohn writes:  “Yes, I felt it was a heartwarming story also.  Perhaps we can get a patent for regression.”
 
I say, forget a patent for regression.  I want a patent for the sample mean.  That’s where the real money is.  You can’t charge a lot for each use, but consider the volume!</p><p>5 0.94175881 <a title="1161-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-13-Statistical_controversy_regarding_human_rights_violations_in_Colomnbia.html">145 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-13-Statistical controversy regarding human rights violations in Colomnbia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Megan Price wrote in that she and Daniel Guzmán of the Benetech Human Rights Program released a paper today entitled  “Comments to the article ‘Is Violence Against Union Members in Colombia Systematic and Targeted?’”  (o  aqui  en español), which examines an article written by Colombian academics Daniel Mejía and María José Uribe.  Price writes [in the third person]:
  
 
The paper reviewed by Price and Guzmán concluded that “. . . on average, violence against unionists in Colombia is neither systematic nor targeted.” However, in their response, Price and Guzmán present – in technical and methodological detail – the reasons they find the conclusions in Mejía and Uribe’s study to be overstated. Price and Guzmán believe that weaknesses in the data, in the choice of the statistical model, and the interpretation of the model used in Mejía and Uribe’s study, all raise serious questions about the authors’ strong causal conclusions.

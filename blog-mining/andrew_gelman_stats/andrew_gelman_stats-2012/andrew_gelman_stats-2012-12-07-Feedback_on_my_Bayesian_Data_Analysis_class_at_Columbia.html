</p><p>5 Maybe a little bit more, but I think that a better solution to this problem (students not following the math) would be to have some additional hwks that are relatively easy in which student are required to derive various formulas that are analogous to computations in the book.

[sent-52, score-1.942]
</p><p>11 But we try not to spend too much time on this; the assumption is that if you’re taking a course on Bayesian data analysis, that you’re wanting to learn this stuff for itself rather than as a comparison to anything else. [sent-63, score-0.554]

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Now that September has arrived, it’s time for us to think teaching.   Here’s something  from Andrew Heckler and Eleanor Sayre.  Heckler writes:
  
The article describes a project studying the performance of university level students taking an intro physics course. Every week for ten weeks we took 1/10th of the students (randomly selected only once) and gave them the same set of questions relevant to the course. This allowed us to plot the evolution of average performance in the class during the quarter.  We can then determine when learning occurs: For example, do they learn the material in a relevant lecture or lab or homework? Since we had about 350 students taking the course, we could get some reasonable stats.


In particular, you might be interested in Figure 10 (page 774) which shows student performance day-by-day on a particular question.  The performance does not change directly after lecture, but rather only when the homework was due.

<p>Introduction: Eoin Lawless wrote me:
  
I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  points  to an excellent rant from Peter Moskos, trashing a study about “food deserts” (which I kept reading as “food desserts”) in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Here’s Moskos:
  
From the Times:

 
There is no relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents. 


Within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood, “you can get basically any type of food,” said Roland Sturm of the RAND Corporation, lead author of one of the studies. “Maybe we should call it a food swamp rather than a desert,” he said.
 

Sure thing, Sturm. But I suspect you wouldn’t think certain neighborhoods are swamped with good food if you actually got out of your office and went to one of the neighborhoods. After all, what are going to believe: A nice data set or your lying eyes?


“Food outlet data … are classifıed using the North American Industry Classifıcation System (NAICS)” (p. 130).

<p>Introduction: I read  this article  by Rivka Galchen on quantum computing.  Much of the article was about an eccentric scientist in his fifties named David Deutch.  I’m sure the guy is brilliant but I wasn’t particularly interested in his not particularly interesting life story (apparently he’s thin and lives in Oxford).  There was a brief description of quantum computing itself, which reminds me of the discussion we had a couple years ago under the heading,  The laws of conditional probability are false  (and the update  here ).
 
I don’t have anything new to say here; I’d just never heard of quantum computing before and it seemed relevant to our discussion.  The uncertainty inherent in quantum computing seems closely related to Jouni’s idea of  fully Bayesian computing , that uncertainty should be inherent in the computational structure rather than tacked on at the end.
 
P.S.  No, I’m not working on July 4th!  This post is two months old, we just have a long waiting list of blog entries.</p><p>3 0.98283815 <a title="1611-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-27-Setting_up_Jitts_online.html">2041 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-27-Setting up Jitts online</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I use just-in-time teaching assignments in all my classes now.  Vince helpfully sent along these instructions for setting these up on Google.  See below.
 
I think Jitts are just wonderful, and they’re so easy to set up, you should definitely be doing them in your classes too.  I’ve had more difficulty with Peer Instruction (the companion tool to just-in-time teaching) as it requires questions at just the right level for the class.  I do have students frequently work in pairs, though, so I think I get some of the benefit of that.
 
P.S.  I’d love to share all the Jitts with you for Bayesian Data Analysis, but I’m afraid this would poison the well and future students would not have the opportunity to be surprised by them.  Yes, I know, I should just come up with new ones every year—but I’m not quite ready to do that!  Perhaps soon I will.
 
In the meantime, a commenter asked for some Jitts, so here are the ones for the first and last weeks of class:

<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader.

<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: Chris Said points us to two proposals to fix the system for reviewing scientific papers.  Both the proposals are focused on biological research.
 
Said  writes : 
  
  
The growing problems with scientific research are by now well known: Many results in the top journals are cherry picked, methodological weaknesses and other important caveats are often swept under the rug, and a large fraction of findings cannot be replicated. In some rare cases, there is even outright fraud. This waste of resources is unfair to the general public that pays for most of the research. . . .


Scientists have known about these problems for decades, and there have been several well-intentioned efforts to fix them. The Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis (JASNH) is specifically dedicated to null results. . . . Simmons and colleagues (2011) have proposed lists of regulations for other journals to enforce, including minimum sample sizes and requirements for the disclosure of all variables and</p><p>3 0.15005057 <a title="1429-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m postponing today’s scheduled post (“Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models”) to continue the lively discussion from yesterday,  What if I were to stop publishing in journals? . 
   
 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: Following up on my  entry  the other day on post-publication peer review, Dan Kahan writes:
  
You give me credit, I think, for merely participating in what I think is a systemic effect in the practice of empirical inquiry that conduces to quality control & hence the advance of knowledge by such means (likely the title conveys that!).  I’d say:


(a) by far the greatest weakness in the “publication regime” in social sciences today is the systematic disregard for basic principles of valid causal inference, a deficiency either in comprehension or craft that is at the root of scholars’ resort to (and journals’ tolerance for) invalid samples, the employment of designs that don’t generate observations more consistent with a hypothesis than with myriad rival ones, and the resort to deficient statistical modes of analysis that treat detection of “statististically significant difference” rather than “practical corroboration of practical meaningful effect” as the goal of such analysis (especial</p><p>6 0.12154069 <a title="1429-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-06-How_to_think_about_papers_published_in_low-grade_journals%3F.html">1928 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-06-How to think about papers published in low-grade journals?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: I received the following bizarre email:
  
Apr 26, 2013


Dear  Andrew Gelman


You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years. Currently, content on the Journal is closed access for the first 2 years after publication, and then freely accessible thereafter.  On June 1, 2013, the Journal will be extending its closed-access window from 2 years to 10 years. Extending this window will close public access to your article via the Journal web portal, but public access will still be available via the National Institutes of Health PubMedCentral web portal. 


If you would like to make your article available to the public for free on the Journal web portal, we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate of  $1,000 per article. If interested in purchasing this access, please contact Brian Selzer, Publications Editor, at brian.selzer@apha.org


Additionally, you may purchas</p><p>4 0.79926771 <a title="1429-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-06-How_to_think_about_papers_published_in_low-grade_journals%3F.html">1928 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-06-How to think about papers published in low-grade journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.  I commented as follows:
  
Read between the lines. The paper originally was released in 2009 and was published in 2013 in PLOS-One, which is one step above appearing on Arxiv. PLOS-One publishes some good things (so does Arxiv) but it’s the place</p><p>5 0.79487473 <a title="1429-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>6 0.79325044 <a title="1429-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-26-The_reverse-journal-submission_system.html">1393 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-26-The reverse-journal-submission system</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Antonio Ramos writes:
  
The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.  Beyond that, I think there is good work in psychometrics on covaraince structures but I donâ&euro;&trade;t know the literature.</p><p>2 0.93221939 <a title="1429-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-19-Updated_R_code_and_data_for_ARM.html">41 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-19-Updated R code and data for ARM</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: I get about 10 requests to referee journal articles  each week .  At this point, even the saying No part is getting tiring.  I think I’d much prefer  Kriegeskorte’s system  of post-publication review where whatever you write about a paper is open and available to all to read, and where you can devote your review efforts to papers worth reviewing (either because of their inherent quality or importance, or because they’ve been hyped and need to be corrected).</p><p>6 0.9149493 <a title="1429-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-14-Ripping_off_a_ripoff.html">1416 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-14-Ripping off a ripoff</a></p>

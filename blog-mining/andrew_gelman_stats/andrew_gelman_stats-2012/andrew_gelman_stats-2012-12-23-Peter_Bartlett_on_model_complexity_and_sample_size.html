Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy.

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Chait  writes  that the most important aspect of a presidential candidate is “political talent”:
  
Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America. Favorite character types include jocks, movie stars, folksy Texans and war heroes. . . . [But the frontrunners for the 2012 Republican nomination] make Michael Dukakis look like John F. Kennedy. They are qualified enough to serve as president, but wildly unqualified to run for president. . . . [Mitch] Daniels’s drawbacks begin — but by no means end — with his lack of height, hair and charisma. . . . [Jeb Bush] suffers from an inherent branding challenge [because of his last name]. . . . [Chris] Christie . . . doesn’t cut a trim figure and who specializes in verbally abusing his constituents. . . .  [Haley] Barbour is the comic embodiment of his party’s most negative stereotypes.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.11721728 <a title="1636-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-22-Americans_think_economy_isn%E2%80%99t_so_bad_in_their_city_but_is_crappy_nationally_and_globally.html">1388 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-22-Americans think economy isn’t so bad in their city but is crappy nationally and globally</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>4 0.78682566 <a title="1636-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.

<p>Introduction: Zach Shahn saw  this  and writes:
  
I just heard  a talk by Peter Bartlett  about model selection in “unlimited” data situations that essentially addresses this curve.


He talks about the problem of model selection given a computational budget (rather than given a sample size). You can either use your computational budget to get more data or fit a more complex model. He shows that you can get oracle inequalities for model selection algorithms under this paradigm (as long as the candidate models are nested).
  
I can’t follow all the details but it looks cool!  This is what they should be teaching in theoretical statistics class, instead of sufficient statistics and the Neyman-Pearson lemma and all that other old stuff.
 
Zach also asks:
  
I have a question about political science.  I always hear that the direction of the economy is one of the best predictors of election outcome.  What’s your thinking about the causal mechanism(s) behind the success of economic trend indicators as pr</p><p>2 0.95339823 <a title="1636-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-23-Parallel_JAGS_RNGs.html">818 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-23-Parallel JAGS RNGs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a matter of convention, we usually run 3 or 4 chains in JAGS. By default, this gives rise to chains that draw samples from 3 or 4 distinct pseudorandom number generators. I didn’t go and check whether it does things 111,222,333 or 123,123,123, but in any event the “parallel chains” in JAGS are samples drawn from distinct RNGs computed on a single processor core.
  But we all have multiple cores now, or we’re computing on a cluster or the cloud! So the behavior we’d like from  rjags  is to use the  foreach  package with each JAGS chain using a parallel-safe RNG. The default behavior with  n.chain=1  will be that each parallel instance will use  .RNG.name[1] , the Wichmann-Hill RNG. 
  JAGS 2.2.0 includes a new  lecuyer  module (along with the  glm  module, which everyone should probably always use, and doesn’t have many undocumented tricks that I know of).  But lecuyer is completely undocumented!  I tried  .RNG.name="lecuyer::Lecuyer" ,  .RNG.name="lecuyer::lecuyer" , and  .RNG.name=</p><p>3 0.95115805 <a title="1636-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-16-Memo_to_Reinhart_and_Rogoff%3A__I_think_it%E2%80%99s_best_to_admit_your_errors_and_go_on_from_there.html">1805 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-16-Memo to Reinhart and Rogoff:  I think it’s best to admit your errors and go on from there</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Ratto points me to  this  news article by Dean Baker reporting the work of three economists, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who  found  errors in a much-cited  article  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff analyzing historical statistics of economic growth and public debt.  Mike Konczal  provides  a clear summary; that’s where I got the above image.
 
 Errors in data processing and data analysis 
 
It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff flubbed it.  Herndon et al. write of “spreadsheet errors, omission of available data, weighting, and transcription.”  The spreadsheet errors are the most embarrassing, but the other choices in data analysis seem pretty bad too.  It can be tough to work with small datasets, so I have sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, but it does look like they were jumping to conclusions in their paper.  Perhaps the urgency of the topic moved them to publish as fast as possible rather than carefully considering the impact of their data-analytic choi</p><p>4 0.94146681 <a title="1636-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-08-The_Supreme_Court_meets_the_fallacy_of_the_one-sided_bet.html">1793 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-08-The Supreme Court meets the fallacy of the one-sided bet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . . I assume discrimination must be going on somep</p><p>6 0.94024992 <a title="1636-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-14-The_robust_beauty_of_improper_linear_models_in_decision_making.html">1981 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-14-The robust beauty of improper linear models in decision making</a></p>

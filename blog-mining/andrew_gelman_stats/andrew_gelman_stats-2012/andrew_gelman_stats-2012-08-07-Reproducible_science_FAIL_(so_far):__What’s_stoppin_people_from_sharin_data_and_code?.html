</p><p>7 I’ve argued that the (technical) barrier is the lack of good authoring tools for this structured data; this has sparked an argument with Stefano Mazzocchi who has focused on the (social) barrier of reluctance to share data that might be appropriated without compensating value to the author.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil
 
A  recent post on this blog  discusses a prominent case of an Excel error leading to substantially wrong results from a statistical analysis. Excel is notorious for this because it is easy to add a row or column of data (or intermediate results) but forget to update equations so that they correctly use the new data. That particular error is less common in a language like R because R programmers usually refer to data by variable name (or by applying functions to a named variable), so the same code works even if you add or remove data.
 
Still, there is plenty of opportunity for errors no matter what language one uses. Andrew  ran into problems  fairly recently, and also blogged about  another instance.  I’ve never had to retract a paper, but that’s partly because I haven’t published a whole lot of papers. Certainly I have found plenty of substantial errors pretty late in some of my data analyses, and I obviously don’t have sufficient mechanisms in place to be sure</p><p>4 0.14477253 <a title="1447-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-31-Dispute_about_ethics_of_data_sharing.html">1238 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-31-Dispute about ethics of data sharing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Sam Behseta, the new editor of Chance magazine, asked me if I’d like to have a column.  I said yes, I’d like to write on ethics and statistics.  My  first column  was called “Open Data and Open Methods” and I discussed the ethical obligation to share data and make our computations transparent wherever possible.  In my column, I recounted a story from a bit over 20 years ago when I noticed a problem in a published analysis (involving electromagnetic fields and calcium flow in chicken brains) and contacted the researcher in charge of the study, who would not share his data with me.
 
Two of the people from that research team—biologist Carl Blackman and statistician Dennis House—saw my Chance column and felt that I had misrepresented the situation and had criticized them unfairly.
 
Blackman and House expressed their concerns in letters to the editor which were just published, along with my reply, in the latest issue of  Chance .

<p>Introduction: In light of the recent  article  about drug-target research and replication (Andrew blogged it  here ) and  l’affaire   Potti , I have mentioned the  “Forensic Bioinformatics” paper  (Baggerly & Coombes 2009) to several colleagues in passing this week. I have concluded that it has not gotten the attention it deserves, though it has been  discussed  on this blog before too.

The authors try to reproduce published data, and end up “reverse engineering” what the original authors had to have done. Some examples:
  
 §2.2: “Training data sensitive/resistant labels are reversed.” 
 §2.4: “Only 84/122 test samples are distinct; some samples are labeled both sensitive and resistant.” 
 §2.7: Almost half of the data is incorrectly labeled resistant. 
 §3.2: “This offset involves a single row shift: for example, … [data from] row 98 were used instead of those from row 97.”

<p>Introduction: There is a lot of data on the web, meant to be looked at by people, but how do you turn it into a spreadsheet people could actually  analyze  statistically? 
 
The technique to turn web pages intended for people into structured data sets intended for computers is called “screen scraping.” It has just been made easier with a wiki/community  http://scraperwiki.com/ . 
 
They provide libraries to extract information from PDF, Excel files, to automatically fill in forms and similar. Moreover, the community aspect of it should allow researchers doing similar things to get connected. It’s very good. Here’s an example of scraping  road accident data  or  port of London ship arrivals .
 
You can already find collections of structured data online, examples are  Infochimps  (“find the world’s data”), and  Freebase  (“An entity graph of people, places and things, built by a community that loves open data.”). There’s also a repository system for data,  TheData  (“An open-source application for pub</p><p>4 0.86447793 <a title="1447-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-19-Factual_%E2%80%93_a_new_place_to_find_data.html">1175 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-19-Factual – a new place to find data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Factual  collects data on a variety of topics, organizes them, and allows easy access. If you ever wanted to do a histogram of calorie content in  Starbucks coffees  or plot warnings with a  live feed of earthquake data  – your life should be a bit simpler now.
 
Also see  DataMarket ,  InfoChimps , and a few older links in  The Future of Data Analysis .
 
If you access the data through the API, you can build live visualizations like this: 
   
 
Of course, you could just go to the source.  Roy Mendelssohn  writes (with minor edits):

 As we have witnessed, the term “big data” has been thrusted onto the zeitgeist in the past several years, however, when one pushes beyond the hype, there seems to be little substance there. We’ve always had “data” so what so unique about it this time? Yes, we recognize it’s “big” but is there anything unique about data this time around? 
  

I’ve spend some time thinking about this and the answer seems to be yes, and it falls on three dimensions:

 
 
  Capturing Conversations & Relationships : Individuals have always communicated with one another, but now we can capture some of that conversation – email, blogs, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest) – and we can now do it with machines via sensors, ie “the internet of things” as we hear so much about; 
  Granularity : We can now understand individuals at a much finer level of analysis. No longer do we need to rely on a sample size of 500 people to “represent” the nation, but instead we can acc</p><p>6 0.8576088 <a title="1447-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-12-OpenData_Latinoamerica.html">1853 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-12-OpenData Latinoamerica</a></p>

What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:

<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite ideas.  I used it in an application but have never formally studied it or written it up as a general method.
 
Sensitivity analysis is when you check how inferences change when you vary fit several different models or when you vary inputs within a model.  Sensitivity analysis is often recommended but is typically difficult to do, what with the hassle of carrying around all these different estimates.  In Bayesian inference, sensitivity analysis is associated with varying the prior distribution, which irritates me:  why not consider sensitivity to the likelihood, as that’s typically just as arbitrary as the prior while having a much larger effect on the inferences.
 
So we came up with  static sensitivity analysis , which is a way to assess sensitivity to assumptions while fitting only one model.  The idea is that Bayesian posterior simulation gives you a range of parameter values, and from these you can learn about sensitivity directly.

<p>Introduction: How am I supposed to handle this sort of thing?  (See below.)  I just stuck it one of my email folders without responding, but then I wondered . . . what’s it all about?  Is there some sort of Glengarry Glen Ross-like parallel world where down-on-their-luck Jack Lemmons of public relations world send out electronic cold calls?  More than anything else, this sort of thing makes me glad I have a steady job.
 
Here’s the (unsolicited) email, which came with the subject line “Please help a reporter do his job”:

I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed.

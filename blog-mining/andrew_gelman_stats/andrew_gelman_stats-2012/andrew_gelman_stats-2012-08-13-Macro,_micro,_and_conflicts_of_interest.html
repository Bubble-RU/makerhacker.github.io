<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  noted  the following quote from applied microeconomist Steven Levitt:
  
Is it surprising that scientists would try to keep work that disagrees with their findings out of journals? When I told my father that I [Levitt] was sending my work saying car seats are not that effective to medical journals, he laughed and said they would never publish it because of the result, no matter how well done the analysis was. (As is so often the case, he was right, and I eventually published it in an economics journal.)


Within the field of economics, academics work behind the scenes constantly trying to undermine each other. I’ve seen economists do far worse things than pulling tricks in figures. When economists get mixed up in public policy, things get messier.
  
At the time, I expressed dismay about Levitt’s air of (as I read it) amused, world-weary tolerance of scientists behaving against the interest of science.  But I took his story about the car seats at face value.
 
But no</p><p>3 0.26969218 <a title="1456-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>4 0.26020157 <a title="1456-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Herman_Chernoff_used_to_do_that_too%3B_also%2C_some_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_preferences.html">334 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Herman Chernoff used to do that too; also, some puzzlement over another’s puzzlement over another’s preferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Levitt  writes :.
  
 
Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.

<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.

This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>5 0.87704492 <a title="1456-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics%3A__Why_ask_%E2%80%9CWhat_went_wrong%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1100 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics:  Why ask “What went wrong?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.
 
2.  I think it was at best tacky and</p><p>6 0.85859871 <a title="1456-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-10-Update_on_Levitt_paper_on_child_car_seats.html">1491 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-10-Update on Levitt paper on child car seats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Commenters here are occasionally bothered that I spend so much time attacking frauds and plagiarists.  See, for example,  here  and  here .  Why go on and on about these losers, given that there are more important problems in the world such as war, pestilence, hunger, and graphs where the y-axis doesn’t go all the way down to zero?
 
Part of the story is that I do research for a living so I resent people who devalue research through misattribution or fraud, in the same way that rich people don’t like counterfeiters.
 
What really bugs me, though, is when cheaters get caught and still don’t admit it.  People like Hauser, Wegman, Fischer, and Weick get under my skin because they have the chutzpah to just deny deny deny.  The grainy time-stamped videotape with their hand in the cookie jar is right there, and they’ll still talk around the problem.  Makes me want to scream.
 
This happens  all the time .  All. Over. The. Place.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll points to  this  ten-year-old article from Anne-Wil Harzing on the consequences of sloppy citations.  Harzing tells the story of an unsupported claim that is contradicted by published data but has been presented as fact in a particular area of the academic literature.  She writes that “high expatriate failure rates [with "expatriate failure" defined as "the expatriate returning home before his/her contractual period of employment abroad expires"] were in fact a myth created by massive misquotations and careless copying of references.”  Many papers claimed an expatriate failure rate of 25-40% (according to Harzing, this is much higher than the actual rate as estimated from empirical data), with this overly-high rate supported by a complicated link of references leading to . . . no real data.
 
Hartzing reports the following published claims:

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.  As I  wrote last month , I respe</p><p>same-blog 4 0.94593191 <a title="1456-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-13-Macro%2C_micro%2C_and_conflicts_of_interest.html">1456 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-13-Macro, micro, and conflicts of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  and  this .  There seems to be a perception that “economists, the people who will cooly explain why people will be completely corrupt if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, see themselves as being completely not corrupt” (according to Atrios) and that “the economists who have decided to lend their names to the [Romney] campaign have been caught up in this culture of fraud” (according to Krugman).
 
The bloggers above are talking about macro, and perhaps they’re right that macroeconomists see themselves as uncorruptible and above it all.  As with political science, the key parts of macroeconomics are about what is good for the world (or, at least, what is good for the country), and it’s hard to do this well from a level of complete cynicism.  I’m no expert on macroeconomics, but my general impression is that, Marxists aside, macroeconomists tend to assume shared goals.
 
Micro, though, that’s completely different.  These dudes are happy to admit to t</p><p>5 0.94168353 <a title="1456-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-11-Debutante_Hill.html">1977 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-11-Debutante Hill</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was curious  so I ordered a used copy.  It was pretty good.  It fit in my pocket and I read it on the plane.  It was written in a bland, spare manner, not worth reading for any direct insights it would give into human nature, but the plot moved along.  And the  background material  was interesting in the window it gave into the society of the 1950s.  It was fun to read a book of pulp fiction that didnâ&euro;&trade;t have any dead bodies in it.

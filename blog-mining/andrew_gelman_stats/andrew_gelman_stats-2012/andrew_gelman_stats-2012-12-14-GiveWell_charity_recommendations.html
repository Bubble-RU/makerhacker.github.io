</p><p>8 Over time, we’ve become more and more convinced that global health is an especially promising cause for individual donors. [sent-20, score-0.312]
</p><p>9 Of course, we agree that there are worthwhile charities working in other areas of international giving, and in the past we’ve recommended  Pratham , an Indian education NGO, for donors especially interested in education. [sent-22, score-0.827]
</p><p>10 We recently de-emphasized the category of “standouts” (where Pratham fell) because they received a relatively small portion of the money given based on our recommendations and we felt that our research time was better-spent in areas we find more promising. [sent-23, score-0.149]
</p><p>11 Here’s what GiveWell wrote about Pratham:    Pratham is a large, India-based organization that runs a wide variety of programs aiming to improve education for children in India. [sent-25, score-0.329]
</p><p>12 We recommend Pratham as our top recommendation for developing-world education because:    - GiveWell staff visited Pratham programs two times in Mumbai, India during the fall of 2010. [sent-30, score-0.434]
</p><p>13 - Our impression is that Pratham has a strong reputation among people who are familiar with Indian educational organizations. [sent-33, score-0.306]
</p><p>14 Pratham has a strong reputation among respected international aid scholars such as researchers at the Poverty Action Lab at MIT. [sent-34, score-0.338]
</p><p>15 4 In addition, several representatives from other charities in India, told us (unsolicited) that they have the impression that Pratham is a strong organization. [sent-35, score-0.441]
</p><p>16 Programs that intuitively seem effective such as building schools, training teachers or providing textbooks do not have a strong track record of success. [sent-37, score-0.284]
</p><p>17 (For more on this cause, see our overview of developing-world education programs. [sent-38, score-0.243]
</p><p>18 ) In a sector with limited evidence about what works, Pratham stands out for having subjected its programs to rigorous trials to determine which approaches are most effective. [sent-39, score-0.218]
</p><p>19 Nevertheless, for donors interested in the cause of developing-world education, we have found no organization stronger than Pratham. [sent-42, score-0.261]

<p>Introduction: Alexander at GiveWell  writes :
  
The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>3 0.10578181 <a title="1623-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-13-D._Kahneman_serves_up_a_wacky_counterfactual.html">709 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-13-D.

<p>Introduction: I followed a  link  from Tyler Cowen to  this bit  by Daniel Kahneman:
  
Education is an important determinant of income — one of the most important — but it is less important than most people think. If everyone had the same education, the inequality of income would be reduced by less than 10%. When you focus on education you neglect the myriad other factors that determine income. The differences of income among people who have the same education are huge.
  
I think I know what he’s saying–if you regress income on education and other factors, and then you take education out of the model, R-squared decreases by 10%.  Or something like that.  Not necessarily R-squared, maybe you fit the big model, then get predictions for everyone putting in the mean value for education and look at the sd of incomes or the Gini index or whatever.  Or something else along those lines.
 
My problem is with the counterfactual:  “If everyone had the same education . . .”  I have a couple problems with this</p><p>4 0.075810283 <a title="1623-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-22-Researching_the_cost-effectiveness_of_political_lobbying_organisations.html">969 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-22-Researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My Columbia colleague Irv Garfinkel recently came out with a book (with coauthors Lee Rainwater and Timothy Smeeding), “Mythbusters:  The U.S. Social Welfare State,” where they argue:
  
The United States is a capitalist nation that has eschewed Scandinavian-style socialist policies in favor of capitalism and economic growth, right? Wrong. The U.S. is not only one of the largest welfare states in the world, but it is strong economically precisely because of its adoption of some socialist policies–with public education as the primary driver.


The American welfare state faces large challenges. Restoring its historical lead in education is the most important but requires investing large sums in education–beginning with universal pre-school–and in complementary programs–including selected cash benefits for families with children–that aid children’s development. The American health insurance system is by far the most costly in the rich world, yet fails to insure one sixth of its population</p><p>6 0.066545837 <a title="1623-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-21-Roller_coasters%2C_charity%2C_profit%2C_hmmm.html">157 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-21-Roller coasters, charity, profit, hmmm</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

 
The hazards posed by climate change, sea level rise, and severe storm surges make this the time to transform our coastal cities through adaptive design.

<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies.

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: Antonio Ramos writes:
  
The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.  Beyond that, I think there is good work in psychometrics on covaraince structures but I donâ&euro;&trade;t know the literature.</p><p>2 0.94666606 <a title="1623-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-An_Olympic_size_swimming_pool_full_of_lithium_water.html">179 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-An Olympic size swimming pool full of lithium water</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: I opened the newspaper today (recall that this blog is on an approximately one-month delay) to see a moderately horrifying  story  about art appraisers who are deterred by fear of lawsuits from expressing an opinion about possible forgeries.
 
Maybe this trend will come to science too?  Perhaps Brett Pelham will sue Uri Simonsohn for the pain, suffering, and loss of income occurring from the  questioning of his Dennis the dentist paper ?  Or maybe I’ll be sued by some rogue sociologist for publicly questioning his data dredging?
 
Anyway, what amused me about the NYT article on art forgery was that two of the artists featured in the discussion were . . . Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein!  Warhol is famous for diluting the notion of the unique art object and for making works of art in a “Factory,” and Lichtenstein is famous for ripping off the style and imagery of comic book artists.  It’s funny for the two of them, of all people, to come up in a discussion of authenticity.

<p>Introduction: Chris Wiggins writes of an interesting-looking summer program that undergraduate or graduate students can apply to:
  
The hackNY Fellows program is an initiative to mentor the next generation of technology innovators in New York, focusing on tech startups. Last summer’s  class of fellows  was paired with NYC startups which demonstrated they could provide a mentoring environment (a clear project, a person who could work with the Fellow, and sufficient stability to commit to 10 weeks of compensation for the Fellow).  hackNY, with the support of the Kauffman foundation and the Internet Society of New York, provided shared housing in NYU dorms in Union Square, and organized a series of pedagogical lectures. 


hackNY was founded by Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly, Evan Korth, professor of CS at NYU, and Chris Wiggins, professor of applied mathematics at Columbia.

<p>Introduction: 14. A public health survey of elderly Americans includes many questions, including “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” and also several questions about current mobility and health status. Response rates are high for the questions about recent activities and status, but there is a lot of nonresponse for the question on past activity. You are considering imputing the missing values on the question, “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” Which of the following statements are basically correct? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If done reasonably well, imputation is preferred to available-case and complete-case analysis.

<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: Jay Ulfelder asks:
  
I have a question for you about what to do in a situation where you have two measures of your dependent variable and no prior reasons to strongly favor one over the other.


Here’s what brings this up: I’m working on a project with Michael Ross where we’re modeling transitions to and from democracy in countries worldwide since 1960 to estimate the effects of oil income on the likelihood of those events’ occurrence. We’ve got a TSCS data set, and we’re using a discrete-time event history design, splitting the sample by regime type at the start of each year and then using multilevel logistic regression models with parametric measures of time at risk and random intercepts at the country and region levels. (We’re also checking for the usefulness of random slopes for oil wealth at one or the other level and then including them if they improve a model’s goodness of fit.) All of this is being done in Stata with the gllamm module.

<p>Introduction: 15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well. Come up with a scheme for inverse-probability weights (ignoring nonresponse and assuming there is exactly one phone line per household).

<p>Introduction: 11. Here is the result of fitting a logistic regression to Republican vote in the 1972 NES.
 
   
 
Income is on a 1â&euro;&ldquo;5 scale. Approximately how much more likely is a person in income category 4 to vote Republican, compared to a person income category 2? Give an approximate estimate, standard error, and 95% interval.
 
 Solution to question 10 
 
From  yesterday :
  
10. Out of a random sample of 100 Americans, zero report having ever held political office. From this information, give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have ever held political office.

<p>Introduction: 13. A survey of American adults is conducted that includes too many women and not enough men in the sample. In the resulting weighting, each female respondent is given a weight of 1 and each male respondent is given a weight of 1.5. The sample includes 600 women and 380 men, of whom 400 women and 100 men respond Yes to a particular question of interest. Give an estimate and standard error for the proportion of American adults who would answer Yes to this question if asked.

<p>Introduction: Lasso and me 
 
For a long time I was wrong about lasso.
 
Lasso (“least absolute shrinkage and selection operator”) is a regularization procedure that shrinks regression coefficients toward zero, and in its basic form is equivalent to maximum penalized likelihood estimation with a penalty function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients.
 
I first heard about lasso from a talk that  Trevor Hastie  Rob Tibshirani gave at Berkeley in 1994 or 1995.  He demonstrated that it shrunk regression coefficients to zero.  I wasn’t impressed, first because it seemed like no big deal (if that’s the prior you use, that’s the shrinkage you get) and second because, from a Bayesian perspective, I don’t  want  to shrink things all the way to zero.  In the sorts of social and environmental science problems I’ve worked on, just about nothing is zero.  I’d like to control my noisy estimates but there’s nothing special about zero.  At the end of the talk I stood</p><p>3 0.98109591 <a title="1340-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-06-%E2%80%9CSampling%3A__Design_and_Analysis%E2%80%9D%3A__a_course_for_political_science_graduate_students.html">749 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-06-“Sampling:  Design and Analysis”:  a course for political science graduate students</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Early this afternoon I made the plan to teach a new course on sampling, maybe next spring, with the primary audience being political science Ph.D. students (although I hope to get students from statistics, sociology, and other departments).  Columbia already has a sampling course in the statistics department (which I taught for several years); this new course will be centered around political science questions.  Maybe the students can start by downloading data from the National Election Studies and General Social Survey and running some regressions, then we can back up and discuss what is needed to go further.
 
About an hour after discussing this new course with my colleagues, I (coincidentally) received the following email from Mike Alvarez:
  
If you were putting together a reading list on sampling for a grad course, what would you say are the essential readings?  I thought I’d ask you because I suspect you might have taught something along these lines.

<p>Introduction: Peter Huber’s most famous work derives from  his paper  on robust statistics published nearly fifty years ago in which he introduced the concept of M-estimation (a generalization of maximum likelihood) to unify some ideas of Tukey and others for estimation procedures that were relatively insensitive to small departures from the assumed model.
 
Huber has in many ways been ahead of his time.  While remaining connected to the theoretical ideas from the early part of his career, his interests have shifted to computational and graphical statistics.  I never took Huber’s class on data analysis–he left Harvard while I was still in graduate school–but fortunately I have an opportunity to learn his lessons now, as he has just released a book, “Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years.”
 
The book puts together a few articles published in the past 15 years, along with some new material.  Many of the examples are decades old, which is appropriate given that Huber is reviewing f</p><p>5 0.98063779 <a title="1340-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-07-The_%24900_kindergarten_teacher.html">261 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-07-The $900 kindergarten teacher</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Bleicher writes:
  
 This  simply screams “post-hoc, multiple comparisons problem,” though I haven’t seen the paper.


A quote from the  online news report :


The findings revealed that kindergarten matters–a lot.  Students of kindergarten teachers with above-average experience earn $900 more in annual wages than students of teachers with less experience than average. Being in a class of 15 students instead of a class of 22 increased students’ chances of attending college, especially for children who were disadvantaged . . . Children whose test scores improved to the 60th percentile were also less likely to become single parents, more likely to own a home by age 28, and more likely to save for retirement earlier in their work lives.
  
I haven’t seen the paper either.  $900 doesn’t seem like so much to me, but I suppose it depends where you stand on the income ladder.
 
Regarding the multiple comparisons problem:  this could be a great example for fitting a  multilevel model .

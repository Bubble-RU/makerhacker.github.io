<p>Introduction: Justin Phillips placed some questions on the  YouGov Model Politics poll  and reports the following:
     
Early this month, Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) angered gay rights organizations when he said that openly gay people (along with sexually active unmarried women) shouldn’t be teaching in the classroom.  This comment was originally reported in the Spartanberg Herald-Journal and subsequently covered by a variety of national media outlets including CBS News.


The Senator justified his comments by suggesting that his beliefs are shared by many Americans.  DeMint told the Herald Journal “[When I said those things] no one came to my defense. But everyone would come to me and whisper that I shouldn’t back down. They don’t want government purging their rights and their freedom to religion.”


So is the Senator correct?  Do Americans want openly gay men and women out of the classroom? . . .


Most Americans do not share Senator DeMint’s views. Our survey shows that a large majorit</p><p>3 0.10408081 <a title="1404-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar_update%3A__Additional_research_on_estimating_small_fractions_of_the_population.html">150 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar update:  Additional research on estimating small fractions of the population</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gary Gates writes the following in response to the discussion of  my recent blog  on the difficulty of using “gaydar” to estimate the frequencies of gays in a population:
  
First,  here’s  a better (I think, anyway) method than using AIDS deaths from the NY Times (yikes!) to estimate the % of the military that is gay or lesbian.
  
Gates estimates 2.2%, with, unsurprisingly, a higher rate among women than men.
 
He continues:
  
 Here’s  a tale of the false positive problem affecting who gets counted as same-sex couples in the Census and attached is a working paper that updates those analyses (with better methods, I think) using ACS data.
  
In this paper, Gates (along with Dan Black, Seth Sanders, and Lowell Taylor) finds:
  
Our work indicates that over 40 percent of same-sex “unmarried partner” couples in the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census are likely misclassified different-sex couples.
  
40% misclassification.  Wow.</p><p>4 0.10052641 <a title="1404-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-29-The_difficulties_of_measuring_just_about_anything.html">2043 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-29-The difficulties of measuring just about anything</a></p>

The original report is quite clear about weighting things, smaple sizes, etc.  The apparent “clincher” argument in the editorial—that over 50% of unwanted sexual advances in the military are experienced by men—seems to confound several things.  The first being, of course, that with only 14% of service members being female, it is quite likely by their broad definition that the 86% of service members who are men actually *do* comprise the majority of unwanted sexual attention even if the incidence is only a fraction of that of female service members.

<p>Introduction: From a recent email exchange:
 
I agree that you should never compare p-values directly.  The p-value is a strange nonlinear transformation of data that is only interpretable under the null hypothesis. Once you abandon the null (as we do when we observe something with a very low p-value), the p-value itself becomes irrelevant.  To put it another way, the p-value is a measure of evidence, it is not an estimate of effect size (as it is often treated, with the idea that a p=.001 effect is larger than a p=.01 effect, etc).  Even conditional on sample size, the p-value is not a measure of effect size.</p><p>6 0.088217698 <a title="1404-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-03-The_Employment_Nondiscrimination_Act_is_overwhelmingly_popular_in_nearly_every_one_of_the_50_states.html">2087 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-03-The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is overwhelmingly popular in nearly every one of the 50 states</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alexander at GiveWell  writes :
  
The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43.

<p>Introduction: My article with Daniel and Yair  has recently appeared in The Forum:
  
We use multilevel modeling to estimate support for health-care reform by age, income, and state. Opposition to reform is concentrated among higher-income voters and those over 65. Attitudes do not vary much by state. Unfortunately, our poll data only go to 2004, but we suspect that much can be learned from the relative positions of different demographic groups and different states, despite swings in national opinion. We speculate on the political implications of these findings.
  
The article features some pretty graphs that originally appeared on the blog.
 
It’s in a special issue on health care politics that has several interesting articles, among which I’d like to single out  this one  by Bob Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs entitled, “Simulating Representation: Elite Mobilization and Political Power in Health Care Reform”:

I have read an  article  on NPR and the  journal article  that spun this news.  


What draw my attention was the discussion in terms of causation implied by one of the authors of the article interviewed in the NPR news, and also by the conclusions of the article itself claiming large effects.


Although the total sample (self-selecting pregnant women) seems very large (85,176) the subsamples (270 out of which 114 were in the sub-subsample revealing statistically significant association) used to support the analysis seem to be too small. Or not?
  
My response:
 
The different sources of information do seem to be in some conflict:
 
- The JAMA article reports the autism rate of 1 per 1000 for children of mothers taking folic acid and 2 per 1000 for children of mothers not taking folic acid.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll points to  this  ten-year-old article from Anne-Wil Harzing on the consequences of sloppy citations.  Harzing tells the story of an unsupported claim that is contradicted by published data but has been presented as fact in a particular area of the academic literature.  She writes that “high expatriate failure rates [with "expatriate failure" defined as "the expatriate returning home before his/her contractual period of employment abroad expires"] were in fact a myth created by massive misquotations and careless copying of references.”  Many papers claimed an expatriate failure rate of 25-40% (according to Harzing, this is much higher than the actual rate as estimated from empirical data), with this overly-high rate supported by a complicated link of references leading to . . . no real data.
 
Hartzing reports the following published claims:

<p>Introduction: Gary Gates   writes :
  
In a recent study, the author of this article estimated that the self- identified lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community makes up 3.8 percent of the American population. The authorâ&euro;&trade;s estimate was far lower than many scholars and activists had contended, and it included a relatively high proportion of persons self-identifying as bisexuals. This article responds to two of the central criticisms that arose in the controversy that followed. First, in response to claims that his estimate did not account for people who are in the closet, the author describes how demographers might measure the size of the closet. Second, in response to those who either ignored the reported large incidence of bisexuality or misconstrued the meaning of that incidence, the Author considers how varying frameworks for conceptualizing sexual orientation might alter the ratio of lesbian or gay individuals to bisexuals.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school. Of the 35 brownstones t</p><p>3 0.94249171 <a title="1404-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-Estimates_of_war_deaths%3A__Darfur_edition.html">64 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-Estimates of war deaths:  Darfur edition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps because of  these discussions , I was pointed toward  an article  on “Rethinking Darfur” by Marc Gustafson, which was written up in a news story  here .  From the publicity email:
  
 
This paper is intended to challenge the conventional wisdom about the causes and levels of violence in Darfur during the conflict there. Gustafson, a Marshall Scholar at Oxford, draws on historical analysis, explores mortality surveys, and dissects six years of American budgetary allocations in Sudan, contending that while the war in Darfur has had horrific results, it has been mischaracterized persistently in terms of the scale and causes of the conflict.  Gustafson argues that these mischaracterizations had negative effects on elite and public understanding of the conflict, and consequently had a rather dubious effect on policy choices.
 

 
I don’t have time to look at this and so offer no comment one way or the other, but I thought it might be of interest to some of you, so I’m posting it her</p><p>4 0.94020271 <a title="1404-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-21-Scrabble%21.html">813 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-21-Scrabble!</a></p>

Sitting on my [AT's] to-do list for a while now has been an exploration of Scrabble from an experimental design point of view; how to better design a tournament to make the variance as small as possible while still preserving the appearance of the home game to its players. . . . 


I’m proud (relieved?) to say that I’ve finally  finished the first draft  of this work for two-player head-to-head games, with a duplication method that ensures that if the game were repeated, each player would receive tiles from the reserve in the same sequence: think of the tiles being laid out in order (but unseen to the players), so that one player draws from the front and the other draws from the back. . . .


One goal of this was to figure out how much of the variance in score comes from the tile order and how much comes from the board, given that a tile order would be expected. It turns out to be about half-bag, half-board . . .


Some other findings from the simulations:

<p>Introduction: This story  reminds me that, when I was in grad school, the state of Massachusetts instituted a seat-belt law which became a big controversy.  A local talk show host made it his pet project to shoot down the law, and he succeeded!  There was a ballot initiative and the voters repealed the seat belt law.  A few years later the law returned (it was somehow tied in with Federal highway funding, I think, the same way they managed to get all the states to up the drinking age to 21), and, oddly enough, nobody seemed to care the second time around.
 
It’s funny how something can be a big political issue one year and nothing the next.  I have no deep insights on the matter, but it’s worth remembering that these sorts of panics are nothing new.  Recall E.S. Turner’s classic book, Roads to Ruin.  I think there’s a research project in here, to understand what gets an issue to be a big deal and how it is that some controversies just fade away.</p><p>6 0.91363835 <a title="1404-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-10-On_deck_this_week.html">2206 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-10-On deck this week</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Zosia Chustecka  writes : 
  
  
Much of the previous work on the link between cancer and nightshifts has focused on breast cancer . . . The latest report, focusing on ovarian cancer,  was published  in the April issue of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.


This increase in the risk for ovarian cancer with nightshift work is consistent with, and of similar magnitude to, the risk for breast cancer, say lead author Parveen Bhatti, PhD, and colleagues from the epidemiology program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.


The researchers examined data from a local population-based cancer registry that is part of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. They identified 1101 women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, 389 with borderline disease, and 1832 without ovarian cancer (control group).


The women, who were 35 to 74 years of age, were asked about the hours they worked, and specifically whether they had ever worked the nig</p><p>4 0.15420315 <a title="1288-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-A_survey%E2%80%99s_not_a_survey_if_they_don%E2%80%99t_tell_you_how_they_did_it.html">761 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-A survey’s not a survey if they don’t tell you how they did it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we’re on  the topic  of nonreplicable research . . . see  here  (link from  here ) for a story of a survey that’s so bad that the people who did it won’t say how they did it.
 
I know too many cases where people screwed up in a survey when they were actually trying to get the right answer, for me to trust any report of a survey that doesn’t say what they did.
 
I’m reminded of  this survey  which may well have been based on a sample of size 6 (again, the people who did it refused to release any description of methodology).</p><p>5 0.1438466 <a title="1288-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Question_28_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1371 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Question 28 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:

<p>Introduction: Since we’re on  the topic  of nonreplicable research . . . see  here  (link from  here ) for a story of a survey that’s so bad that the people who did it won’t say how they did it.
 
I know too many cases where people screwed up in a survey when they were actually trying to get the right answer, for me to trust any report of a survey that doesn’t say what they did.
 
I’m reminded of  this survey  which may well have been based on a sample of size 6 (again, the people who did it refused to release any description of methodology).</p><p>6 0.67115062 <a title="1288-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-16-%E2%80%9CNightshifts_Linked_to_Increased_Risk_for_Ovarian_Cancer%E2%80%9D.html">1766 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-16-“Nightshifts Linked to Increased Risk for Ovarian Cancer”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  points  to a  report  from a corporate survey:
  
Sixty-two percent of U.S. employees say it’s not likely they or a family member will be diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer, a survey indicates.


The Aflac WorkForces Report, a survey of nearly 1,900 benefits decision-makers and more than 6,100 U.S. workers, also indicated 55 percent said they were not very or not at all likely to be diagnosed with a chronic illness, such as heart disease or diabetes.
  
Here are some actual statistics:
  
The American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2012, said 1-in-3 women and 1-in-2 men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, and the National Safety Council, Injury Facts 2011 edition, says more than 38.9 million injuries occur in a year requiring medical treatment.


The American Heart Association, Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics 2012, said 1-in-6 U.S. deaths were caused by coronary heart disease, Tillman said.
  
And some details on the survey:</p><p>2 0.99827653 <a title="1288-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Christakis-Fowler_update.html">756 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Christakis-Fowler update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: Joan Garfield, a leading researcher in statistics education, is conducting a survey of graduate students who teach or assist with the teaching of statistics.  She writes: 
  
  
We want to invite them to take a short survey that will enable us to collect some baseline data that we may use in a grant proposal we are developing.  The project would provide summer workshops and ongoing support for graduate students who will be teaching or assisting with teaching introductory statistics classes. If the grant is funded, we would invite up to 40 students from around the country who are entering graduate programs in statistics to participate in a three-year training and support program.  The goal of this program is to help these students become expert and flexible teachers of statistics, and to support them as they move through their teaching experiences as graduate students.
  
Here’s the  the online survey .  Garfield writes, “Your responses are completely voluntary and anonymous.

<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.
 
2.  Setting up coefplot so it works more generally (that is, so the graphics look nice</p><p>5 0.99761051 <a title="1288-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-Climate_Change_News.html">180 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-Climate Change News</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).  Each of the plots overlays data from several databases (not necessarily indepenedent of each other), and you can select which ones to include or leave</p><p>6 0.99758148 <a title="1288-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-01-Literature_and_life.html">174 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-01-Literature and life</a></p>

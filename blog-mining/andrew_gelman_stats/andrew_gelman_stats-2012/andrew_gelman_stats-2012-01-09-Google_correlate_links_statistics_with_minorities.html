<p>Introduction: I always thought predicting traffic for a particular day and time would be something easily predicted from historic data with regression. Google Maps now has this feature:
 
   
 
It would be good to actually include season, holiday and similar information: the predictions would  be better. I wonder if one can find this data easily, or if others have done this work before.</p><p>3 0.04522315 <a title="1109-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-30-Memorial_Day_question.html">737 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-30-Memorial Day question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>4 0.044965945 <a title="1109-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-28-Creating_a_Lenin-style_democracy.html">2270 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-28-Creating a Lenin-style democracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  explains  why a penalty for getting the wrong answer on a test (the SAT, which is used in college admissions and which is used in the  famous  8 schools example) is  not  a “penalty for guessing.”  Then the very next day he catches this from Todd Balf in the New York Times Magazine: 
  
  
Students were docked one-quarter point for every multiple-choice question they got wrong, requiring a time-consuming risk analysis to determine which questions to answer and which to leave blank.
  
Ugh!  That just makes me want to . . . ok, I won’t go there.  Anyway, Palko  goes to the trouble  to explain:
  
While time management for a test like the SAT can be complicated, the rule for guessing is embarrassingly simple: give your best guess for questions you read; don’t waste time guessing on questions that you didn’t have time to read.


The risk analysis actually becomes much more complicated when you take away the penalty for guessing. On the ACT (or the new SAT), there is a positive</p><p>5 0.042109121 <a title="1109-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-14-Extra_babies_on_Valentine%E2%80%99s_Day%2C_fewer_on_Halloween%3F.html">1167 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-14-Extra babies on Valentine’s Day, fewer on Halloween?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just in time for the holiday, X  pointed  me to  an article  by Becca Levy, Pil Chung, and Martin Slade reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days: 
   
 
What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year.  It would be easy enough to make.  That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.  While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates.  It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.
 
The data are publicly available, so maybe someone could make those graphs?  If the Valentine’s/Halloween data are worth publishing, I think more comprehensive graphs should be publishable as well.  I’d post them here, that’s for sure.</p><p>6 0.041067105 <a title="1109-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-10-Bringing_Causal_Models_Into_the_Mainstream.html">703 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-10-Bringing Causal Models Into the Mainstream</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff the Productivity Sapper points me to  this insulting open letter to Nate Silver  written by pollster John Zogby.  I’ll go through bits of Zogby’s note line by line.  (Conflict of interest warning:  I have collaborated with Nate and I blog on his site).
  
Zogby writes:  Here is some advice from someone [Zogby] who has been where you [Silver] are today.
  
Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.
  
Zogby writes:  You [Nate] are hot right now – using an aggregate of other people’s work, you got 49 of 50 states right in 2008.
  
Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.

<p>Introduction: In response to the latest  controversy , a statistics professor writes:
  
It’s somewhat surprising to see Very Serious Researchers (apologies to Paul Krugman) using Excel.  Some years ago, I was consulting on a trademark infringement case and was trying (unsuccessfully) to replicate another expert’s regression analysis.  It wasn’t until I had the brainstorm to use Excel that I was able to reproduce his results – it may be better now, but at the time, Excel could propagate round-off error and catastrophically cancel like no other software!
  
Microsoft has lots of top researchers so it’s hard for me to understand how Excel can remain so crappy.  I mean, sure, I understand in some general way that they have a large user base, it’s hard to maintain backward compatibility, there’s feature creep, and, besides all that, lots of people have different preferences in data analysis than I do.  But still, it’s such a joke.

I know that in art, quality and value are two very different things.  Still, I had to stop and wonder when I read about

 
Domenico and Eleanore De Sole, who in 2004 paid $8.3 million for a painting attributed to Mark Rothko that they now say is a worthless fake.
 

One day a painting is worth $8.3 million; the next day, the same painting – same quality, same capacity to give aesthetic pleasure or do whatever it is that art does – is “worthless.”*  Art forgery also makes me wonder about the buyer’s motive.  If the buyer wanted only to have and to gaze upon something beautiful, something with artistic merit, then a fake Rothko is no different than a real Rothko.  It seems more likely that what the buyer wants is to own something valuable – i.e., something that costs a lot. Displaying your brokerage account statements is just too crude and obvious.

 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.
 
P.S.   More here  from Kaiser Fung on fundamental flaws with Schoen’s poll.</p><p>3 0.60926676 <a title="1109-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-21-New_search_engine_for_data_%26_statistics.html">724 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-21-New search engine for data & statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jon Goldhill points us to a new search engine,  Zanran , which is for finding data and statistics.  Goldhill writes:
  
It’s useful when you’re looking for a graph/table rather than a single number.  For example, if you look for ‘teenage births rates in the united states’ in Zanran you’ll see a series of graphs.  If you check in Google, there’s plenty of material – but you’d have to open everything up to see if it had any real numbers.  (I hope you’ll appreciate Zanran’s preview capability as well – hovering over the icons gives a useful preview of the content.)</p><p>4 0.60596216 <a title="1109-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-28-What_Zombies_see_in_Scatterplots.html">595 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-28-What Zombies see in Scatterplots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This video caught my interest –  news video clip   
(from this 
 post2 )

The news commentator did seem to be trying to point out what a couple of states had to say about the claimed relationship – almost on their own. 
 
Some  methods  have been worked out for zombies to do just this!
 
So I grabbed the data as close as I quickly could, modified the code slightly and here’s the zombie veiw of it.

North Carolina is the bolded red curve, Idaho the bolded green curve. 
Missisipi and New York are the bolded blue.
 
As ugly as it is this is the Bayasian marginal picture – exactly (given MCMC errror).
 
K? 
p.s. you will get a very confusing picture if you forget to centre the x (i.e. see chapter 4 of Gelman and Hill book)</p><p>5 0.53761983 <a title="1109-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-04-Columbo_does_posterior_predictive_checks.html">1521 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-04-Columbo does posterior predictive checks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m already on record as saying that  Ronald Reagan was a statistician  so I think this is ok too . . .
 
   
 
Here’s what Columbo does.  He hears the killer’s story and he takes it very seriously (it’s murder, and Columbo never jokes about murder), examines all its implications, and finds where it doesn’t fit the data.  Then Columbo carefully examines the discrepancies, tries some model expansion, and eventually concludes that he’s proved there’s a problem.
 
OK, now you’re saying:  Yeah, yeah, sure, but how does that differ from any other fictional detective?  The difference, I think, is that the tradition is for the detective to find clues and use these to come up with hypotheses, or to trap the killer via internal contradictions in his or her statement.  I see Columbo is different—and more in keeping with chapter 6 of Bayesian Data Analysis—in that he is taking the killer’s story seriously and exploring all its implications.  That’s the essence of predictive model checking:  you t</p><p>6 0.53755462 <a title="1109-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-Census_dotmap.html">1653 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-Census dotmap</a></p>

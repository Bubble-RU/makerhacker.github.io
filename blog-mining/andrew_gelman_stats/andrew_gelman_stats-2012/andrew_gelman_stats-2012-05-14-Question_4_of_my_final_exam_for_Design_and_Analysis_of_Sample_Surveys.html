<p>Introduction: 5. Which of the following better describes changes in public opinion on most issues? (Choose only one.)
 
(a) Dynamic stability: On any given issue, average opinion remains stable but liberals and conservatives move back and forth in opposite directions (the “accordion model”)
 
(b) Uniform swing: Average opinion on an issue can move but the liberals and conservatives don’t move much relative to each other (the disribution of opinions is a “solid block of wood”)

<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.  Misclassifications that induce seemingly minor biases in estimates of certain small probab</p><p>5 0.19119811 <a title="1320-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar_update%3A__Additional_research_on_estimating_small_fractions_of_the_population.html">150 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar update:  Additional research on estimating small fractions of the population</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gary Gates writes the following in response to the discussion of  my recent blog  on the difficulty of using “gaydar” to estimate the frequencies of gays in a population:
  
First,  here’s  a better (I think, anyway) method than using AIDS deaths from the NY Times (yikes!) to estimate the % of the military that is gay or lesbian.
  
Gates estimates 2.2%, with, unsurprisingly, a higher rate among women than men.
 
He continues:
  
 Here’s  a tale of the false positive problem affecting who gets counted as same-sex couples in the Census and attached is a working paper that updates those analyses (with better methods, I think) using ACS data.
  
In this paper, Gates (along with Dan Black, Seth Sanders, and Lowell Taylor) finds:
  
Our work indicates that over 40 percent of same-sex “unmarried partner” couples in the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census are likely misclassified different-sex couples.
  
40% misclassification.  Wow.</p><p>6 0.18956104 <a title="1320-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Question_28_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1371 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Question 28 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

From  yesterday :
  
15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well.

Hereby I contact you to clarify the situation that occurred with the publication of the article entitled *** which was published in Volume 11, Issue 3 of *** and I made the mistake of declaring as an author.  This chapter is a plagiarism of . . .


I wish to express and acknowledge that I am solely responsible for this . . . I recognize the gravity of the offense committed, since there is no justification for so doing. Therefore, and as a sign of shame and regret I feel in this situation, I will publish this letter, in order to set an example for other researchers do not engage in a similar error.


No more, and to please accept my apologies,


Sincerely,

<p>Introduction: I remember in 4th grade or so, the teacher would give us a list of vocabulary words each week and we’d have to show we learned them by using each in a sentence.  We quickly got bored and decided to do the assignment by writing a single sentence using all ten words.  (Which the teacher hated, of course.)
 
The above headline is in that spirit, combining  blog   posts  rather than vocabulary words.
 
But that only uses two of the entries.  To really do the job, I’d need to throw in bivariate associations, ecological fallacies, high-dimensional feature selection, statistical significance, the suddenly unpopular name Hilary, snotty reviewers, the contagion of obesity, and milk-related spam.
 
Or we could bring in some of the all-time favorites, such as Bayesians, economists, Finland, beautiful parents and their daughters, goofy graphics, red and blue states, essentialism in children’s reasoning, chess running, and zombies.

<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: 4. Researchers have found that survey respondents overreport church attendance. Thus, naive estimates from surveys overstate the percentage of Americans who attend church regularly. Does this have a large impact on estimates of time trends in religious attendance?
 
 Solution to question 3 
 
From  yesterday :
  
3. We discussed in class the best currently available method for estimating the proportion of military servicemembers who are gay. What is that method? (Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)
  
Solution:  I was talking about the  work  of Gary Gates, combining an estimate of the percentage of gays in the population with an estimate of the probability that someone is in the military, given that he or she is gay.</p><p>5 0.9405911 <a title="1320-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-31-Untunable_Metropolis.html">833 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-31-Untunable Metropolis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Margolis writes:
  
What are we to make of it when a Metropolis-Hastings step just won’t tune? That is, the acceptance rate is zero at expected-jump-size X, and way above 1/2 at X-exp(-16) (i.e.,  machine precision ).


I’ve solved my practical problem by writing that I would have liked to include results from a diffuse prior, but couldn’t. But I’m bothered by the poverty of my intuition. And since everything I’ve read says this is an issue of efficiency, rather than accuracy, I wonder if I could solve it just by running massive and heavily thinned chains.
  
My reply:
 
I can’t see how this could happen in a well-specified problem!  I suspect it’s a bug.  Otherwise try rescaling your variables so that your parameters will have values on the order of magnitude of 1.
 
To which Margolis responded:
  
I hardly wrote any of the code, so I can’t speak to the bug question — it’s binomial kriging from the R package geoRglm. And there are no covariates to scale — just the zero and one</p><p>6 0.93898427 <a title="1320-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-09-Familial_Linkage_between_Neuropsychiatric_Disorders_and_Intellectual_Interests.html">1160 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-09-Familial Linkage between Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Intellectual Interests</a></p>

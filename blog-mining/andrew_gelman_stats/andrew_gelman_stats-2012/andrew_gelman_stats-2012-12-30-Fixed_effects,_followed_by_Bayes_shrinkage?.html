<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
I am hoping you can give me some advice about when to use fixed and random effects model. I am currently working on a paper that examines the effect of . . . by comparing states . . .


It got reviewed . . . by three economists and all suggest that we run a fixed effects model.  We ran a hierarchial model in the paper that allow the intercept and slope to vary before and after . . . My question is which is correct? We have ran it both ways and really it makes no difference which model you run, the results are very similar. But for my own learning, I would really like to understand which to use under what circumstances.  Is the fact that we use the whole population reason enough to just run a fixed effect model?


Perhaps you can suggest a good reference to this question of when to run a fixed vs. random effects model.
  
I’m not always sure what is meant by a “fixed effects model”; see my paper on Anova for discussion of the problems with this terminology:

<p>Introduction: Jacob Hartog writes the following in reaction to  my post  on the use of value-added modeling for teacher assessment:
  
What I [Hartog] think has been inadequately discussed is the use of individual model specifications to assign these teacher ratings, rather than the zone of agreement across a broad swath of model specifications.


For example, the model used by NYCDOE doesn’t just control for a student’s prior year test score (as I think everyone can agree is a good idea.) It also assumes that different demographic groups will learn different amounts in a given year, and assigns a school-level random effect. The result is that, as was much ballyhooed at the time of the release of the data,the average teacher rating for a given school is roughly the same, no matter whether the school is performing great or terribly. The headline from this was “excellent teachers spread evenly across the city’s schools,” rather than “the specification of these models assume that excellent teachers are</p><p>5 0.20441678 <a title="1644-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-17-Hierarchical-multilevel_modeling_with_%E2%80%9Cbig_data%E2%80%9D.html">1267 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-17-Hierarchical-multilevel modeling with “big data”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
I make extensive use of random effects models in my academic and industry research, as they are very often appropriate.


However, with very large data sets, I am not sure what to do. Say I have thousands of levels of a grouping factor, and the number of observations totals in the billions. Despite having lots of observations, I am often either dealing with (a) small effects or (b) trying to fit models with many predictors.


So I would really like to use a random effects model to borrow strength across the levels of the grouping factor, but I am not sure how to practically do this. Are you aware of any approaches to fitting random effects models (including approximations) that work for very large data sets? For example, applying a procedure to each group, and then using the results of this to shrink each fit in some appropriate way.


Just to clarify, here I am only worried about the non-crossed and in fact single-level case.

<p>Introduction: Karri Seppa writes:
  
My topic is regional variation in the cause-specific survival of breast cancer patients across the 21 hospital districts in Finland, this component being modeled by random effects. I am interested mainly in the district-specific effects, and with a hierarchical model I can get reasonable estimates also for sparsely populated districts.


Based on the recommendation given in the book by yourself and Dr. Hill (2007) I tend to think that the finite-population variance would be an appropriate measure to summarize the overall variation across the 21 districts. However, I feel it is somewhat incoherent first to assume a Normal distribution for the district effects, involving a “superpopulation” variance parameter, and then to compute the finite-population variance from the estimated district-specific parameters. I wonder whether the finite-population variance were more appropriate in the context of a model with fixed district effects?

My colleague and I are trying to understand the best way to approach a problem involving measuring a group of individuals’ abilities across time, and are hoping you can offer some guidance.


We are trying to analyze the combined effect of two distinct groups of people (A and B, with no overlap between A and B) who collaborate to produce a binary outcome, using a mixed logistic regression along the lines of the following.


Outcome ~ (1 | A) + (1 | B) + Other variables


What we’re interested in testing was whether the observed A random effects in period  1 are predictive of the A random effects in the following period 2.  Our idea being create two models, each using a different period’s worth of data, to create two sets of A coefficients, then observe the relationship between the two.  If the A’s have a persistent ability across periods, the coefficients should be correlated or show a linear-ish relationshi</p><p>5 0.76900405 <a title="1644-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-One_way_that_psychology_research_is_different_than_medical_research.html">433 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-One way that psychology research is different than medical research</a></p>

I have a question about  fixed effects vs. random effects . Amongst economists who study teacher value-added, it has become common to see people saying that they estimated teacher fixed effects (via least squares dummy variables, so that there is a parameter for each teacher), but that they then applied empirical Bayes shrinkage so that the teacher effects are brought closer to the mean.  (See  this paper  by Jacob and Lefgren, for example.)


Can that really be what they are doing? Why wouldn’t they just run random (modeled) effects in the first place? I feel like there’s something I’m missing.
  
My reply:  I don’t know the full story here, but I’m thinking there are two goals, first to get an unbiased estimate of an overall treatment effect (and there the econometricians prefer so-called fixed effects; I disagree with them on this but I know where they’re coming from) and second to estimate individual teacher effects (and there it makes sense to use so-called</p><p>2 0.98593801 <a title="1644-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-05-What_is_a_prior_distribution%3F.html">1155 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-05-What is a prior distribution?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some recent blog discussion revealed some confusion that I’ll try to resolve here.
 
I  wrote  that I’m not a big fan of subjective priors.  Various commenters had difficulty with this point, and I think the issue was most clearly stated by Bill Jeff re erys, who  wrote :
  
It seems to me that your prior has to reflect your subjective information before you look at the data. How can it not?


But this does not mean that the (subjective) prior that you choose is irrefutable; Surely a prior that reflects prior information just does not have to be inconsistent with that information. But that still leaves a range of priors that are consistent with it, the sort of priors that one would use in a sensitivity analysis, for example.
  
I think I see what Bill is getting at.  A prior represents your subjective belief, or some approximation to your subjective belief, even if it’s not perfect.  That sounds reasonable but I don’t think it works.  Or, at least, it often doesn’t work.

 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics.  The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money.  But how do we know it’s not the reverse:  that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well.  As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true.  What I’d call the demand-side story (more spending leads to more output) is everywhere, including this piece, from the usually reliable David Leonhardt.
  
This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?

<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who wishes to remain anonymous:
  
My colleague and I are trying to understand the best way to approach a problem involving measuring a group of individuals’ abilities across time, and are hoping you can offer some guidance.


We are trying to analyze the combined effect of two distinct groups of people (A and B, with no overlap between A and B) who collaborate to produce a binary outcome, using a mixed logistic regression along the lines of the following.


Outcome ~ (1 | A) + (1 | B) + Other variables


What we’re interested in testing was whether the observed A random effects in period  1 are predictive of the A random effects in the following period 2.  Our idea being create two models, each using a different period’s worth of data, to create two sets of A coefficients, then observe the relationship between the two.  If the A’s have a persistent ability across periods, the coefficients should be correlated or show a linear-ish relationshi</p><p>5 0.98482084 <a title="1644-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-18-Understanding_posterior_p-values.html">2029 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-18-Understanding posterior p-values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Kaplan writes:
  
I came across your  paper  “Understanding Posterior Predictive P-values”, and I have a question regarding your statement “If a posterior predictive p-value is 0.4, say, that means that, if we believe the model, we think there is a 40% chance that tomorrow’s value of T(y_rep) will exceed today’s T(y).” This is perfectly understandable to me and represents the idea of calibration.  However, I am unsure how this relates to statements about fit.  If T is the LR chi-square or Pearson chi-square, then your statement that there is a 40% chance that tomorrows value exceeds today’s value indicates bad fit, I think.  Yet, some literature indicates that high p-values suggest good fit.  Could you clarify this?
  
My reply:
 
I think that “fit” depends on the question being asked.  In this case, I’d say the model fits for this particular purpose, even though it might not fit for other purposes.

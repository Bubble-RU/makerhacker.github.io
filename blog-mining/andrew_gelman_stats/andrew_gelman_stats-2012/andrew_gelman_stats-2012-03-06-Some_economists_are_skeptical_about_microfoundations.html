<p>Introduction: Joseph Delaney  quotes Frances Woolley:
  
In other words, the reason we care about inequality is that it reduces the happiness achievable from a given amount of income. How much depends upon the happiness/income relationship. Does the marginal utility of income fall rapidly? Or is the happiness from the 100,000th dollar almost as great as the happiness from the 100th?
  
Delaney goes on to discuss the marginal utility of income, but I have a different point to make.
 
Woolley is a professor of economics.

<p>Introduction: Hogg writes:
  
At the end  this article  you wonder about consistency.  Have you ever considered the possibility that utility might resolve some of the problems?  I have no idea if it 
would—I am not advocating that position—I just get some kind of intuition from phrases like “Judgment is required to decide…”. Perhaps there is a coherent and objective description of what is—or could be—done under a coherent “utility” model (like a utility that could be objectively agreed upon and computed).  Utilities are usually subjective—true—but priors are usually subjective too.
  
My reply:
 
I’m happy to think about utility, for some particular problem or class of problems going to the effort of assigning costs and benefits to different outcomes.  I agree that a utility analysis, even if (necessarily) imperfect, can usefully focus discussion.  For example, if a statistical method for selecting variables is justified on the basis of cost, I like the idea of attempting to quantify the costs of ga</p><p>4 0.26764345 <a title="1200-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-08-The_politics_of_economic_and_statistical_models.html">1204 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-08-The politics of economic and statistical models</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A colleague emailed me with a question about the methods used by  Groseclose and Milyo  in their study of media bias.
 
Before getting to the question, I just wanted to comment that Groseclose has had really bad timing with this project.
 
First off, his article came out in 2005 when everybody was hating Bush.  Even the Republicans who reelected him weren’t thrilled with the guy.  Then his book came out in 2011.  If his book had come out a year ago, that would’ve been perfect:  the 2010 elections coming up, lots of anger at the Democrats and Obama, no peer-reviewed criticisms of his work, etc.  Instead he waited until 2011, and then look what he got:
 
- Republicans feel they have a chance at winning in 2012 so they’re more interested in fighting and less interested in complaining.
 
- John Gasper  shoots down  Groseclose/Milyo in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science.  That’s gotta hurt.  (Until this point, Groseclose could respond to attacks by saying he was waiting until a crit</p><p>6 0.18885492 <a title="1200-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-29-Ken_Rice_presents_a_unifying_approach_to_statistical_inference_and_hypothesis_testing.html">2312 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-29-Ken Rice presents a unifying approach to statistical inference and hypothesis testing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi writes the above in a  discussion  of a misunderstanding of the economics of Keynes.
 
The discussion is interesting.  According to Sethi, Keynes wrote that, in a depression, nominal wages might be sticky but in any case a decline in wages would not do the trick to increase hiring.  But many modern economics writers have missed this. For example, Gary Becker writes, “Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in the downward direction. . . . A fall in price stimulates demand and reduces supply until they are brought back to rough equality.”  Whether Becker is empirically correct is another story, but in any case he is misinterpreting Keynes.
 
But the actual reason I’m posting here is in reaction to Sethi’s remark quoted in the title above, in which he endorses a 1975 paper by James Tobin on wages and employment but remarks that Tobin’s paper did not include the individual-level de</p><p>3 0.81759685 <a title="1200-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-Economists_don%E2%80%99t_think_like_accountants%E2%80%94but_maybe_they_should.html">922 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-Economists don’t think like accountants—but maybe they should</a></p>

Given your past criticisms of this issue in your posts, I do not think you will like  my co-authored paper , “Microfoundations of the Business Cycle and Monetary Shocks” . . .
  
Given this lead-in, of course I had to take a look.  The paper is by James Holmes, John Holmes, and Patricia Hutton, it’s called “Microfoundations of the Business Cycle and Monetary Shocks,” and they say:
  
Non-rational expectations can produce larger expected real income for some or all agents than rational expectations. . . . Hence, “rational expectations” are not rational, and “money illusion” can be optimal and satisfy the “Lucas Critique.” . . . Nominal wage rigidity or stickiness can be the rational response of firms or workers and need not be evidence of money illusion.
  
I asked Holmes why he thought I would not like the paper, as I am not opposed to microfoundations when they are of interest.  My  opposition  is to the attitude that microfoundations a</p><p>6 0.74150962 <a title="1200-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-24-Non-Bayesian_analysis_of_Bayesian_agents%3F.html">1280 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-24-Non-Bayesian analysis of Bayesian agents?</a></p>

April 27, 4:10-5 p.m., 1011 Evans Hall
 
I will deliver  one  of the following three talks: 
1.  Of beauty, sex, and power: Statistical challenges in estimating small effects  
2.  Why we (usually) don’t worry about multiple comparisons  
3.  Parameterization and Bayesian modeling  
Whoever shows up on time to the seminar gets to vote, and I’ll give the talk that gets the most votes.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89357328 <a title="1200-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-06-Some_economists_are_skeptical_about_microfoundations.html">1200 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-06-Some economists are skeptical about microfoundations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.
 
P.S.  Perhaps this will clarify:  In a typical economics research pap</p><p>5 0.87873936 <a title="1200-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-24-Trends_in_partisanship_by_state.html">536 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-24-Trends in partisanship by state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

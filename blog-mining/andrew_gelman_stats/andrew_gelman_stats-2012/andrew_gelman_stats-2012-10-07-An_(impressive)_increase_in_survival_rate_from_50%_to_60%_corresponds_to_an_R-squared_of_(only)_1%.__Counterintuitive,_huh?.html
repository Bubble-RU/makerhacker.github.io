I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>3 0.16212389 <a title="1524-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-21-Avoiding_boundary_estimates_in_linear_mixed_models.html">918 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-21-Avoiding boundary estimates in linear mixed models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pablo Verde sends in  this letter  he and Daniel Curcio just published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. They had published a meta-analysis with a boundary estimate which, he said, gave nonsense results.  Here’s Curcio and Verde’s key paragraph:
  
The authors [of the study they are criticizing] performed a test of heterogeneity between studies. Given that the test result was not significant at 5%, they decided to pool all the RRs by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in meta-analysis, which usually leads to very misleading results. First of all, the pooled RR as well as its standard	error are sensitive to 2 the estimation of the between-studies standard deviation (SD).	SD is difficult to estimate with a small number of studies. On the other hand, it is very well known that the significant test of hetero- geneity lacks statistical power to detect values of SD greater than zero.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday we had a spirited  discussion  of the following conditional probability puzzle:
  
“I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”
  
This reminded me of the principle, familiar from  statistics instruction  and the  cognitive psychology  literature, that the best way to teach these sorts of examples is through integers rather than fractions.
 
For example, consider this classic problem:
  
“10% of persons have disease X.  You are tested for the disease and test positive, and the test has 80% accuracy.  What is the probability that you have the disease?”
  
This can be solved directly using conditional probability but it appears to be clearer to do it using integers:
  
Start with 100 people.  10 will have the disease and 90 will not.  Of the 10 with the disease, 8 will test positive and 2 will test negative.  Of the 90 without the disease, 18 will test positive and 72% will test negative.  (72% = 0.8*90.)

<p>Introduction: Alexander at GiveWell  writes :
  
The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43.

<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.

<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example.

<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).

<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>2 0.96417826 <a title="1524-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-12-%E2%80%9CA_tangle_of_unexamined_emotional_impulses_and_illogical_responses%E2%80%9D.html">1935 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-12-“A tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.
 
I’m guessing that the taxi driver quoted above is subject to the same illusions</p><p>3 0.95656788 <a title="1524-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-21-%E2%80%9CReadability%E2%80%9D_as_freedom_from_the_actual_sensation_of_reading.html">1179 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-21-“Readability” as freedom from the actual sensation of reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

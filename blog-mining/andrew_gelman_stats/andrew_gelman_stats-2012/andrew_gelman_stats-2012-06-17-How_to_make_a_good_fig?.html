<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein writes:
  
I know you’ve discussed this on your blog in the past, but I don’t know exactly how you’d answer the following query:


Suppose you run an analysis and obtain a p-value of 10^-300.  What would you actually report?  I’m fairly confident that I’m not that confident :) I’m guessing: “p-value \approx 0.”


One possibility is to determine the accuracy with this one *could* in theory know, by virtue of the sample size, and say that p-value is less than or equal to that?  For example, if I used a Monte Carlo approach to generate the null distribution with 10,000 samples, and I found that the observed value was more extreme than all of the sample values, then I might say that p is less than or equal to 1/10,000.

  
My reply:  Mosteller and Wallace talked a bit about this in their book, the idea that there are various other 1-in-a-million possibilities (for example, the data were faked somewhere before they got to you) so p-values such as 10^-6 don’t really mean an</p><p>4 0.11273876 <a title="1382-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-28-New_book_by_Stef_van_Buuren_on_missing-data_imputation_looks_really_good%21.html">1642 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-28-New book by Stef van Buuren on missing-data imputation looks really good!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben points us to a new book,  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data .  It’s excellent and I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth the $89.95.  Van Buuren’s book is great even if you don’t end up using the algorithm described in the book (I actually like their approach but I do think there are some limitations with their particular implementation, which is one reason we’re developing our own  package ); he supplies lots of intuition, examples, and graphs. 
   
P.S.  Stef’s book features an introduction by Don Rubin, which gets me thinking:  if Don can find the time to write an introduction to somebody else’s book, he surely should be willing to read and comment on the third edition of his own book, no?</p><p>5 0.10408382 <a title="1382-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Fun_fight_over_the_Grover_search_algorithm.html">1120 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Fun fight over the Grover search algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points me to  this  blog entry by Robert Tucci, diplomatically titled “Unethical or Really Dumb (or both) Scientists from University of Adelaide ‘Rediscover’ My Version of Grover’s Algorithm”: 
  
  
The Chappell et al. paper has 24 references but does not refer to my paper, even though their paper and mine are eerily similar. Compare them yourself. With the excellent Google and ArXiv search engines, I [Tucci] would say there is zero probability that none of its five authors knew about my paper before they wrote theirs.
  
Chappell  responds  in the comments:
  
Your paper is timestamped 2010; however the results of our paper was initially presented at the Cairns CQIQC conference in July 2008. . . . The intention of our paper is not a research article. It is a tutorial paper. . . . We had not seen your paper before. Our paper is based on the standard Grover search, not a fixed point search.

The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.

There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.

I’ve only looked at the website, not the book itself, and I’m sure I’d find lots of places to disagree with it on details, but the general flow seemed reasonable, also I liked that there’s lots of course materials to go with it.

<p>Introduction: Much-honored playwright Tony Kushner was set to receive one more honor–a degree from John Jay College–but it was suddenly  taken away  from him on an 11-1 vote of the trustees  of the City University of New York.  This was the first rejection of an honorary degree nomination since 1961.
 
The news article focuses on one trustee, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment adviser and onetime political aide, who opposed Kushner’s honorary degree, but to me the relevant point is that the committee as a whole voted 11-1 to ding him.
 
Kusnher said, “I’m sickened,” he added, “that this is happening in New York City. Shocked, really.”  I can see why he’s shocked, but perhaps it’s not so surprising that it’s happening in NYC.  Recall the famous incident from 1940 in which Bertrand Russell was invited and then uninvited to teach at City College.  The problem that time was Russell’s views on free love (as they called it back then).  There seems to be a long tradition of city college officials being will</p><p>3 0.91514689 <a title="1382-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-22-Researching_the_cost-effectiveness_of_political_lobbying_organisations.html">969 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-22-Researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.


We’ve a great deal of respect for your work and the superbly rational way you go about it, and</p><p>4 0.91137755 <a title="1382-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-18-Should_kids_be_able_to_bring_their_own_lunches_to_school%3F.html">718 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-18-Should kids be able to bring their own lunches to school?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I encountered this  news article , “Chicago school bans some lunches brought from home”:
  
At Little Village, most students must take the meals served in the cafeteria or go hungry or both. . . . students are not allowed to pack lunches from home. Unless they have a medical excuse, they must eat the food served in the cafeteria. . . . Such discussions over school lunches and healthy eating echo a larger national debate about the role government should play in individual food choices.  “This is such a fundamental infringement on parental responsibility,” said J. Justin Wilson, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Center for Consumer Freedom, which is partially funded by the food industry. . . . For many CPS parents, the idea of forbidding home-packed lunches would be unthinkable. . . . 
  
If I had read this two years ago, I’d be at one with J. Justin Wilson and the outraged kids and parents.  But last year we spent a sabbatical in Paris, where . . . kids aren’t allowed to bring</p><p>5 0.90653968 <a title="1382-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-04-What_are_the_key_assumptions_of_linear_regression%3F.html">1967 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-04-What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andy Cooper writes:
  
A link to an  article , “Four Assumptions Of Multiple Regression That Researchers Should Always Test”, has been making  the rounds  on Twitter.  Their first rule is “Variables are Normally distributed.”  And they seem to be talking about the independent variables – but then later bring in tests on the residuals (while admitting that the normally-distributed error assumption is a weak assumption).  


I thought we had long-since moved away from transforming our independent variables to make them normally distributed for statistical reasons (as opposed to standardizing them for interpretability, etc.)  Am I missing something?  I agree that leverage in a influence is important, but normality of the variables? The article is from 2002, so it might be dated, but given the popularity of the tweet, I thought I’d ask your opinion.
  
My response:  There’s some useful advice on that page but overall I think the advice was dated even in 2002.

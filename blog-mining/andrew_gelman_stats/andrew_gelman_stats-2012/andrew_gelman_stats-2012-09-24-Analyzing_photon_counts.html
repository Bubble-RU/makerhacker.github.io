<p>Introduction: Yajuan Si, Natesh Pillai, and I  write :
  
It has historically been a challenge to perform Bayesian inference in a design-based survey context. The present paper develops a Bayesian model for sampling inference using inverse-probability weights. We use a hierarchical approach in which we model the distribution of the weights of the nonsampled units in the population and simultaneously include them as predictors in a nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We use simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our procedure and compare it to the classical design-based estimator. We apply our method to the Fragile Family Child Wellbeing Study. Our studies find the Bayesian nonparametric finite population estimator to be more robust than the classical design-based estimator without loss in efficiency.

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights.

<p>Introduction: Mike McLaughlin writes:
  
Consider the Seeds example in vol. 1 of the BUGS examples.  There, a binomial likelihood has a p parameter constructed, via logit, from two covariates.  What I am wondering is: Would it be legitimate, in a binomial + logit problem like this, to allow binomial p[i] to be a function of the corresponding n[i] or would that amount to using the data in the prior?  In other words, in the context of the Seeds example, is r[] the only data or is n[] data as well and therefore not permissible in a prior formulation?


I [McLaughlin] currently have a model with a common beta prior for all p[i] but would like to mitigate this commonality (a kind of James-Stein effect) when there are lots of observations for some i.  But this seems to feed the data back into the prior.  Does it really?


It also occurs to me [McLaughlin] that, perhaps, a binomial likelihood is not the one to use here (not flexible enough).

<p>Introduction: Ilya Esteban writes:
  
In traditional machine learning and statistical learning techniques, you spend a lot of time selecting your input features, fiddling with model parameter values, etc., all of which leads to the problem of overfitting the data and producing overly optimistic estimates for how good the model really is. You can use techniques such as cross-validation and out-of-sample validation data to try to limit the damage, but they are imperfect solutions at best.


While Bayesian models have the great advantage of not forcing you to manually select among the various weights and input features, you still often end up trying different priors and model structures (especially with hierarchical models), before coming up with a “final” model. When applying Bayesian modeling to real world data sets, how does should you evaluate alternate priors and topologies for the model without falling into the same overfitting trap as you do with non-Bayesian models?

<p>Introduction: John Cook  considers  how people justify probability distribution assumptions:
  
Sometimes distribution assumptions are not justified.


Sometimes distributions can be derived from fundamental principles [or] . . . on theoretical grounds. For example, large samples and the central limit theorem together may justify assuming that something is normally distributed.


Often the choice of distribution is somewhat arbitrary, chosen by intuition or for convenience, and then empirically shown to work well enough.


Sometimes a distribution can be a bad fit and still work well, depending on what you’re asking of it.
  
Cook continues:
  
The last point is particularly interesting. It’s not hard to imagine that a poor fit would produce poor results. It’s surprising when a poor fit produces good results.
  
And then he gives an example of an effective but inaccurate model used to model survival times in a clinical trial.  Cook explains:

<p>Introduction: Steve Peterson writes:
  
I recently submitted a proposal on applying a Bayesian analysis to gender comparisons on motivational constructs. I had an idea on how to improve the model I used and was hoping you could give me some feedback.


The data come from a survey based on 5-point Likert scales. Different constructs are measured for each student as scores derived from averaging a student’s responses on particular subsets of survey questions. (I suppose it is not uncontroversial to treat these scores as interval measures and would be interested to hear if you have any objections.) I am comparing genders on each construct. Researchers typically use t-tests to do so.


To use a Bayesian approach I applied the programs written in R and JAGS by John Kruschke for estimating the difference of means:

<p>Introduction: Shravan writes:
  
I have a problem very similar to the one presented chapter 6 of BDA, the speed of light example. You use the distribution of the minimum scores from the posterior predictive distribution, show that it’s not realistic given the data, and suggest that an asymmetric contaminated normal distribution or a symmetric long-tailed distribution would be better.


How does one use such a distribution?
  
My reply:
 
You can actually use a symmetric long-tailed distribution such as t with low degrees of freedom.  One striking feature of symmetric long-tailed distributions is that a small random sample from such a distribution can have outliers on one side or the other and look asymmetric.
 
Just to see this, try the following in R: 
  
par (mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1)) 
for (i in 1:9) hist (rt (100, 2), xlab="", ylab="", main="")

<p>Introduction: Michael McLaughlin sent me the following query with the above title.
  
Some time ago, I [McLaughlin] was handed a dataset that needed to be modeled.  It was generated as follows:


1. Random navigation errors, historically a binary mixture of normal and Laplace with a common mean, were collected by observation.


2. Sadly, these data were recorded with too few decimal places so that the resulting quantization is clearly visible in a scatterplot.


3. The quantized data were then interpolated (to an unobserved location).


The final result looks like fuzzy points (small scale jitter) at quantized intervals spanning a much larger scale (the parent mixture distribution).  This fuzziness, likely ~normal or ~Laplace, results from the interpolation.  Otherwise, the data would look like a discrete analogue of the normal/Laplace mixture.


I would like to characterize the latent normal/Laplace mixture distribution but the quantization is “getting in the way”.

In general, is there any way to do MCMC with a fixed constraint?


E.g., suppose I measure the three internal angles of a triangle with errors ~dnorm(0, tau) where tau might be different for the three measurements.  This would be an easy BUGS/WinBUGS/JAGS exercise but suppose, in addition, I wanted to include prior information to the effect that the three angles had to total 180 degrees exactly.


Is this feasible? Could you point me to any BUGS model in which a constraint of this type is implemented?


Note: Even in my own (non-hierarchical) code which tends to be component-wise, random-walk Metropolis with tuned Laplacian proposals, I cannot see how I could incorporate such a constraint.
  
My reply:  See page 508 of Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd edition).  We have an example of such a model there (from  this paper  with Bois and Jiang).</p><p>2 0.92212737 <a title="1509-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-I_like_lineplots.html">800 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-I like lineplots</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

My labmates have statistics problem. We are all experimentalists, but need an input on a fine statistics point.


The problem is as follows. The data set consists of photon counts measured at a series of coordinates. The number of input photons is known, but the system transmission (T) is not known and needs to be estimated. The number of transmitted photons at each coordinate follows a binomial distribution, not a Gaussian one.


The spatial distribution of T values it then fit using a Levenberg-Marquart method modified to use weights for each data point.


At present, my labmates are not sure how to properly calculate and use the weights. The equations are designed for Gaussian distributions, not binomial ones, and this is a problem because in many cases the photon counts are near the edge (say, zero), where a Gaussian width is nonsensical.


Could you recommend a source they could use to guide their calculations?

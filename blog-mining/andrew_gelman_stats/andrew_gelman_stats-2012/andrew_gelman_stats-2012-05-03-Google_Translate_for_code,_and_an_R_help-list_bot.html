<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>3 0.14710245 <a title="1296-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual 
 
If you’d like to learn more, the   Stan User’s Guide and Reference Manual   is the place to start.</p><p>4 0.13825229 <a title="1296-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-21-The_world%E2%80%99s_most_popular_languages_that_the_Mac_documentation_hasn%E2%80%99t_been_translated_into.html">2219 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-21-The world’s most popular languages that the Mac documentation hasn’t been translated into</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was updating my Mac and noticed the following:
 
 
 
Lots of obscure European languages there.  That got me wondering:  what’s the least obscure language  not  on the above list?  Igbo?  Swahili?  Or maybe Tagalog?
 
I did a quick google and found  this  list of languages by number of native speakers.  Once you see the list, the answer is obvious:  Hindi, first language of 295 million people, is not on Apple’s list.  The next most popular languages not included:  Bengali, Punjabi, Javanese, Wu, Telegu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu.  Wow:  most of these are Indian!  Then comes Persian and a bunch of others.
 
It turns out that Tagalog, Igbo, and Swahili, are way down on this list with 28 million, 24 million, and 26 million native speakers, respectively.
 
Only 26 million for Swahili?  This made me want to check the  list of languages by total number of speakers .  The ranking of most of the languages isn’t much different, but Swahili is now #10, at 140 million.  Hindi and Bengali are still th</p><p>5 0.11613871 <a title="1296-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-05-Stan_%28quietly%29_passes_512_people_on_the_users_list.html">2124 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-05-Stan (quietly) passes 512 people on the users list</a></p>

The tutorial’s aimed at psycholinguists in particular and cognitive psychologists more generally, but it’s clear enough to be understood by anyone.  Plus, the psycholinguistic data is a lot of fun.
 
There’s contact info on the tutorial itself if you want to send the authors feedback directly.

<p>Introduction: Richard McElreath writes:
  
I’ve been translating a few ongoing data analysis projects into  Stan  code, mostly with success. The most important for me right now has been a hierarchical zero-inflated gamma problem. This a “hurdle” model, in which a bernoulli GLM produces zeros/nonzeros, and then a gamma GLM produces the nonzero values, using varying effects correlated with those in the bernoulli process.


The data are 20 years of human foraging returns from a subsistence hunting population in Paraguay (the Ache), comprising about 15k hunts in total (Hill & Kintigh. 2009. Current Anthropology 50:369-377). Observed values are kilograms of meat returned to camp. The more complex models contain a 147-by-9 matrix of varying effects (147 unique hunters), as well as imputation of missing values.


Originally, I had written the sampler myself in raw R code. It was very slow, but I knew what it was doing at least.

  Workshop on Probabilistic Programming  
NIPS 2012 
7–8 December, 2012, Lake Tahoe, Nevada
   
The workshop is organized by the folks behind the probabilistic programming language  Church  and has a great lineup of invited speakers (Chris Bishop, Josh Tennenbaum, and Stuart Russell).  And in case you’re interested in the main conference, here’s the list of accepted  NIPS 2012 papers and posters .

<p>Introduction: At Picnic Cafe, Broadway at 101 St, 6-7pm today.
  
Should we vote even though it probably won’t make a difference? Why is the question “Are we better off now than four years ago?” not an appeal to selfishness? Are Americans as polarized as we think? Come explore these and other questions about voting in America today.
  
It’s the usual stuff but close-up so lots of opportunity to argue and heckle.  No slides or graphs.  My plan is to hand out 30-50 index cards, each with a phrase (for example, “Moderation in the pursuit of moderation is no vice” or “Gerrymandering is good for you” or “How to predict elections”), then participants can call out topics and I’ll yap on them (with discussion) till we run out of time.
 
It’ll be weird to talk without graphs.  We’ll see how it goes.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93900895 <a title="1296-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-03-Google_Translate_for_code%2C_and_an_R_help-list_bot.html">1296 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-03-Google Translate for code, and an R help-list bot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What we did in our Stan meeting yesterday:
 
Some discussion of revision of the Nuts paper, some conversations about parameterizations of categorical-data models, plans for the R interface, blah blah blah.
 
But also, I had two exciting new ideas!
 
 Google Translate for code 
 
Wouldn’t it be great if Google Translate could work on computer languages?  I suggested this and somebody said that it might be a problem because code isn’t always translatable.  But that doesn’t worry so much.  Google Translate for human languages isn’t perfect either but it’s a useful guide.  If I want to write a message to someone in French or Spanish or Dutch, I wouldn’t just write it in English and run it through Translate.  What I do is try my best to write it in the desired language, but I can try out some tricky words or phrases in the translator.  Or, if I start by translating, I go back and forth to make sure it all makes sense.

<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Stephen Senn, “You May Believe You Are a Bayesian But You Are Probably Wrong”:
 
I agree with Senn’s comments on the impossibility of the de Finetti subjective Bayesian approach.  As I wrote in 2008, if you could really construct a subjective prior you believe in, why not just look at the data and write down your subjective posterior.  The immense practical difficulties with  any  serious system of inference render it absurd to think that it would be possible to just write down a probability distribution to represent uncertainty.  I wish, however, that Senn would recognize  my  Bayesian approach (which is also that of John Carlin, Hal Stern, Don Rubin, and, I believe, others).  De Finetti is no longer around, but we are!
 
I have to admit that my own Bayesian views and practices have changed.  In particular, I resonate wit</p><p>4 0.90962088 <a title="1296-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-16-There%E2%80%99s_no_need_for_you_to_read_this_one.html">2213 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-16-There’s no need for you to read this one</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had an email exchange with Patrick Steigler the other day that amused me, so I’ll share it with you.
 
Steigler started with the subject line “Taleb and STDEV vs. MAD” and the message:  I came across http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25401 and was wondering what your thoughts on the issue might be. 
 
My reply:  How come they never ask me for my opinions in these surveys?
 
Steigler:  Maybe you need to write a book of aphorisms.
 
me:  There’s this:

and then this, which some students collected from a course I taught:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/gelman_quotes.pdf
 
Steigler:  So, what would you opinion be on the scientific idea that is ready for retirement?
 
me:  I guess it’s a good thing they didn’t ask me!
 
Steigler:  How about the retirement of p value < .05 for significance?
 
me:  Yeah, but that’s too easy.  It’s like if someone asks for a pop music recommendation and you say The Beatles.

<p>Introduction: From a commenter on the web, 21 May 2010:
  
Tampa Bay:  Playing .732 ball in the toughest division in baseball, wiped their feet on NY twice.  If they sweep Houston, which seems pretty likely, they will be at .750, which I [the commenter] have never heard of. 
  
At the time of that posting, the Rays were 30-11.  Quick calculation:  if a team is good enough to be expected to win 100 games, that is, Pr(win) = 100/162 = .617, then there’s a 5% chance that they’ll have won at least 30 of their first 41 games.  That’s a calculation based on simple probability theory of independent events, which isn’t quite right here but will get you close and is a good way to  train one’s intuition , I think.
 
Having a .732 record after 41 games is not unheard-of.  The Detroit Tigers won 35 of their first 40 games in 1984:  that’s .875.  (I happen to remember that fast start, having been an Orioles fan at the time.)

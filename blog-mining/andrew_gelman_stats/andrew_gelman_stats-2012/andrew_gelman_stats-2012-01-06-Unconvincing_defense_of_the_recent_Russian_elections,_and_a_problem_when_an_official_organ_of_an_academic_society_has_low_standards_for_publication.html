<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.107333 <a title="1103-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-The_Tweets-Votes_Curve.html">1823 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-The Tweets-Votes Curve</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas points me to  this excellently-titled working paper  by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen, and himself:
  
Is social media a valid indicator of political behavior? We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion. With over 500 million active users in 2012, Twitter now represents a new frontier for the study of human behavior. This research provides a framework for incorporating this emerging medium into the computational social science toolkit.

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>5 0.095262676 <a title="1103-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-Forecasting_2012%3A_How_much_does_ideology_matter%3F.html">1000 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-Forecasting 2012: How much does ideology matter?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery talk sense  here .  I am perhaps too influenced by Steven Rosenstoneâ&euro;&trade;s 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections, which is the first thing I read on the topic.  In any case, I agree with Nyhan and Montgomery that the difference in vote, comparing a centrist candidate to an extreme candidate, is probably on the order of 1-2%, not the 4% that has been posited by some.
 
Among other things, ideological differences between candidates of the same party might seem big in the primaries, but then when the general election comes along, party ID becomes more important.
 
I also disagree with the model in which presidential elections are like votes for high school  prom king .</p><p>6 0.094318211 <a title="1103-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan_Chait_and_I_agree_about_the_importance_of_the_fundamentals_in_determining_presidential_elections.html">656 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan Chait and I agree about the importance of the fundamentals in determining presidential elections</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Johathan Chait  writes :
  
 Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. 
  
I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstone’s excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on “The G.O.P.’s Dukakis Problem”?
 
I’ll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that I’m happy with Chait’s quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where I’m coming from but my take-home point is that we’re mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog comments made me rethink how to express disagreement when I write.  I’ll first display my original blog entry, then some of the comments, then my reaction, and finally my new approach.  As usual with negative comments, my first reaction was to be upset, but once the hurt feelings went away, I realized that these dudes had a point.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Chait  writes  that the most important aspect of a presidential candidate is “political talent”:
  
Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America. Favorite character types include jocks, movie stars, folksy Texans and war heroes. . . . [But the frontrunners for the 2012 Republican nomination] make Michael Dukakis look like John F. Kennedy. They are qualified enough to serve as president, but wildly unqualified to run for president. . . . [Mitch] Daniels’s drawbacks begin — but by no means end — with his lack of height, hair and charisma. . . . [Jeb Bush] suffers from an inherent branding challenge [because of his last name]. . . . [Chris] Christie . . . doesn’t cut a trim figure and who specializes in verbally abusing his constituents. . . .  [Haley] Barbour is the comic embodiment of his party’s most negative stereotypes. A Barbour nomination would be the rough equivalent</p><p>6 0.77222908 <a title="1103-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff, Justin, and I  write :
  
Gay marriage is not going away as a highly emotional, contested issue. Proposition 8, the California ballot measure that bans same-sex marriage, has seen to that, as it winds its way through the federal courts.  But perhaps the public has reached a turning point.

<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

<p>Introduction: Frank Wood and Nick Bartlett  write :
  
Deplump works the same as all probabilistic lossless compressors. A datastream is fed one observation at a time into a predictor which emits both the data stream and predictions about what the next observation in the stream should be for every observation. An encoder takes this output and produces a compressed stream which can be piped over a network or to a file. A receiver then takes this stream and decompresses it by doing everything in reverse. In order to ensure that the decoder has the same information available to it that the encoder had when compressing the stream, the decoded datastream is both emitted and directed to another predictor. This second predictor’s job is to produce exactly the same predictions as the initial predictor so that the decoder has the same information at every step of the process as the encoder did.


The difference between probabilistic lossless compressors is in the prediction engine, encoding and decoding bein</p><p>5 0.94087309 <a title="1103-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-17-Yes%2C_your_wish_shall_be_granted_%28in_25_years%29.html">665 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-17-Yes, your wish shall be granted (in 25 years)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one  was so beautiful I just had to repost it:
 
From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

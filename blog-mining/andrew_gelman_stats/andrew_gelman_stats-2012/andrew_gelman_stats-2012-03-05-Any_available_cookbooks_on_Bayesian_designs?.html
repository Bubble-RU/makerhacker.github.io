<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>3 0.13952053 <a title="1199-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-13-More_Bell_Labs_happy_talk.html">1670 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-13-More Bell Labs happy talk</a></p>

I just read your  review  of Gertnerâ&euro;&trade;s book.  I agree with most of what you say re Bell labs.


I worked in the research area from 1964 to 1992 having arrived in what I regarded as a sort of heaven after 10 years in industrial research elsewhere. For much of that time I headed the Materials Science Research Dept. in the Solid State Electronics Laboratory. For a large number of the senior staff the eight hour day was the exception, not the rule, and even on weekends the parking lot was often 1/4 full. Most of the people I worked with were self driven and loved their work and the opportunities the Labs. provided to be maximally scientifically productive. Even during lunch in the cafeteria productive interactions were a common occurrence. I could go on and on, but just wanted to thank you for bring back pleasant memories of a long and productive career at Bell Labs after 20 years in retirement.

Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>6 0.096776918 <a title="1199-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-22-Quickies.html">2220 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-22-Quickies</a></p>

I saw  this post and response  from about 5 years ago, regarding a fellow analyzing levels of white blood cells.


He was asking about Bayesian approaches to quality control and couldn’t find a canonical resource on that topic. Five years on and I similarly don’t see many good resources on the topic, though it seems like a useful application of Bayesian analysis. Just wondering if you have any further thoughts on the matter now after a few years.


In my searching, I did find  this interesting book  on Bayesian Reliability.  It’s not quality control, of course, but it does seem that failure prediction and risk analysis have some bearing on quality control and process control. And the cited reviews are very positive. It was written by some researchers at Los Alamos.


Also an edited  book  on process control:  I saw that Bill Bolstad gives it a positive review in one of the journals. And a  book  on Bayesian risk analysis.</p><p>3 0.77728158 <a title="1199-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-05-A_locally_organized_online_BDA_course_on_G%2B_hangout%3F.html">2009 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-05-A locally organized online BDA course on G+ hangout?</a></p>

I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.

I’ve seen some Bayes related things recently that might make for interesting fodder on your blog.


There are two books, teaching Bayesian analysis from a programming perspective.


And also a “web application for data analysis using powerful Bayesian statistical methods.”
  
   
I took a look.  The first book is  Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics Made Simple, by Allen B. Downey .  It’s super readable and, amazingly, has approximately zero overlap with Bayesian Data Analysis.  Downey discusses lots of little problems in a conversational way.  In some ways it’s like an old-style math stat textbook (although with a programming rather than mathematical flavor) in that the examples are designed for simplicity rather than realism.  I like it!  Our book already exists; it’s good to have something else for people to read, coming from an entirely different perspective.

P.S.  I don’t make any money through this link.  We do get some royalties from the book, but only a very small amount.  I’m pushing the Amazon link right now because (a) I think the book is great, and I want as many people as possible to have it, and (b) 40% off is a pretty good deal and I don’t know how long this will last.

<p>Introduction: As we get more data, we can fit more model.  But at some point we become so overwhelmed by data that, for computational reasons, we can barely do anything at all.  Thus, the curve above could be thought of as the product of two curves:  a steadily increasing curve showing the  statistical  ability to fit more complex models with more data, and a steadily decreasing curve showing the  computational  feasibility of doing so.</p><p>2 0.93783587 <a title="1199-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-28-My_talk_on_statistical_graphics_at_Mit_this_Thurs_aft.html">1594 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-28-My talk on statistical graphics at Mit this Thurs aft</a></p>

The importance of graphical displays in statistical practice has been recognized sporadically in the statistical literature over the past century, with wider awareness following Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis (1977) and Tufte’s books in the succeeding decades. But statistical graphics still occupies an awkward in-between position: Within statistics, exploratory and graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well-integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) is huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statisti</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92723691 <a title="1199-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-05-Any_available_cookbooks_on_Bayesian_designs%3F.html">1199 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-05-Any available cookbooks on Bayesian designs?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bell writes:
  
I [Bell] just finished “The Emperor of All Maladies” from 2010. One of the sections is captioned with the “In God we trust, all others bring data” quote which is supposedly from Deming. If you haven’t read it, I think you might like it even though the topic is pretty morbid (i.e. cancer).


I was rereading chapter 7 in Bayesian Data Analysis. While the principles there would allow me to “roll my own”, I was wondering whether or not there is now a comprehensive “cookbook” out there that gathers together such analyses for a variety of experimental designs – sort of a Bayesian equivalent to Montgomery’s “Design and Analysis of Experiments”.
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know, but now I’m thinking we should put some of this in our forthcoming book, Statistics for Psychology Research.  In the meantime, if anyone has any suggestions, feel free to post them in comments.</p><p>4 0.91999584 <a title="1199-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-27-The_M%C3%B6bius_strip%2C_or%2C_marketing_that_is_impervious_to_criticism.html">1641 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-27-The Möbius strip, or, marketing that is impervious to criticism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Johnny Carson had this great trick where, after a joke bombed, he’d do such a good double-take that he’d end up getting a huge laugh.  This gimmick could never have worked as his sole shtick—at some point, Johnny had to tell some good jokes—but it was a reliable way to limit the downside.  For the purpose of our discussion here, the point is that, even when the joke failed, Carson had a way out.
 
I thought of this today after following a link from a commenter that led to  this blog  on publicity-minded author Tim Ferriss.  I’ve never read anything by Ferriss but I’ve read about him on occasion:  his gimmick is he promotes his book using ingenious marketing strategies.  Sort of like how Madonna is famous for being famous, and Paris Hilton is famous for being famous for being famous, Ferriss is famous for self-promotion.

 Robert Zubrin  writes in  “How Much Is an Astronaut’s Life Worth?”  ( Reason ,  Feb 2012 ):
     
…policy analyst John D. Graham and his colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found in 1997 that the median cost for lifesaving expenditures and regulations by the U.S. government in the health care, residential, transportation, and occupational areas ranges from about $1 million to $3 million spent per life saved in today’s dollars. The only marked exception to this pattern occurs in the area of environmental health protection (such as the Superfund program) which costs about $200 million per life saved.


Graham and his colleagues call the latter kind of inefficiency “ statistical murder ,” since thousands of additional lives could be saved each year if the money were used more cost-effectively. To avoid such deadly waste, the Department of Transportation has a policy of rejecting any proposed safety expenditure that costs more than $3</p><p>6 0.87472737 <a title="1199-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-10-Who%E2%80%99s_holding_the_pen%3F%2C_The_split_screen%2C_and_other_ideas_for_one-on-one_instruction.html">462 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-10-Who’s holding the pen?, The split screen, and other ideas for one-on-one instruction</a></p>

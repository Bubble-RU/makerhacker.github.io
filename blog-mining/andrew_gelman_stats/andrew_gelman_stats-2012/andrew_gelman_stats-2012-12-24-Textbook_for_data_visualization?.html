<p>Introduction: Choices in Visualizing Data 
 
This time, it’s not at the university, it’s at a data science meetup.   Here are the slides .
 
I actually prefer the term “statistical graphics” or “visualizing quantitative information” rather than “visualizing data.”  I spend a lot of time graphing inferences and fitted models, understanding my fits and doing exploratory model analysis.  Graphs aren’t just for raw data.
 
P.S.  Mike Stringer, who prepared the blurb for my talk at the above link, wrote that ARM “has the most understandable description of causal inference I’ve ever read.”  I appreciate the compliment, but, to be fair, Jennifer deserves most of the credit for the  causal chapters  of that book.</p><p>3 0.14546852 <a title="1637-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-18-DataMarket.html">215 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-18-DataMarket</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It seems that every day brings a better system for exploring and sharing data on the Internet. From Iceland comes  DataMarket . DataMarket is very good at visualizing individual datasets – with interaction and animation, although the “market” aspect hasn’t yet been developed, and all access is free.
 
Here’s an example of visualizing rankings of countries competing in WorldCup:
 
   
 
And here’s a lovely example of visualizing  population pyramids :
 
  
  
 
In the future, the visualizations will also include state of the art models for predicting and imputing missing data, and understanding the underlying mechanisms.

<p>Introduction: I was asked by Sophie Roell, an editor at  The Browser ,  where every day they ask an expert in a field to recommend the top five books, not by them, in their subject.  I was asked to recommend five books on how Americans vote.
 
The trouble is that I’m really pretty unfamiliar with the academic literature of political science, but it seemed sort of inappropriate for a political scientist such as myself to recommend non-scholarly books that I like (for example, “Style vs. Substance” by George V. Higgins, “Lies My Teacher Told Me,” by James Loewen, “The Rascal King” by Jack Beatty, “Republican Party Reptile” by P. J. O’Rourke, and, of course, “All the King’s Men,” by Robert Penn Warren).  I mean, what’s the point of that?  Nobody needs me to recommend books like that.
 
Instead, I moved sideways and asked if I could discuss five books on statistics instead.  Roell said that would be fine, so I sent her a quick description, which appears below.

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>6 0.10913949 <a title="1637-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-25-Classics_of_statistics.html">109 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-25-Classics of statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Geen Tomko asks:
  
Can you recommend a good introductory book for statistical computation? Mostly, something that would help make it easier in collecting and analyzing data from student test scores.
  
I don’t know.  Usually, when people ask for a starter statistics book, my recommendation (beyond my own books) is The Statistical Sleuth.  But that’s not really a computation book.  ARM isn’t really a statistical computation book either.  But the statistical computation books that I’ve seen don’t seems so relevant for the analyses that Tomko is looking for.  For example, the R book of Venables and Ripley focuses on nonparametric statistics, which is fine but seems a bit esoteric for these purposes.

I am writing to ask you to recommend papers, books–anything that comes to mind that might give a prospective statistician some sense of what the future holds for statistics (and statisticians). I have a liberal arts background with an emphasis in mathematics. It seems like this is an exciting time to be a statistician, but that’s just from the outside looking in. I’m curious about your perspective on the future of the discipline.
  
Any recommendations?  My favorite is still the book, “Statistics:  A Guide to the Unknown,” first edition.

<p>Introduction: A student I’m working with writes:
  
I was planning on getting a applied stat text as a desk reference, and for that I’m assuming you’d recommend your own book. Also, being an economics student, I was initially planning on doing my analysis in STATA, but I noticed on your blog that you use R, and apparently so does the rest of the statistics profession. Would you rather I do my programming in R this summer, or does it not matter? It doesn’t look too hard to learn, so just let me know what’s most convenient for you.
  
My reply:  Yes, I recommend my book with Jennifer Hill.  Also the book by John Fox, An R and S-plus Companion to Applied Regression, is a good way to get into R.  I recommend you use both Stata and R.  If you’re already familiar with Stata, then stick with it–it’s a great system for working with big datasets.  You can grab your data in Stata, do some basic manipulations, then save a smaller dataset to read into R (using R’s read.dta() function).

<p>Introduction: Dave Choi writes:
  
I’m building a course called “Exploring and visualizing data,” for Heinz college in Carnegie Mellon (public policy and information systems). Do you know any books that might be good for such a course? I’m hoping to get non-statisticians to appreciate the statistician’s point of view on this subject.
  
I immediately thought of Bill Cleveland’s 1985 classic, The Elements of Graphing Data, but I wasn’t sure of what comes next.  There are a lot of books on how to make graphics in R, but I’m not quite sure that’s the point.  And I’m loath to recommend Tufte since it would be kinda scary if a student were to take all of his ideas too seriously.
 
Any suggestions?</p><p>2 0.91971219 <a title="1637-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-04-Columbo_does_posterior_predictive_checks.html">1521 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-04-Columbo does posterior predictive checks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m already on record as saying that  Ronald Reagan was a statistician  so I think this is ok too . . .
 
   
 
Here’s what Columbo does.  He hears the killer’s story and he takes it very seriously (it’s murder, and Columbo never jokes about murder), examines all its implications, and finds where it doesn’t fit the data.  Then Columbo carefully examines the discrepancies, tries some model expansion, and eventually concludes that he’s proved there’s a problem.
 
OK, now you’re saying:  Yeah, yeah, sure, but how does that differ from any other fictional detective?  The difference, I think, is that the tradition is for the detective to find clues and use these to come up with hypotheses, or to trap the killer via internal contradictions in his or her statement.  I see Columbo is different—and more in keeping with chapter 6 of Bayesian Data Analysis—in that he is taking the killer’s story seriously and exploring all its implications.  That’s the essence of predictive model checking:  you t</p><p>3 0.91012323 <a title="1637-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-Census_dotmap.html">1653 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-Census dotmap</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andrew Vande Moere points to  this  impressive interactive map from Brandon Martin-Anderson showing the locations of all the residents of the United States and Canada.
 
It says, “The map has 341,817,095 dots – one for each person.”  Not quite . . . I was hoping to zoom into my building (approximately 10 people live on our floor, I say approximately because two of the apartments are split between two floors and I’m not sure how they would assign the residents), but unfortunately our entire block is just a solid mass of black.  Also, they put a few dots in the park and in the river by accident (presumably because the borders of the census blocks were specified only approximately).  But, hey, no algorithm is perfect.
 
 
 
It’s hard to know what to do about this.  The idea of mapping every person is cool, but you’ll always run into trouble displaying densely populated areas.  Smaller dots might work, but then that might depend on the screen being used for display.</p><p>4 0.89422184 <a title="1637-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-30-Question_%26_Answer_Communities.html">118 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-30-Question & Answer Communities</a></p>
<p>Introduction: StackOverflow  has been a  popular community where software developers would help one another. Recently they  raised some VC funding , and to make profits they are selling job postings and expanding the model to other areas.  Metaoptimize LLC  has started a similar website, using the open-source  OSQA framework  for such as statistics and machine learning. Here’s a description:
  

You and other data geeks can ask and answer questions on machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, text analysis, information retrieval, search, data mining, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
   

Here you can ask and answer questions, comment and vote for the questions of others and their answers. Both questions and answers can be revised and improved. Questions can be tagged with the relevant keywords to simplify future access and organize the accumulated material.

  
If you work very hard on your questions and answers, you will receive badges like “Guru”, “Studen</p><p>5 0.87388164 <a title="1637-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-29-Auto-Gladwell%2C_or_Can_fractals_be_used_to_predict_human_history%3F.html">11 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-29-Auto-Gladwell, or Can fractals be used to predict human history?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just reviewed the book Bursts, by Albert-László Barabási, for Physics Today.  But I had a lot more to say that couldn’t fit into the magazine’s 800-word limit.  Here I’ll reproduce what I sent to Physics Today, followed by my additional thoughts.
  
The back cover of Bursts book promises “a revolutionary new theory showing how we can predict human behavior.”  I wasn’t fully convinced on that score, but the book does offer a well-written and thought-provoking window into author Albert-László Barabási’s research in power laws and network theory.


Power laws–the mathematical pattern that little things are common and large things are rare–have been observed in many different domains, including incomes (as noted by economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth century), word frequencies (as noted by linguist George Zipf), city sizes, earthquakes, and virtually anything else that can be measured.

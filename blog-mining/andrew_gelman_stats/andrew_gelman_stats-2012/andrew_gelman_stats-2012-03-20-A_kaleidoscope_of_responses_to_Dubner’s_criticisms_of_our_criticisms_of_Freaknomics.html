In response, I thought it would be interesting to go “meta” here by considering all the different ways ways that I  could  reply to Dubner’s criticism of our criticism of his writings.  (In the same post, Dubner also slams Chris Blattman (or, as he calls him, “a man named Chris Blattman”), but I won’t get into that here.)
 
In reacting to Dubner, I will give several perspectives,  all of which I believe .  Usually in writing a response, one would have to choose, but here I find it interesting to present all these different perspectives in one place.
 
 1.  Understand. 
 
I understand where Dubner is coming from.    We say some positive things and some negative things about his work, but it’s natural for him to focus on the negative.

</p><p>6 There’s some good stuff there but seemingly no filter. [sent-45, score-0.064]
</p><p>7 There are deeper problems, some clue of which might be found by reading all these critiques with an eye to learning rather than mere rebuttal. [sent-48, score-0.065]
</p><p>8 Don’t get distracted by your fans on the blog—consider that room full of science writers! [sent-49, score-0.13]

</p><p>10 In another confusion of motivation, Dubner describes it as “weaselly” when Kaiser and I wrote, “Although there’s no way we can be sure, perhaps, in some of the cases described above, there was a breakdown in the division of labor when it came to investigating technical points. [sent-60, score-0.235]

</p><p>14 To get back to the specific point, we suspect there were breakdowns in the division of labor, but we can’t be sure, so that’s what we wrote. [sent-67, score-0.117]
</p><p>15 I’ve never met Steven Levitt but I’m pretty sure that he has the technical ability to, say, evaluate a statistically-flawed claim about beauty and sex ratios. [sent-68, score-0.238]
</p><p>16 That’s an example of a breakdown in the division of labor. [sent-70, score-0.146]

<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>4 0.36687413 <a title="1223-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-25-Freakonomics_Experiments.html">1692 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-25-Freakonomics Experiments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stephen Dubner  writes :
  
Freakonomics Experiments is a set of simple experiments about complex issues—whether to break up with your significant other, quit your job, or start a diet, just to name a few. . . . a collaboration between researchers at the University of Chicago, Freakonomics, and—we hope!—you. Steve Levitt and John List, of the University of Chicago, run the experimental and statistical side of things. Stephen Dubner, Steve Levitt, and the Freakonomics staff have given these experiments the Freakonomics twist you’re used to. Once you flip the coin, you become a member of the most important part of the collaboration, the Freakonomics Experiments team. Without your participation, we couldn’t complete any of this research. . . .


You’ll choose a question that you are facing today, such as whether to quit your job or buy a house. Then you’ll provide us some background information about yourself. After that, you’ll flip the coin to find out what you should do in your situati</p><p>5 0.35709745 <a title="1223-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-Flip_it_around.html">943 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-Flip it around</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  discusses  a radio interview on the effect of parents on children’s education.  In short, the interviewer (Stephen Dubner of Freakonomics fame) claims that the research shows that parents don’t have much influence on whether their children go to college.  The evidence is based on a comparison of adopted and non-adopted children.  Palko makes a convincing case that the statistical analysis (by economist Bruce Sacerdote) doesn’t show what Dubner says it shows.
 
I looked over the linked transcript, and overall I’m less unhappy than Palko is about the interview.  I agree that some of the causal implications are sloppy, and I think it’s a bit silly for the interviewer (Kai Ryssdal) to use celebrities as a benchmark.  (Ryssdal says, “if [a certain parenting style is] good enough for Steven Levitt, it’s good enough for me.”  But Levitt is a multimillionaire—he’ll always have a huge financial cushion.  It’s not clear that what works for him would work for others who are not so wel</p><p>6 0.33903456 <a title="1223-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>

2.  I think it was at best tacky and</p><p>4 0.88462752 <a title="1223-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>5 0.85322994 <a title="1223-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-25-Freakonomics_Experiments.html">1692 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-25-Freakonomics Experiments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stephen Dubner  writes :
  
Freakonomics Experiments is a set of simple experiments about complex issues—whether to break up with your significant other, quit your job, or start a diet, just to name a few. . . . a collaboration between researchers at the University of Chicago, Freakonomics, and—we hope!—you. Steve Levitt and John List, of the University of Chicago, run the experimental and statistical side of things. Stephen Dubner, Steve Levitt, and the Freakonomics staff have given these experiments the Freakonomics twist you’re used to. Once you flip the coin, you become a member of the most important part of the collaboration, the Freakonomics Experiments team. Without your participation, we couldn’t complete any of this research. . . .

<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>2 0.96638703 <a title="1223-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96357119 <a title="1223-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-20-A_kaleidoscope_of_responses_to_Dubner%E2%80%99s_criticisms_of_our_criticisms_of_Freaknomics.html">1223 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-20-A kaleidoscope of responses to Dubner’s criticisms of our criticisms of Freaknomics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  pointed  me to a new  blog post  by Stephen Dubner in which he expresses disagreement with what Kaiser and I wrote in our American Scientist  article , “Freakonomics:  What Went Wrong?”.
 
In response, I thought it would be interesting to go “meta” here by considering all the different ways ways that I  could  reply to Dubner’s criticism of our criticism of his writings.  (In the same post, Dubner also slams Chris Blattman (or, as he calls him, “a man named Chris Blattman”), but I won’t get into that here.)
 
In reacting to Dubner, I will give several perspectives,  all of which I believe .  Usually in writing a response, one would have to choose, but here I find it interesting to present all these different perspectives in one place.
 
 1.  Understand. 
 
I understand where Dubner is coming from.    We say some positive things and some negative things about his work, but it’s natural for him to focus on the negative.  I’m the same way myself, probably almost all autho</p><p>4 0.95370978 <a title="1223-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Science%2C_ideology%2C_and_human_origins.html">483 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Science, ideology, and human origins</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  link  from Tyler Cowen led me to this  long blog article  by Razib Khan, discussing some recent genetic findings on human origins in the context of the past twenty-five years of research and popularization of science.
  

 
I don’t know much about human origins (beyond my ooh-that’s-cool reactions to exhibits at the Natural History Museum, my general statistician’s skepticism at various over-the-top claims I’ve heard over the years about “mitochondrial Eve” and the like, and various bits I’ve read over the years regarding when people came over to Australia, America, etc.), but what particularly interested me about Khan’s article was his discussion about the various controversies among scientists, his own reactions when reading and thinking about these issues as they were happening (Khan was a student at the time), and the interaction between science and political ideology.
 
There’s a limit to how far you can go with this sort of cultural criticism of science, and Khan realizes this</p><p>5 0.95203161 <a title="1223-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>6 0.95167261 <a title="1223-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-15-1-2_social_scientist_%2B_1-2_politician_%3D_%3F%3F%3F.html">713 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-15-1-2 social scientist + 1-2 politician = ???</a></p>

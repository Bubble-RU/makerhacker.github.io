<p>Introduction: I’ve whined before in this space that some of my most important, innovative, and influential papers are really hard to get published.  I’ll go through endless hassle with a journal or sometimes several journals until I find some place willing to publish.  It’s just irritating.
 
I was thinking about this recently because a colleague and I just finished a paper that I love love love.  But I can’t figure out where to submit it.  This is a paper for which I would prefer the so-called reverse-journal-submission approach.  Instead of sending the paper to journal after journal after journal, waiting years until an acceptance (recall that, unless you’re Bruno Frey, you’re not allowed to submit the same paper to multiple journals simultaneously), you post the paper on a public site, and then journals compete to see who gets to publish it.  I think that system would work well with a paper like this which is offbeat but has a nontrivial chance of becoming highly influential.

In my book “Uneducated Guesses” in the chapter on value-added models, I discuss how the treatment of missing data can have a profound effect on the estimates of teacher scores. I made up how a principal might send the best students on a field trip at the beginning of the year when the ‘pre-test’ was given (and their scores would be imputed from the students who showed up) and that the bottom half of the class would have a matching field trip on the day of the post test. Everyone laughed.


But apparently someone decided to take it seriously.

<p>Introduction: From 1982:
  
The necessary conceit of the essayist must be that in writing down what is obvious to him he is not wasting his reader’s time.  The value of what he does will depend on the quality of his perception, not on the length of his manuscript.  Too many dull books about literature would have been tolerably long essays; too many dull long essays would have been reasonably interesting short ones; too many short essays should have been letters to the editor.  If the essayist has a literary personality his essay will add up to something all of a piece.  If he has not, he may write fancily titled books until doomsday and do no good.  Most of the criticism that matters at all has been written in essay form.  This fact is no great mystery:  what there is to say about literature is very important, but there just isn’t all that much of it.  Literature says most things itself, when it is allowed to.

Journals Need to Pick One”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  writes :
  
As long as a journal pursues a strategy of publishing “wow” studies, it will inevitably contain more unreplicable findings and unsupportable conclusions than equally rigorous but more “boring” journals. Groundbreaking will always be higher-risk. And definitive will be the territory of journals that publish meta-analyses and reviews. . . .


Most conclusions, even those in peer-reviewed papers in rigorous journals, should be regarded as tentative at best; but press releases and other public communication rarely convey that. . . .
  
His message to all of us:
  
Our standard response to a paper in Science, Nature, or Psychological Science should be “wow, that’ll be really interesting if it replicates.” And in our teaching and our engagement with the press and public, we need to make clear why that is the most enthusiastic response we can justify.</p><p>3 0.72691441 <a title="1118-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-15-A_statistical_research_project%3A__Weeding_out_the_fraudulent_citations.html">1321 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-15-A statistical research project:  Weeding out the fraudulent citations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  blog post  by Phil Davis on “the emergence of a citation cartel.”  Davis tells the story: 
  
  
Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived. Of the remaining 45 citations, 44 cited the Me</p><p>4 0.72538018 <a title="1118-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>5 0.71715552 <a title="1118-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-28-Wiley_Wegman_chutzpah_update%3A__Now_you_too_can_buy_a_selection_of_garbled_Wikipedia_articles%2C_for_a_mere_%241400-%242800_per_year%21.html">930 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-28-Wiley Wegman chutzpah update:  Now you too can buy a selection of garbled Wikipedia articles, for a mere $1400-$2800 per year!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer sends in this rejection letter from Sir David Brewster of The Edinburgh Journal of Science to Charles Babbage:
  
It is no inconsiderable degree of reluctance that I decline the offer of any Paper from you. I think, however, you will upon reconsideration of the subject be of the opinion that I have no other alternative. The subjects you propose for a series of Mathematical and Metaphysical Essays are so profound, that there is perhaps not a single subscriber to our Journal who could follow them.

<p>Introduction: These  (from Shaun Usher) are surprisingly good, especially since he appears to come up with new lists and letters pretty regularly.  I suppose a lot of them get sent in from readers, but still.
 
Here’s my favorite recent item, a  letter  sent to the Seattle Bureau of Prohibition in 1931:
  
Dear Sir:


My husband is in the habit of buying a quart of wiskey every other day from a Chinese bootlegger named Chin Waugh living at 317-16th near Alder street.


We need this money for household expenses. Will you please have his place raided? He keeps a supply planted in the garden and a smaller quantity under the back steps for quick delivery. If you make the raid at 9:30 any morning you will be sure to get the goods and Chin also as he leaves the house at 10 o’clock and may clean up before he goes.


Thanking you in advance, 


I remain 
yours truly,


Mrs. Hillyer</p><p>3 0.78613693 <a title="1118-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-Say_again%3F.html">169 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-Say again?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Ich glaube, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung das richtige Werkzeug zum Lösen solcher Probleme ist”,  sagt Andrew Gelman , Statistikprofessor von der Columbia-Universität in New York. Wie oft aber derart knifflige Aufgaben im realen Leben auftauchen, könne er nicht sagen. Was fast schon beruhigend klingt.

<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>5 0.73668098 <a title="1118-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-24-ESPN_is_looking_to_hire_a_research_analyst.html">1279 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-24-ESPN is looking to hire a research analyst</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

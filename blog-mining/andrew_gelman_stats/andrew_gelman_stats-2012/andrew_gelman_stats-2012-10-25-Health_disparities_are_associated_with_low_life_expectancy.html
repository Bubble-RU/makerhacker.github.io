<p>Introduction: Yu Xie thought I’d have something to say about  this recent paper , “Evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy from China’s Huai River policy,” by Yuyu Chen, Avraham Ebenstein, Michael Greenstone, and Hongbin Li, which begins:
  
This paper’s findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China’s Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectanci</p><p>3 0.14256862 <a title="1548-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-But_it_all_goes_to_pay_for_gas%2C_car_insurance%2C_and_tolls_on_the_turnpike.html">9 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-But it all goes to pay for gas, car insurance, and tolls on the turnpike</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a New Yorker I think I’m obliged to pass on the occasional Jersey joke (most recently,  this one , which annoyingly continues to attract spam comments).  I’ll let the above title be my comment on this  entry  from Tyler Cowen entitled, “Which Americans are ‘best off’?”:
  
If you consult human development indices the answer is Asians living in New Jersey.  The standard is:

 
The index factors in life expectancy at birth, educational degree attainment among adults 25-years or older, school enrollment for people at least three years old and median annual gross personal earnings.
 
  
More generally, these sorts of rankings and ndexes seem to be cheap ways of grabbing headlines.

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  sends  along  this  from Corinne Moss-Racusin, John Dovidio, Victoria Brescoll, Mark Graham, and Jo Handelsman:
  
Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. . . . In a randomized double-blind study . . . science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. . . .
  
I hate to talk about things like this since presumably I’m a beneficiary.  But now that I’ve climbed the ladder myself I suppose I’m not at any risk.  I don’t know anything much about lab manager positions—that’s more something you’d see in a biology department—but I do</p><p>5 0.13388453 <a title="1548-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Further_thoughts_on_happiness_and_life_satisfaction_research.html">98 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Further thoughts on happiness and life satisfaction research</a></p>

 Robert Zubrin  writes in  “How Much Is an Astronaut’s Life Worth?”  ( Reason ,  Feb 2012 ):
     
…policy analyst John D. Graham and his colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found in 1997 that the median cost for lifesaving expenditures and regulations by the U.S. government in the health care, residential, transportation, and occupational areas ranges from about $1 million to $3 million spent per life saved in today’s dollars. The only marked exception to this pattern occurs in the area of environmental health protection (such as the Superfund program) which costs about $200 million per life saved.


Graham and his colleagues call the latter kind of inefficiency “ statistical murder ,” since thousands of additional lives could be saved each year if the money were used more cost-effectively. To avoid such deadly waste, the Department of Transportation has a policy of rejecting any proposed safety expenditure that costs more than $3</p><p>3 0.77157241 <a title="1548-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-The_most_dangerous_jobs_in_America.html">1086 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-The most dangerous jobs in America</a></p>

On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)

Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>6 0.64320606 <a title="1548-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-16-Recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">1765 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-16-Recently in the sister blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: It’s not just for Chaucer (or Mad Max) anymore.   Peter Frase writes:
  
It’s a shame that we neglect to re-translate older works into English merely because they were originally written in English. Languages change, and our reactions to words and formulations change. This is obvious when you read something like Chaucer, but it’s true to a more subtle degree of more recent writings. There is a pretty good chance that something written in the 19th century won’t mean the same thing to us that it meant to its contemporary readers. Thus it would make sense to re-translate Huckleberry Finn into modern language, in the same way we periodically get new translations of Homer or Dante or Thomas Mann. This is a point that applies equally well to non-fiction and social theory: in some ways, English-speaking sociologists are lucky that our canonical trio of classical theorists-Marx, Weber, and Durkheim-all wrote in another language. The most recent translation of Capital is eminently more readable</p><p>3 0.91767436 <a title="1548-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-03-Absolutely_last_Niall_Ferguson_post_ever%2C_in_which_I_offer_him_serious_advice.html">1040 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-03-Absolutely last Niall Ferguson post ever, in which I offer him serious advice</a></p>

Far more than in Europe, most Americans remain instinctively loyal to the killer applications of Western ascendancy, from competition all the way through to the work ethic. They know the country has the right software. They just can’t understand why it’s running so damn slowly.


What we need to do is to delete the viruses that have crept into our system: the anticompetitive quasi monopolies that blight everything from banking to public education; the politically correct pseudosciences and soft subjects that deflect good students away from hard science; the lobbyists who subvert the rule of law for the sake of the special interests they represent—to say nothing of our crazily dysfunctional system of health care, our overleveraged personal finances, and our newfound unemployment ethic.

After reading your recent  post , I thought you might find  this  interesting – especially the scanned interview that is included at the bottom of the posting. It’s an old OMNI interview with Walter Stewart that was the first thing I read (at a young and impressionable age ;) about the prevalence of errors, fraud and cheating in science, the institutional barriers to tackling it, the often high personal costs to whistleblowers, the difficulty of accessing scientific data to repeat published analyses, and the surprisingly negative attitude towards criticism within scientific communities. Highly recommended entertaining reading – with some good examples of scientific investigations into implausible effects. The post itself contains the info I once dug up about what happened to him later – he seems like an interesting and very determined guy: when the NIH tried to stop him from investigating scientific errors and fraud he went on a hunger strike.

<p>Introduction: My Columbia colleague Sheena Iyengar (most famous among ARM readers for her speed-dating experiment) writes an interesting  column  on potential reactions to a tax on sugary drinks.  The idea is that people might be so annoyed at being told what to do that they might buy more of the stuff, at least in the short term.
 
On the other hand, given the famous subsidies involved in the production of high-fructose corn syrup, soda pop is probably a bit cheaper than it should be, so maybe it all balances out?
 
I agree with Sheena that there’s something about loss of control that is particularly frustrating.  One thing that bugs me when I buy a Coke is that I’m paying for the fees of Michael Jordan or whoever it is they have nowadays endorsing their product.  I wish there were some way I could just pay for everything else but withhold the money that’s going into those silly celebrity endorsements.</p><p>6 0.91346854 <a title="1548-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-21-Could_I_use_a_statistics_coach%3F.html">968 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-21-Could I use a statistics coach?</a></p>

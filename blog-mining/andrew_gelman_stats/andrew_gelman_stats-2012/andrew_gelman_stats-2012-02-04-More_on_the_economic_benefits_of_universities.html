<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .
  
OK, fine, so individual creatives aren’t doing so well?  But what about the larger urban economies?

<p>Introduction: Ed Glaeser  writes :
  
The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York is often credited with saying that the way to create a great city is to “create a great university and wait 200 years,” and the body of evidence on the role that universities play in generating urban growth continues to grow.
  
I’ve always thought this too, that it’s too bad that, given the total cost, a lot more cities would’ve benefited, over the years, by maintaining great universities rather than building expensive freeways, RenCens, and so forth.
 
But Joseph Delaney  argues the opposite , considering the case of New Haven, home of what is arguably the second-best university in the country (I assume Glaeser would agree with me on this one):
  
 
According to wikipedia, the poverty rate in New Haven is 24%, which compares unfavorably with the rest of the United States where it is 14%. The poverty rate in New Haven, despite the presence of Yale, is nearly twice that of the United States as a whole.

<p>Introduction: In an article provocatively entitled, “Will Ohio State’s football team decide who wins the White House?”, Tyler Cowen and Kevin Grier  report :
  
It is statistically possible that the outcome of a handful of college football games in the right battleground states could determine the race for the White House.


Economists Andrew Healy, Neil Malhotra, and Cecilia Mo make this argument in a fascinating article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. They examined whether the outcomes of college football games on the eve of elections for presidents, senators, and governors affected the choices voters made. They found that a win by the local team, in the week before an election, raises the vote going to the incumbent by around 1.5 percentage points. When it comes to the 20 highest attendance teams—big athletic programs like the University of Michigan, Oklahoma, and Southern Cal—a victory on the eve of an election pushes the vote for the incumbent up by 3 percentage points.

<p>Introduction: After  posting  on David Rubinstein’s remarks on his “cushy life” as a sociology professor at a public university, I read  these remarks  by some of Rubinstein’s colleagues at the University of Illinois, along with a response from Rubinstein.
 
Before getting to the policy issues, let me first say that I think it must have been so satisfying, first for Rubinstein and then for his colleagues (Barbara Risman, William Bridges, and Anthony Orum) to publish these notes.  We all have people we know and hate, but we rarely have a good excuse for blaring our feelings in public. (I remember when I was up for tenure, I was able to read the outside letters on my case (it’s a public university and they have rules), and one of the letter writers really hated my guts.  I was surprised–I didn’t know the guy well (the letters were anonymized but it was clear from context who the letter writer was) but the few times we’d met, he’d been cordial enough–but there you have it.

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>3 0.75908798 <a title="1153-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-01-%24241%2C364.83_%E2%80%93_%2413%2C000_%3D_%24228%2C364.83.html">1600 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-01-$241,364.83 – $13,000 = $228,364.83</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A blog commenter pointed me to  this  news article on Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociology professor here:
  
He was the subject last year of a grueling investigation into a quarter-million dollars of spending that Columbia auditors said was insufficiently documented, misappropriated or outright fabricated.


According to internal documents from that investigation, which were obtained by The New York Times, the auditors said that Professor Venkatesh directed $52,328 to someone without any “documented evidence of work performed.” He listed a dinner for 25 people, relating to research on professional baseball players; auditors found that only 8 people had attended . . .


All told, auditors questioned expenses amounting to $241,364.83. . . .


Professor Venkatesh said in a brief phone conversation in October that he had repaid $13,000. . . . “I have never been accused of fraud or embezzlement.”
  
One thing that frustrates me with newspaper articles is when they don’t follow up.

<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.

They discuss how there is tons of federal support for basic research but that there’s a big gap between research findings and medical applications–a gap that, according to them, arises not just from the inevitable problem that not all research hypotheses pan out, but because actual promising potential cures don’t get researched because of the cost.
 
I have two thoughts on this.  First, in my experience, research at any level requires a continuing forward momentum, a push from  somebody  to keep it going.  I’ve worked on some great projects (some of which had Federal research funding) that ground to a halt because the original motivation died.  I expect this is true with medical research also.  One of the projects that I’m thinking of, which I’ve made almost no progress on for several years, I’m sure would make a useful contribution.  I pretty much know it would work–it just takes work to make it work, and it’s hard to do this</p><p>6 0.74555624 <a title="1153-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-%E2%80%A6pretty_soon_you%E2%80%99re_talking_real_money..html">68 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-…pretty soon you’re talking real money.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Last year my commenters and I  discussed  Ed Glaeser’s claim that the way to create a great city is to “create a great university and wait 200 years.”
 
I passed this on to urbanist Richard Florida and received the following response: 
  
  
This is a tough one with lots of causality issues.  Generally speaking universities make places stronger. But this is mainly the case for smaller, college towws. Boulder, Ann Arbor and so on, which also have very high human capital levels and high levels of creative, knowledge and professional workers. 


For big cities the issue is mixed. Take Pittsburgh with CMU and Pitt or Baltimore with Hopkins, or St Louis. The list goes on and on.


Kevin Stolarick and I framed this very crudely as a transmitter reciever issue. The university in a city like this can generate a lot of signal, in terms of innovation or even human capital and the city may not receive it or push it away. A long ago paper by Mike Fogarty showed how innovations in Pittsburgh and Cl</p><p>2 0.91584063 <a title="1153-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-17-Horrible_but_harmless%3F.html">1581 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-17-Horrible but harmless?</a></p>

In re your recent  post : Can you make sense of  this ?
  
My reply: This is not the kind of thing that I like at all. But for some reason it doesn’t bother me enough for me to want to mock it. Perhaps because I sense that the people who write this sort of thing have very little power or influence.
 
Then again, a check of Wikipedia reveals that the author of the above article is “currently Professor and Bill Daniels Ethics Fellow, a past endowed Bank of America professor of management at New Mexico State University.” The connection between “Ethics Fellow” and “Bank of America professor of management,” that’s a bit creepy.</p><p>3 0.91307688 <a title="1153-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-23-Infographic_of_the_year.html">1277 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-23-Infographic of the year</a></p>

What really makes it work, I think, is that it goes slowly enough.  2 minutes and 45 seconds is enough time for me, as a viewer, to feel like Iâ&euro;&trade;m living through each stage of development.  If the video were sped up to go from 0 to 12 in only 30 seconds, that would be cool in its own way but would give up the sense of local stability that is characteristic of development.</p><p>4 0.91236198 <a title="1153-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Computer_models_of_the_oil_spill.html">243 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Computer models of the oil spill</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In reaction to  this  news article by Michael Kimmelman, I’d like to repost  this  from four years ago:
  
Walking through Penn Station in New York, I remembered how much I love its open structure. By “open,” I don’t mean bright and airy. I mean “open” in a topological sense. The station has three below-ground levels–the uppermost has ticket counters (and, what is more relevant nowadays, ticket machines), some crappy stores and restaurants, and a crappy waiting area. The middle level has Long Island Rail Road ticket counters, some more crappy stores and restaurants, and entrances to the 7th and 8th Avenue subway lines. The lower level has train tracks and platforms. There are stairs, escalators, and elevators going everywhere. As a result, it’s easy to get around, there are lots of shortcuts, and the train loads fast–some people come down the escalators and elevators from the top level, others take the stairs from the middle level.

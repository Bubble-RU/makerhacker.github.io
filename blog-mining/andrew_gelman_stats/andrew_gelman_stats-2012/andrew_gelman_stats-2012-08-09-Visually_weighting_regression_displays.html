Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.

The matlab and stata functions I wrote, as well as the script that replicates my figures, are all posted on  my website .


Also, I just added options to the main matlab function (vwregress.m) to make it display the spaghetti plot (similar to what Lucas did, but a simple bootstrap) and the shaded CI that you suggested (see figs below). They’re good suggestions.


   


   


Personally, I [Hsiang] like the shaded CI better, since I think that all the visual activity in the spaghetti plot is a little distracting and sometimes adds visual weight in places where I wouldn’t want it.  But the option is there in case people like it.

In my profession as a risk manager I encountered this graph:


   


I can’t figure out what kind of regression this is, would you be so kind to enlighten me? 
The points represent (maturity,yield) of bonds.
  
My reply:  That’s a fun problem, reverse-engineering a curve fit!  My first guess is lowess, although it seems too flat and asympoty on the right side of the graph to be lowess.  Maybe a Gaussian process?  Looks too smooth to be a spline.  I guess I’ll go with my original guess, on the theory that lowess is the most accessible smoother out there, and if someone fit something much more complicated they’d make more of a big deal about it.  On the other hand, if the curve is an automatic output of some software (Excel? Stata?) then it could be just about anything.
 
Does anyone have any ideas?</p><p>6 0.71146548 <a title="1452-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Lowess_is_great.html">293 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Lowess is great</a></p>

One of my colleagues suggested that I send you  this very short note  that I wrote on a new approach for displaying regression result uncertainty (attached). It’s very simple, and I’ve found it effective in one of my papers where I actually use it, but if you have a chance to glance over it and have any ideas for how to sell the approach or make it better, I’d be very interested to hear them. (Also, if you’ve seen that someone else has already made this point, I’d appreciate knowing that too.)
  
Here’s an example:

<p>Introduction: Jemes Keirstead sends along  this infographic :
 
 
 
He hates it:
  
First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.e. the pinch point in the glass) is actually 3-5 years in the future and the past sand includes “up to three years” in the future.  Then there are the percentages which are appear to represent a vertical distance, not volume of sand or width of the hourglass.  Add to that a strange color scheme in which green goes from dark to light to dark again.


I know January’s not even finished yet, but surely a competitor for worst infographic of 2013?
  
Keirstead doesn’t even comment on what I see as the worst aspect of the graph, which is that the “3-5 years” band is the narrowest on the graph, but expressed as a per-year rate it is actually the  highest  of all the percentages.  The hourglass visualization does the astounding feat of taking the period where the executives expect the highest rate of change and presenting it as a minimum in the graph.</p><p>3 0.9687987 <a title="1452-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-02-The_new_Helen_DeWitt_novel.html">886 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-02-The new Helen DeWitt novel</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read the excerpt in n+1.  As one would expect of DeWitt, it was great, while being nothing at all like her  other  book.  THe new book reminded me a bit of Philip K. Dick.  Here’s a brief excerpt (which is not actually particularly PKD-like) of the main character talking to himself:
  
“I don’t have what it takes,” he said.  He had never said it before because saying it would be like admitting he couldn’t make the grade.
  
I’m not pulling out this quote to sell you on the book.  The lines just struck me because of the exquisite distinctions, the idea that “don’t have what it takes” is somehow different than “couldn’t make the grade,” the idea that this character, who expresses his thoughts in empty phrases, ends up assigning to these phrases a set of precise meanings that make sense only to him.

And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized.

<p>Introduction: Back when I taught at Berkeley, I once asked a Ph.D. student how he’d decided to work with me.  He said that a couple of the tenured professors had advised him not to take my class, and that this advice had got him curious:  What about  Bayesian statistics is so dangerous that it can scare these otherwise unflappable stat professors.  Overall, my senior colleagues’ advice to students to avoid my course probably decreased my enrollment, but the students who  did  decide to attend surely had better character than the ones who followed directions.  (Or, at least I’d like to think that.)
 
I was reminded of that incident recently when reading a  news article  by Marc Tracy:
  
A U.S. Department of Education committee is investigating whether a Columbia University department head “steered” a Jewish student away from taking a class on the Mideast taught by Professor Joseph Massad due to the perception that she would be “uncomfortable” because of the professor’s pro-Palestinian tilt . . . “Ba</p><p>6 0.96268803 <a title="1452-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-My_course_this_fall_on_Bayesian_Computation.html">884 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-My course this fall on Bayesian Computation</a></p>

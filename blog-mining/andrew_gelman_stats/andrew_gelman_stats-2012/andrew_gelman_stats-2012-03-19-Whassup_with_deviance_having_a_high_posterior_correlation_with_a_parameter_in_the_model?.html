<p>Introduction: Yesterday we had a spirited  discussion  of the following conditional probability puzzle:
  
“I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”
  
This reminded me of the principle, familiar from  statistics instruction  and the  cognitive psychology  literature, that the best way to teach these sorts of examples is through integers rather than fractions.
 
For example, consider this classic problem:
  
“10% of persons have disease X.  You are tested for the disease and test positive, and the test has 80% accuracy.  What is the probability that you have the disease?”
  
This can be solved directly using conditional probability but it appears to be clearer to do it using integers:
  
Start with 100 people.  10 will have the disease and 90 will not.  Of the 10 with the disease, 8 will test positive and 2 will test negative.  Of the 90 without the disease, 18 will test positive and 72% will test negative.  (72% = 0.8*90.)  So, out of the origin</p><p>4 0.20111185 <a title="1221-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-30-Computational_problems_with_glm_etc..html">1516 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-30-Computational problems with glm etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mount  provides some useful background and follow-up  on our discussion  from last year  on computational instability of the usual logistic regression solver.
 
Just to refresh your memory, here’s a simple logistic regression with only a constant term and no separation, nothing pathological at all:
 
 > y <- rep (c(1,0),c(10,5)) 
> display (glm (y ~ 1, family=binomial(link="logit")))

--- 
  n = 15, k = 1 
  residual deviance = 19.1, null deviance = 19.1 (difference = 0.0) 
 
And here’s what happens when we give it the not-outrageous starting value of -2:
 
 > display (glm (y ~ 1, family=binomial(link="logit"), start=-2)) 
glm(formula = y ~ 1, family = binomial(link = "logit"), start = -2)

<p>Introduction: Somebody asks: 
  
  
Iâ&euro;&trade;m reading your paper on path sampling. It essentially solves the 
problem of computing the ratio \int q0(omega)d omega/\int q1(omega) d omega. I.e the arguments in q0() and q1() are the same. But this assumption is not always true in Bayesian model selection using Bayes factor.


In general (for BF), we have this problem, t1 and t2 may have no relation at all.


\int f1(y|t1)p1(t1) d t1 / \int f2(y|t2)p2(t2) d t2


As an example, suppose that we want to compare two sets of normally distributed data with known variance whether they have the same mean (H0) or they are not necessarily have the same mean (H1). Then the dummy variable should be mu in H0 (which is the common mean of both set of samples), and should be (mu1, mu2) (which are the means for each set of samples).


One straight method to address my problem is to preform path integration for the numerate and the denominator, as both the numerate and the denominator are integrals. Each integral can be rewrit</p><p>4 0.73655188 <a title="1221-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Unhappy_with_improvement_by_a_factor_of_10%5E29.html">160 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Unhappy with improvement by a factor of 10^29</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have an optimization problem:  I have a complicated physical model that predicts energy and thermal behavior of a building, given the values of a slew of parameters, such as insulation effectiveness, window transmissivity, etc.  I’m trying to find the parameter set that best fits several weeks of thermal and energy use data from the real building that we modeled. (Of course I would rather explore parameter space and come up with probability distributions for the parameters, and maybe that will come later, but for now I’m just optimizing).  To do the optimization, colleagues and I implemented a “particle swarm optimization” algorithm on a massively parallel machine. This involves giving each of about 120 “particles” an initial position in parameter space, then letting them move around, trying to move to better positions according to a specific algorithm.  We gave each particle an initial position sampled from our prior distribution for each parameter.

I [Metselaar] am currently involved in a discussion about the use of the notion “predictive” as used in “posterior predictive check”. I would argue that the notion “predictive” should be reserved for posterior checks using information not used in the determination of the posterior. 
I quote from the discussion: 
“However, the predictive uncertainty in a Bayesian calculation requires sampling from all the random variables, and this includes both the model parameters and the residual error”.


My [Metselaar's] comment:


This may be exactly the point I am worried about: shouldn’t the predictive uncertainty be defined as sampling from the posterior parameter distribution +  residual error + sampling from the prediction error distribution? 
Residual error reduces to measurement error in the case of a  model which is perfect for the sample of experiments. Measurement error could be reduced to almost zero by ideal and perfect measurement instruments.

Do you know what might lead to a large negative cross-correlation (-0.95) between deviance and one of the model parameters?


Here’s the (brief) background:


I [Richardson] have written a Bayesian hierarchical site occupancy model for presence of disease on individual amphibians. The response variable is therefore binary (disease present/absent) and the probability of disease being present in an individual (psi) depends on various covariates (species of amphibian, location sampled, etc.) paramaterized using a logit link function.  Replicates are individuals sampled (tested for presence of disease) together.  The possibility of imperfect detection is included as p = (prob. disease detected given disease is present).


Posterior distributions were estimated using WinBUGS via R2WinBUGS. 
Simulated data from the model fit the real data very well and posterior distribution densities seem robust to any changes in the model (different priors, etc.)  All autocor</p><p>2 0.93564689 <a title="1221-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-22-The_kluges_of_today_are_the_textbook_solutions_of_tomorrow..html">2143 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-22-The kluges of today are the textbook solutions of tomorrow.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From a response on the Stan help list:
  
Yes, indeed, I think it would be a good idea to reduce the scale on priors of the form U(0,100) or N(0,100^2).  This won’t solve all problems but it can’t hurt.


If the issue is that the variance parameter can be very small in the estimation, yes, one approach would be to put in a prior that keeps the variance away from 0 (lognormal, gamma, whatever), another approach would be to use the Matt trick.  Some mixture of these ideas might help.


And, by the way:  when you do these things it might feel like an awkward bit of kluging to play around with the model to get it to convert properly.  But the kluges of today are the textbook solutions of tomorrow.  When it comes to statistical modeling, we’re living in beta-test world; we should appreciate the opportunities this gives us!</p><p>3 0.9299016 <a title="1221-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-21-Judea_Pearl_on_why_he_is_%E2%80%9Conly_a_half-Bayesian%E2%80%9D.html">1133 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-21-Judea Pearl on why he is “only a half-Bayesian”</a></p>

I [Pearl] turned Bayesian in 1971, as soon as I began reading Savage’s monograph The Foundations of Statistical Inference [Savage, 1962]. The arguments were unassailable: (i) It is plain silly to ignore what we know, (ii) It is natural and useful to cast what we know in the language of probabilities, and (iii) If our subjective probabilities are erroneous, their impact will get washed out in due time, as the number of observations increases.


Thirty years later, I [Pearl] am still a devout Bayesian in the sense of (i), but I now doubt the wisdom of (ii) and I know that, in general, (iii) is false.

I’m fitting a state-space model right now that estimates the “design effect” of individual pollsters (Ratio of poll variance to that predicted by perfect random sampling). What would be a good prior distribution for that?
  
My quickest suggestion is start with something simple, such as a uniform from 1 to 10, and then to move to something hierarchical, such as a lognormal on (design.effect – 1), with the hyperparameters estimated from data.
 
My longer suggestion is to take things apart.  What exactly do you mean by “design effect”?  There are lots of things going on, both in sampling error (the classical “design effect” that comes from cluster sampling, stratification, weighting, etc.) and nonsampling error (nonresponse bias, likeliy voter screening, bad questions, etc.)  It would be best if you could model both pieces.</p><p>5 0.92594093 <a title="1221-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-04-Too_many_MC%E2%80%99s_not_enough_MIC%E2%80%99s%2C_or_What_principles_should_govern_attempts_to_summarize_bivariate_associations_in_large_multivariate_datasets%3F.html">1706 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-04-Too many MC’s not enough MIC’s, or What principles should govern attempts to summarize bivariate associations in large multivariate datasets?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Justin Kinney writes:
  
Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

Data Scientist 
Position Overview


Data Scientists are responsible for providing the fundamental data science that powers our work – including predictive analytics, data mining, experimental design and ad-hoc statistical analysis.  As a Data Scientist, you will join our Chicago-based data science team, working closely and collaboratively with analysts and engineers to identify, quantify and solve big, meaningful problems. Data Scientists will have the opportunity to dive deeply into big problems and work in a variety of areas.  Civis Analytics has opportunities for applicants who are seasoned professionals, brilliant new comers, and anywhere in between.

<p>Introduction: David Blei writes:
  
I have  two postdoc openings for basic research in probabilistic modeling .


The thrusts are (a) scalable inference and (b) model checking.  We 
will be developing new methods and implementing them in probabilistic 
programming systems.  I am open to applicants interested in many kinds 
of applications and from any field.
  
“Scalable inference” means black-box VB and related ideas, and “probabilistic programming systems” means Stan!  (You might be familiar with Stan as an implementation of Nuts for posterior sampling, but Stan is also an efficient program for computing probability densities and their gradients, and as such is an ideal platform for developing scalable implementations of variational inference and related algorithms.)
 
And you know I like model checking.

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts writes:
  
The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>3 0.85156476 <a title="1630-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-04-Cool_one-day_miniconference_at_Columbia_Fri_12_Oct_on_computational_and_online_social_science.html">1481 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-04-Cool one-day miniconference at Columbia Fri 12 Oct on computational and online social science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After posting that  announcement  about Civis Analytics, I wrote, “If a reconstituted Romney Analytics team is hiring, let me know and I’ll post that ad too.”  Adam Schaeffer  obliged :
  

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.

<p>Introduction: I was told about an organization called Reproducibility Initiative.  They tell me they are trying to make what was described in our “50 shades of gray”  post  standard across all of science, particularly areas like cancer research.  I don’t know anything else about them, but that sounds like a good start!

<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>4 0.94979477 <a title="1630-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-29-Postdocs_in_probabilistic_modeling%21__With_David_Blei%21__And_Stan%21.html">1961 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-29-Postdocs in probabilistic modeling!

<p>Introduction: David Blei writes:
  
I have  two postdoc openings for basic research in probabilistic modeling .


The thrusts are (a) scalable inference and (b) model checking.  We 
will be developing new methods and implementing them in probabilistic 
programming systems.  I am open to applicants interested in many kinds 
of applications and from any field.
  
“Scalable inference” means black-box VB and related ideas, and “probabilistic programming systems” means Stan!  (You might be familiar with Stan as an implementation of Nuts for posterior sampling, but Stan is also an efficient program for computing probability densities and their gradients, and as such is an ideal platform for developing scalable implementations of variational inference and related algorithms.)
 
And you know I like model checking.

<p>Introduction: Gayle Laackmann  reports  ( link  from Felix Salmon) that Microsoft, Google, etc. don’t actually ask brain-teasers in their job interviews.  The actually ask a lot of questions about programming.  (I looked  here  and was relieved to see that the questions aren’t very hard.  I could probably get a job as an entry-level programmer if I needed to.)

Let’s look at the very widely circulated “15 Google Interview Questions that will make you feel stupid” list [ here's the original list , I think, from Lewis Lin] . . . these questions are fake. Fake fake fake.  How can you tell that they’re fake?  Because one of them is “Why are manhole covers round?”  This is an infamous Microsoft interview question that has since been so very, very banned at both companies .  I find it very hard to believe that a Google interviewer asked such a question.
  
We’ll get back to the manhole question in a bit.

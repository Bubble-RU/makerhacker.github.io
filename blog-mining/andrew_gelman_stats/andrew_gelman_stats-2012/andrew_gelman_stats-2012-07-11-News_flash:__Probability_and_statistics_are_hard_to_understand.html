<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>3 0.12720524 <a title="1413-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.11795542 <a title="1413-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-27-A_use_for_tables_%28really%29.html">372 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-27-A use for tables (really)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>5 0.11101183 <a title="1413-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-14-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">2172 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-14-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>

 General advice 


Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend rewriting both articles from scratch, using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  writes :
  
I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!

<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details? 
 
Aleks pointed me to  this article  by Jeffrey Heer, Michael Bostock, and Vadim Ogievetsky, “A Tour through the Visualization Zoo:  A survey of powerful visualization techniques, from the obvious to the obscure.”  Th</p><p>4 0.79386359 <a title="1413-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-19-Standardized_writing_styles_and_standardized_graphing_styles.html">1176 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-19-Standardized writing styles and standardized graphing styles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Back in the 1700s—JennyD can correct me if I’m wrong here—there was no standard style for writing.  You could be discursive, you could be descriptive, flowery, or terse.  Direct or indirect, serious or funny.  You could construct a novel out of letters or write a philosophical treatise in the form of a novel.
 
Nowadays there are rules.  You can break the rules, but then you’re Breaking. The. Rules.  Which is a distinctive choice all its own.
 
Consider academic writing.  Serious works of economics or statistics tend to be written in a serious style in some version of plain academic English.  The few exceptions (for example, by Tukey, Tufte, Mandelbrot, and Jaynes) are clearly exceptions, written in styles that are much celebrated but not so commonly followed.

<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

<p>Introduction: In the annals of hack literature, it is sometimes said that if you aim to write best-selling crap, all you’ll end up with is crap.  To truly produce best-selling crap, you have to have a conviction, perhaps misplaced, that your writing has integrity.  Whether or not this is a good generalization about writing, I have seen an analogous phenomenon in statistics:  If you try to do nothing but model the data, you can be in for a wild and unpleasant ride:  real data always seem to have one more twist beyond our ability to model (von Neumann’s elephant’s trunk notwithstanding).  But if you model the underlying process, sometimes your model can fit surprisingly well as well as inviting openings for future research progress.</p><p>2 0.95467877 <a title="1413-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-17-Modeling_group-level_predictors_in_a_multilevel_regression.html">1216 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-17-Modeling group-level predictors in a multilevel regression</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Trey Causey writes:
  
Do you have suggestions as to model selection strategies akin to Bayesian model averaging for multilevel models when level-2 inputs are of substantive interest? I [Causey] have seen plenty of R packages and procedures for non-multilevel models, and tried the glmulti package but found that it did not perform well with more than a few level-2 variables.
  
My quick answer is:  with a name like that, you should really be fitting three-level models!
 
My longer answer is:  regular readers will be unsurprised to hear that I’m no fan of  Bayesian model averaging .  Instead I’d prefer to bite the bullet and assign an informative prior distribution on these coefficients.  I don’t have a great example of such an analysis but I’m more and more thinking that this is the way to go.  I don’t see the point in aiming for the intermediate goal of pruning the predictors; I’d rather have a procedure that includes prior information on the predictors and their interactions.</p><p>3 0.95363772 <a title="1413-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably_common_misunderstanding_of_meritocracy.html">1037 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably common misunderstanding of meritocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.  Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous”</p><p>4 0.94564462 <a title="1413-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-13-Statistical_controversy_regarding_human_rights_violations_in_Colomnbia.html">145 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-13-Statistical controversy regarding human rights violations in Colomnbia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Megan Price wrote in that she and Daniel Guzmán of the Benetech Human Rights Program released a paper today entitled  “Comments to the article ‘Is Violence Against Union Members in Colombia Systematic and Targeted?’”  (o  aqui  en español), which examines an article written by Colombian academics Daniel Mejía and María José Uribe.  Price writes [in the third person]:
  
 
The paper reviewed by Price and Guzmán concluded that “. . . on average, violence against unionists in Colombia is neither systematic nor targeted.” However, in their response, Price and Guzmán present – in technical and methodological detail – the reasons they find the conclusions in Mejía and Uribe’s study to be overstated. Price and Guzmán believe that weaknesses in the data, in the choice of the statistical model, and the interpretation of the model used in Mejía and Uribe’s study, all raise serious questions about the authors’ strong causal conclusions.


Price and Guzmán point out that unchecked, those conclusio</p><p>5 0.94323719 <a title="1413-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-28-Every_time_you_take_a_sample%2C_you%E2%80%99ll_have_to_pay_this_guy_a_quarter.html">1398 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-28-Every time you take a sample, you’ll have to pay this guy a quarter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Roy Mendelssohn pointed me to  this  heartwarming story of Jay Vadiveloo, an actuary who got a patent for the idea of statistical sampling.  Vadiveloo writes, “the results were astounding: statistical sampling worked.”
 
You may laugh, but wait till Albedo Man buys the patent and makes everybody do his bidding.  They’re gonna dig up Laplace and make him pay retroactive royalties.  And somehow Clippy will get involved in all this.
 
P.S.  Mendelssohn writes:  “Yes, I felt it was a heartwarming story also.  Perhaps we can get a patent for regression.”
 
I say, forget a patent for regression.  I want a patent for the sample mean.  That’s where the real money is.

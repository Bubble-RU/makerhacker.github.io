<p>Introduction: 19. A survey is taken of students in a metropolitan area. At the first stage a school is sampled at random. The schools are divided into two strata: 20 private schools and 50 public schools are sampled. At the second stage, 5 classes are sampled within each sampled school. At the third stage, 10 students are sampled within each class. What is the probability that any given student is sampled?

21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
  
Solution:  Nonproportional sampling is usually avoided because it makes the analysis more complicated and it results in a higher standard error for estimates of the general population.

<p>Introduction: 7. Which of the following statements accurately summarize claims made by Page and Shapiro in The Rational Public and their associated research articles? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) Americans’ attitudes on policy alternatives are highly unstable over time, reflecting a rational response to unstable political conditions.
 
(b) When studying public opinion, question-wording is less important than scholars have traditionally thought.
 
(c) Attitudes about foreign policy change more abruptly than attitudes on domestic issues.
 
(d) The contents of the mass media account for a high proportion of opinion changes on foreign policy.
 
(e) Using the assumption of rationality, Page and Shapiro fit a hedonic regression to estimate the underlying utility function of survey respondents.
 
(f) Page and Shapiro use the term “rational” ironically; their fundamental claim is that Americans are easily distracted and that rational-public models are seriously flawed.

<p>Introduction: 9. Out of a population of 100 medical records, 40 are randomly sampled and then audited. 10 out of the 40 audits reveal fraud. From this information, give an estimate, standard error, and 95% confidence interval for the proportion of audits in the population with fraud.
 
 Solution to question 8 
 
From  yesterday :
  
8. Which of the following statements accurately characterize the National Election Studies? (Indicate all that apply.)


(a) The NES began in 1960.


(b) Since 1980, the NES has mostly relied on telephone interviews.


(c) The NES typically has a sample size of about 1000â&euro;&ldquo;2000 people.


(d) The NES uses a sampling design that ensures they get respondents from all fifty states and D.C.
  
Solution:  c.  This is a purely factual question, not much to say here.</p><p>2 0.8854816 <a title="1331-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.
 
I guess what I’m saying is:</p><p>3 0.88113749 <a title="1331-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-Dispute_over_counts_of_child_deaths_in_Iraq_due_to_sanctions.html">141 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-Dispute over counts of child deaths in Iraq due to sanctions</a></p>

 Here is  yet another debunking article I’ve written, this one in the latest issue of Significance.  It shows the Lancet once again publishing spectacularly wrong information that has misinformed public discussion on a crucial issue with ongoing reverberations.  For example, there is Tony Blair’s recent justification for the Iraq war offered in front of the Chilcot Inquiry in the UK quoted at the beginning of the paper.

<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>5 0.87800688 <a title="1331-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above is the title of  a talk  that Thad Tarpey gave at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2009.  Here’s the abstract:
  
Students of statistics are often introduced to George Box’s famous quote: “all models are wrong, some are useful.” In this talk I [Tarpey] argue that this quote, although useful, is wrong. A different and more positive perspective is to acknowledge that a model is simply a means of extracting information of interest from data. The truth is infinitely complex and a model is merely an approximation to the truth. If the approximation is poor or misleading, then the model is useless. In this talk I give examples of correct models that are not true models. I illustrate how the notion of a “wrong” model can lead to wrong conclusions.

<p>Introduction: Jacob Hartog writes the following in reaction to  my post  on the use of value-added modeling for teacher assessment:
  
What I [Hartog] think has been inadequately discussed is the use of individual model specifications to assign these teacher ratings, rather than the zone of agreement across a broad swath of model specifications.


For example, the model used by NYCDOE doesn’t just control for a student’s prior year test score (as I think everyone can agree is a good idea.) It also assumes that different demographic groups will learn different amounts in a given year, and assigns a school-level random effect. The result is that, as was much ballyhooed at the time of the release of the data,the average teacher rating for a given school is roughly the same, no matter whether the school is performing great or terribly. The headline from this was “excellent teachers spread evenly across the city’s schools,” rather than “the specification of these models assume that excellent teachers are</p><p>3 0.25560477 <a title="1620-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Estimating_and_reporting_teacher_effectivenss%3A__Newspaper_researchers_do_things_that_academic_researchers_never_could.html">222 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Estimating and reporting teacher effectivenss:  Newspaper researchers do things that academic researchers never could</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.  For example, from an  official documen t, “The primary purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participati</p><p>4 0.2476929 <a title="1620-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-More_on_those_L.A._Times_estimates_of_teacher_effectiveness.html">226 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-More on those L.A. Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>6 0.18927163 <a title="1620-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Poverty%2C_educational_performance_%E2%80%93_and_can_be_done_about_it.html">561 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Poverty, educational performance – and can be done about it</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  points  to a  news article  by Michael Winerip on teacher assessment:
  
No one at the Lab Middle School for Collaborative Studies works harder than Stacey Isaacson, a seventh-grade English and social studies teacher. She is out the door of her Queens home by 6:15 a.m., takes the E train into Manhattan and is standing out front when the school doors are unlocked, at 7. Nights, she leaves her classroom at 5:30. . . .


Her principal, Megan Adams, has given her terrific reviews during the two and a half years Ms. Isaacson has been a teacher. . . . The Lab School has selective admissions, and Ms. Isaacson’s students have excelled. Her first year teaching, 65 of 66 scored proficient on the state language arts test, meaning they got 3′s or 4′s; only one scored below grade level with a 2. More than two dozen students from her first two years teaching have gone on to . . . the city’s most competitive high schools. . . .

<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>5 0.81915361 <a title="1620-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-My_proposal_for_making_college_admissions_fairer.html">93 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-My proposal for making college admissions fairer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.
 
2.  Subtract points for taking the SAT multiple times.  A simple rule would be:  You can use your highest SAT score, but you lose 50 points for every other time</p><p>6 0.81792378 <a title="1620-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-27-Grade_inflation%3A__why_weren%E2%80%99t_the_instructors_all_giving_all_A%E2%80%99s_already%3F%3F.html">825 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-27-Grade inflation:  why weren’t the instructors all giving all A’s already??</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):

<p>Introduction: I’m not a great teacher.  I can get by because I work hard and I know a lot, and for some students my classes are just great, but it’s not a natural talent of mine.  I know people who are amazing teachers, and they have something that I just don’t have.  I wrote that book, Teaching Statistics:  A Bag of Tricks (with Deb Nolan) because I’m  not  a good teacher and hence need to develop all sorts of techniques to be able to do what good teachers can do without even trying.
 
I’m not proud of being mediocre at teaching.  I don’t think that low teaching skill is some sort of indicator that I’m a great researcher.  The other think about teaching ability is that I think it’s hard to detect without actually seeing someone teach a class.  If you see me give a seminar presentation or even a guest lecture, you’d think I’m an awesome teacher.  But, actually, no.  I’m an excellent speaker, not such a great teacher.

I [Kane] am involved in a dispute relating to whether or not a blog can be considered part of one’s academic writing.  Williams College restricts the use of undergraduate theses as follows:

 
Non-commercial, academic use within the scope of “Fair Use” standards is acceptable. Otherwise, you may not copy or distribute any content without the permission of the copyright holder.
 

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.
      
Parenthetically, your readers might be interested in the substantive discovery here, the details of the Williams admissions process (which is probably very similar to Columbia’s). Williams places students into academic rating (AR) categories as follows:

<p>Introduction: Timothy Noah  reports :
  
At the end of 2007, Harvard announced that it would limit tuition to no more than 10 percent of family income for families earning up to $180,000. (It also eliminated all loans, following a trail blazed by Princeton, and stopped including home equity in its calculations of family wealth.) Yale saw and raised to $200,000, and other wealthy colleges weighed in with variations.
  
Noah argues that this is a bad thing because it encourages other colleges to give tuition breaks to families with six-figure incomes, thus sucking up money that could otherwise go to reduce tuition for lower-income students.  For example:
  
Roger Lehecka, a former dean of students at Columbia, and Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies there, wrote in the New York Times that Harvard’s initiative was “good news for students at Harvard or Yale” but “bad news” for everyone else. “The problem,” they explained, “is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale’s</p><p>5 0.95511127 <a title="1620-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-30-%E2%80%9CPresidential_Election_Outcomes_Directly_Influence_Suicide_Rates%E2%80%9D.html">382 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-30-“Presidential Election Outcomes Directly Influence Suicide Rates”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This came in the spam the other day:
  
College Station, TX–August 16, 2010–Change and hope were central themes to the November 2008 U.S. presidential election. A new longitudinal study published in the September issue of  Social Science Quarterly   analyzes suicide rates at a state level from 1981ï¼2005 and determines that presidential election outcomes directly influence suicide rates among voters.


In states where the majority of voters supported the national election winner suicide rates decreased. However, counter-intuitively, suicide rates decreased even more dramatically in states where the majority of voters supported the election loser (4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 lower for females). This article is the first in its field to focus on candidate and state-specific outcomes in relation to suicide rates. Prior research on this topic focused on whether the election process itself influenced suicide rates, and found that suicide rates fell during the election season.

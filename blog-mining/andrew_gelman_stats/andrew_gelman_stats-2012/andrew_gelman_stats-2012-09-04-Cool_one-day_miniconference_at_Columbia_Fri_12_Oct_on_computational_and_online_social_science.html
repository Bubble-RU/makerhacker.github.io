WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


The Workshop for Women in Machine Learning is a day-long event taking place on the first day of NIPS. 
The workshop aims to showcase the research of women in machine learning and to strengthen their community. 
The event brings together female faculty, graduate students, and research scientists for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in pursuing machine learning research are encouraged to participate. While all presenters will be female, all genders are invited to attend.


Scholarships will be provided to female students and postdoctoral attendees with accepted abstracts to partially offset travel costs.

<p>Introduction: Postdoctoral position in statistical modeling of social networks 
 
A full-time postdoctoral position is available beginning Fall 2014 in the research group of Tian Zheng and Andrew Gelman working on statistical analysis and modeling of social network data, in close cooperation with our experimental collaborators. Four key papers of this project so far are:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/overdisp_final.pdf

http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/DiPreteetal.pdf
 
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2473.pdf
 
Requirements: The work is highly interdisciplinary, and applicants must have strong statistical and computational skills.  Social science research skills are preferred but not necessary. Preferred educational background is a PhD in statistics, computer science, political science, sociology, or a related field. Expertise in Bayesian modeling and computing is required.

<p>Introduction: One thing we do here at the Applied Statistics Center is hold mini-conferences.  The next one looks really cool.  It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods. Together these advances have created an unprecedented opportunity to address longstanding questions in the social sciences, rang</p><p>2 0.89438969 <a title="1481-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram_on_Mandelbrot.html">1784 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram on Mandelbrot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: Here’s some psychology research that’s relevant to  yesterday’s discussion  on working-class voting.  In  a paper  to appear in the journal  Cognitive Science , Andrei Cimpian, Amanda Brandone, and Susan Gelman write:
  
Generic statements (e.g., “Birds lay eggs”) express generalizations about categories. In this paper, we hypothesized that there is a paradoxical asymmetry at the core of generic meaning, such that these sentences have extremely strong implications but require little evidence to be judged true. Four experiments confirmed the hypothesized asymmetry: Participants interpreted novel generics such as “Lorches have purple feathers” as referring to nearly all lorches, but they judged the same novel generics to be true given a wide range of prevalence levels (e.g., even when only 10% or 30% of lorches had purple feathers). A second hypothesis, also confirmed by the results, was that novel generic sentences about dangerous or distinctive properties would be more acceptable than</p><p>5 0.88776779 <a title="1481-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-24-Kaggle_forcasting_update.html">230 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-24-Kaggle forcasting update</a></p>

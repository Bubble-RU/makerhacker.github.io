<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  defines  a Ddulite as follows:
  
A preference for higher tech solutions even in cases where lower tech alternatives have greater and more appropriate functionality; a person of ddulite tendencies.


Though Ddulites are the opposite of Luddites with respect to attitudes toward technology, they occupy more or less the same point with respect to functionality.
  
As a sometime Luddite myself (no cell phone, tv, microwave oven, etc.), I should in fairness point out the logic in favor of being a Ddulite.  Old technology is typically pretty stable; new technology is improving.  It can make sense to switch early (before the new technology actually performs better than the old) to get the benefits of being familiar with the new technology once it does take off.</p><p>3 0.064935386 <a title="1549-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-15-Coaching%2C_teaching%2C_and_writing.html">1380 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-15-Coaching, teaching, and writing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>5 0.063226126 <a title="1549-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Job_openings_in_multilevel_modeling_in_Bristol%2C_England.html">202 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Job openings in multilevel modeling in Bristol, England</a></p>

<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
  
Just to throw some Richard Florida in the mix:  Back in 1990, I  turned down  a job offer from Bell Labs, larg</p><p>3 0.6374445 <a title="1549-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-13-More_Bell_Labs_happy_talk.html">1670 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-13-More Bell Labs happy talk</a></p>

I just read your  review  of Gertnerâ&euro;&trade;s book.  I agree with most of what you say re Bell labs.


I worked in the research area from 1964 to 1992 having arrived in what I regarded as a sort of heaven after 10 years in industrial research elsewhere. For much of that time I headed the Materials Science Research Dept. in the Solid State Electronics Laboratory. For a large number of the senior staff the eight hour day was the exception, not the rule, and even on weekends the parking lot was often 1/4 full. Most of the people I worked with were self driven and loved their work and the opportunities the Labs. provided to be maximally scientifically productive. Even during lunch in the cafeteria productive interactions were a common occurrence. I could go on and on, but just wanted to thank you for bring back pleasant memories of a long and productive career at Bell Labs after 20 years in retirement.

<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.  The input is the heat from solar radiation (easy enough to compute given the trajectory).

<p>Introduction: I read the following under the  headline , Behind a Flop, a Play(wright) Within a Play”:
  
A stroll down West 45th Street in the theater district is all it takes to understand the contradictory fortunes facing David Mamet, for years the heavyweight of bare-knuckled American playwrights, as well as the producers who believe that loyalty to the writer makes good business sense.


At the Schoenfeld Theater is Mr. Mamet’s latest box-office hit: A revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross,” his Pulitzer Prize-winning crowd-pleaser from 1984 about an office of desperately scheming salesmen. The producers are charging up to $377 a ticket simply on the drawing power of their star, Al Pacino, even before its official opening this weekend.
  
My first thought was, Cool!  Mamet wrote a new play called “A revival of ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’” with a play within a play.
 
My second thought was, No way am I paying $377 a ticket for this.  Too bad it’s not more reasonably priced.
 
Then I read the article more ca</p><p>3 0.73876977 <a title="1549-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-26-Impersonators.html">1639 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-26-Impersonators</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This story  of a Cindy Sherman impersonator reminded me of some graffiti I saw in a bathroom of the Whitney Museum many years ago.  My friend Kenny and I had gone there for the Biennial which had an exhibit featuring Keith Haring and others of the neo-taggers (or whatever they were called).  The bathroom walls were all painted over by Kenny Scharf [no relation to my friend] in his characteristically irritating doodle style.  On top of the ugly stylized graffiti was a Sharpie’d scrawl:  “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”
 
I suspected this last bit was added by someone else, but maybe it was Scharf himself?  Ira Glass is a bigshot and can get Cindy Sherman on the phone, but I was just some guy, all I could do was write Scharf a letter, c/o the Whitney Museum.  I described the situation and asked if he was the one who had written, “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”  He did not reply.</p><p>4 0.42797679 <a title="1549-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-16-RSS_mess.html">91 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-16-RSS mess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Apparently some of our new blog entries are appearing as old entries on the RSS feed, meaning that those of you who read the blog using RSS may be missing a lot of good stuff.  We’re working on this.  But, in the meantime, I recommend you click on  the blog itself  to see what’s been posted in the last few weeks.

<p>Introduction: I happened to be looking at Slate (I know, I know, but I’d already browsed Gawker and I was desperately avoiding doing real work) and came across this  article  by Alice Gregory entitled, “I Read Everything Janet Malcolm Ever Published. I’m in awe of her.”
 
I too think Malcolm is an excellent writer, but (a) I’m not happy that she gets off the hook for  faking quotes , and (b) I’m really really not happy with her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.
 
I just can’t get over that, for some reason.  I can appreciate Picasso’s genius even though he beat his wives or whatever it was he did, I can enjoy the music of Jackson Browne, etc.  But for some reason this Malcolm stuff sticks in my craw.  There’s no deep meaning to this—I recognize it is a somewhat irrational attitude on my part, I just wanted to share it with you.</p><p>6 0.33139557 <a title="1549-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi_Google_search_est_devenu_plus_raisonnable%3F.html">207 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi Google search est devenu plus raisonnable?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: As someone who relies strongly on survey research, it’s good for me to be reminded that some surveys are useful, some are useless, but one thing they almost all have in common is . . . they waste the respondents’ time.
 
I thought of this after receiving the following email, which I shall reproduce here.  My own comments appear after.
     
Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10 minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of the email appears below). We are emailing you today to debrief you on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study. We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced. Our hope is that this letter will provide a sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of our study to alleviate any concerns you may have about your involvement.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:

To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A.

<p>Introduction: Gerrit Storms reports on an interesting linguistic research project in which you can participate!  Here’s the description:
  
Over the past few weeks, we have been trying to set up a scientific study that is important for many researchers interested in words, word meaning, semantics, and cognitive science in general.  It is a huge word association project, in which people are asked to participate in a small task that doesn’t last longer than 5 minutes. Our goal is to build a global word association network that contains connections between about 40,000 words, the size of the lexicon of an average adult. Setting up such a network might learn us a lot about semantic memory, how it develops, and maybe also about how it can deteriorate (like in Alzheimer’s disease). Most people enjoy doing the task, but we need thousands of participants to succeed. Up till today, we found about 53,000 participants willing to do the little task, but we need more subjects. That is why we address you.

Regular blog readers know all about this topic.  ( Here  are the slides.)  But, rest assured, I donâ&euro;&trade;t just mock. I also offer constructive suggestions.
 
My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.
 
P.S.  I searched on the web and also found  this announcement  which gives the wrong title.</p><p>2 0.94342422 <a title="1539-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-Huh%3F.html">1915 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-Huh?</a></p>

Applications are now open for the Communicating Science 2013 workshop (http://workshop.astrobites.com/), to be held in Cambridge, MA on June 13-15th, 2013.  Graduate students at US institutions in all fields of science and engineering are encouraged to apply â&euro;&ldquo; funding is available for travel expenses and accommodations.


The application can be found here: http://workshop.astrobites.org/application


Participants will build the communication skills that technical professionals need to express complex ideas to their peers, experts in other fields, and the general public.  There will be panel discussions on the following topics:


* Engaging Non-Scientific Audiences 
* Science Writing for a Cause 
* Communicating Science Through Fiction 
* Sharing Science with Scientists 
* The World of Non-Academic Publishing 
* Communicating using Multimedia and the Web


In addition to these discussions, ample time is allotted for interacting with the experts and with att</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91186047 <a title="1539-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-18-IRB_nightmares.html">1539 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-18-IRB nightmares</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>5 0.9038614 <a title="1539-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Examining_US_Legislative_process_with_%E2%80%9CMany_Bills%E2%80%9D.html">764 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Examining US Legislative process with “Many Bills”</a></p>

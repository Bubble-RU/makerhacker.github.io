As was discussed in the comments thread  awhile ago , there seem to be three possible ways to play Turing chess:
 
1.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return.  Once you sit down to the table, the other player runs around the house.  Then you have to move, etc.  You lose if you are checkmated or if you fail to move before your opponent returns to his chair.
 
2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.
 
3.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs.

</p><p>6 The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs. [sent-15, score-0.351]
</p><p>7 In this version, it’s possible to make two moves in a row. [sent-17, score-0.318]
</p><p>8 It would go like this:  player A moves and starts to run, then player B immediately moves, runs so hard that he catches up to and passes A, then sits down and quickly moves before A gets back. [sent-18, score-1.22]
</p><p>9 (I am excluding all possible rules that involve chess clocks, because to me a key feature of Turing chess is its beautiful simplicity, that the running provides the time control directly. [sent-19, score-1.359]
</p><p>10 I’d guess that in version 1 the dominant strategy would be for both players to be jogging, except maybe for a few points during the game where your opponent has a tough choice to make and it’s worth your effort to sprint to give him less time to think. [sent-22, score-0.901]
</p><p>11 In addition, version 1 has the fatal flaw, at least in theory, that at any time you can simply sit on a stoop halfway around the house and think as long as you want. [sent-23, score-0.755]
</p><p>12 Sure, this would give time to your opponent, too, but if you think you need the time you’d have that opportunity for delay. [sent-24, score-0.192]
</p><p>13 Version 2 is what we played in the park yesterday (ok, not really yesterday, remember that this blog is on a lag). [sent-26, score-0.272]
</p><p>14 The result was a running race with essentially no chess, just exhaustion as we sprinted back and forth. [sent-28, score-0.439]
</p><p>15 Essentially this was bullet chess but it ended when one runner caught up with the other. [sent-29, score-0.698]
</p><p>16 This could make things interesting but it changes the game on the board from chess to a chess variant. [sent-31, score-1.245]
</p><p>17 If you’re the faster runner and you’re close to catching up, you can time things just right and do your two moves. [sent-32, score-0.28]
</p><p>18 The result is that it’s not quite chess anymore. [sent-34, score-0.515]
</p><p>19 Right now I’m thinking that version 1 is the best, if supplemented by a rule saying that you have to run, so that walking, sitting, or standing are not allowed. [sent-35, score-0.292]
</p><p>20 This enforces some minimal level of effort and maximal level of time for each move. [sent-36, score-0.265]

<p>Introduction: Daniel Murell has more thoughts on  Turing chess  (last discussed  here ):
  
When I played with my brother, we had it that if you managed to lap someone while running around the house, then you got an additional move. This means that if you had the option to take the king on your additional move, you could, and doing so won you the game. He was fitter at the time so he slipped in two additional moves over the course of the game. I still won :) I am much better at him at chess though, so I’m sure he would have beaten me had we been more even.


W.r.t. dsquared’s  comment  and your response, I’m not overly concerned about the first move, because you can enforce that white must reach a halfway point or that some time interval elapse before black makes his first move.

<p>Introduction: Knowing of my interest in  Turing run-around-the-house chess , David Lockhart points me to  this :
  
Diving Chess is a chess variant, which is played in a swimming pool. Instead of using chess clocks, each player must submerge themselves underwater during their turn, only to resurface when they are ready to make a move. Players must make a move within 5 seconds of resurfacing (they will receive a warning if not, and three warnings will result in a forfeit). Diving Chess was invented by American Chess Master Etan Ilfeld; the very first exhibition game took place between Ilfeld and former British Chess Champion William Hartston at the Thirdspace gym in Soho on August 2nd, 2011. Hartston won the match which lasted almost two hours such that each player was underwater for an entire hour.</p><p>4 0.39127687 <a title="1473-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-16-Chess_vs._checkers.html">615 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-16-Chess vs. checkers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces. The result is a series of elegant graph problems where the viable paths change with each move of your opponent. To draw an analogy with chess, imagine if moving your knight could allow your opponent’s bishop to move like a rook. Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?

I see you have a blog post about turing chess . . . I’ve seen another reference to it but am unable to find a definitive source. Do you know of a source where I could find out about the history of the idea?
  
My reply:
 
You mean the run-around-the-house thing?  I don’t know where it comes from.  It’s a well known story, if you google Turing chess run around the house you can find lots of references but I don’t know the definitive source.  I can blog and see if anything comes up!
 
I’ve never actually played the game.  I’ll try it outdoors sometime, perhaps.  When I last  posted  on the topic, we had a fun discussion, revealing that the rules are not as clear as one might think.  It makes me wonder if anyone’s thought hard about it and come up with a good set of “official rules.”

<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>6 0.80185932 <a title="1473-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-08-Of_parsing_and_chess.html">1847 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-08-Of parsing and chess</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In honor of the  Olympics , I got my butt over to the park and played run-around-the-house chess for the first time ever.
 
As was discussed in the comments thread  awhile ago , there seem to be three possible ways to play Turing chess:
 
1.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return.  Once you sit down to the table, the other player runs around the house.  Then you have to move, etc.  You lose if you are checkmated or if you fail to move before your opponent returns to his chair.
 
2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.
 
3.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs.  When you return, yo</p><p>2 0.94511175 <a title="1473-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_like_this_cartoon.html">1572 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-10-I don’t like this cartoon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>3 0.93120444 <a title="1473-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-21-BDA3_table_of_contents_%28also_a_new_paper_on_visualization%29.html">1991 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-21-BDA3 table of contents (also a new paper on visualization)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In response to our  recent posting  of Amazon’s offer of Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition at 40% off, some people asked what was in this new edition, with more information beyond the beautiful cover image and the  brief paragraph  I’d posted earlier.
 
 Here’s  the table of contents.  The following sections have all-new material:
 
1.4 New introduction of BDA principles using a simple spell checking example 
2.9 Weakly informative prior distributions 
5.7 Weakly informative priors for hierarchical variance parameters 
7.1-7.4 Predictive accuracy for model evaluation and comparison 
10.6 Computing environments 
11.4 Split R-hat 
11.5 New measure of effective number of simulation draws 
13.7 Variational inference 
13.8 Expectation propagation 
13.9 Other approximations 
14.6 Regularization for regression models 
C.1 Getting started with R and Stan 
C.2 Fitting a hierarchical model in Stan 
C.4 Programming Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in R

<p>Introduction: Alexis Le Nestour writes:
  
How do you test for no effect? I attended a seminar where the person assumed that a non significant difference between groups implied an absence of effect. In that case, the researcher needed to show that two groups were similar before being hit by a shock conditional on some observable variables. The assumption was that the two groups were similar and that the shock was random. What would be the good way to set up a test in that case?


I know you’ve been through that before (http://andrewgelman.com/2009/02/not_statistical/) and there are interesting comments but I wanted to have your opinion on that.
  
My reply:  I think you have to get quantitative here.  How similar is similar?  Don’t let your standard errors drive your research agenda.  Or, to put it another way, what would you do if you had all the data?  If your sample size were 1 zillion, then everything would statistically distinguishable from everything else.  And then you’d have to think about w</p><p>5 0.92981327 <a title="1473-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-11-Data_Visualization_vs._Statistical_Graphics.html">407 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-11-Data Visualization vs. Statistical Graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.

<p>Introduction: Anaface analysis of Michelangelo’s David
 
 
I’ve come across  a paper  that was using “beauty” as one of the predictors. To measure beauty, the authors used  Anaface.com 
 
I don’t trust metrics without trying them on a gold standard first. So, I tried how well Anaface does on something that the arts world considers as one of gold standards of beauty – Michelangelo’s David. My annotation might be imperfect, but David only gets to be only a good 7: his nose is too narrow and his eyes are too close.
 
Of course, I applaud the use of interesting predictors in studies, and Anaface is a better tool than anything I’ve seen before, but maybe we need better metrics!

<p>Introduction: Around these parts we see a continuing flow of unusual claims supported by some statistical evidence.  The claims are varyingly plausible a priori.  Some examples (I won’t bother to supply the links; regular readers will remember these examples and newcomers can find them by searching):
 
- Obesity is contagious 
- People’s names affect where they live, what jobs they take, etc. 
- Beautiful people are more likely to have girl babies 
- More attractive instructors have higher teaching evaluations 
- In a basketball game, it’s better to be behind by a point at halftime than to be ahead by a point 
- Praying for someone without their knowledge improves their recovery from heart attacks 
- A variety of claims about ESP
 
How should we think about these claims?  The usual approach is to evaluate the statistical evidence–in particular, to look for reasons that the claimed results are not really statistically significant.  If nobody can shoot down a claim, it survives.

<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
I remember reading on your blog that you were working on some tools to fit multilevel models that also include “fixed” effects — such as continuous predictors — that are also estimated with shrinkage (for example, an L1 or L2 penalty). Any new developments on this front?


I often find myself wanting to fit a multilevel model to some data, but also needing to include a number of “fixed” effects, mainly continuous variables. This makes me wary of overfitting to these predictors, so then I’d want to use some kind of shrinkage.


As far as I can tell, the main options for doing this now is by going fully Bayesian and using a Gibbs sampler. With MCMCglmm or BUGS/JAGS I could just specify a prior on the fixed effects that corresponds to a desired penalty. However, this is pretty slow, especially with a large data set and because I’d like to select the penalty parameter by cross-validation (which is where this isn’t very Bayesian I guess?).

My topic is regional variation in the cause-specific survival of breast cancer patients across the 21 hospital districts in Finland, this component being modeled by random effects. I am interested mainly in the district-specific effects, and with a hierarchical model I can get reasonable estimates also for sparsely populated districts.


Based on the recommendation given in the book by yourself and Dr. Hill (2007) I tend to think that the finite-population variance would be an appropriate measure to summarize the overall variation across the 21 districts. However, I feel it is somewhat incoherent first to assume a Normal distribution for the district effects, involving a “superpopulation” variance parameter, and then to compute the finite-population variance from the estimated district-specific parameters. I wonder whether the finite-population variance were more appropriate in the context of a model with fixed district effects?

Drew Linzer and I [Tom] have been working on a paper about the use of modeled (“random”) and unmodeled (“fixed”) effects. Not directly in response to the paper, but in conversations about the topic over the past few months, several people have said to us things to the effect of “I prefer fixed effects over random effects because I care about identification.” Neither Drew nor I has any idea what this comment is supposed to mean. Have you come across someone saying something like this? Do you have any thoughts about what these people could possibly mean? I want to respond to this concern when people raise it, but I have failed thus far to inquire what is meant and so do not know what to say.

<p>Introduction: This conference touches nicely on many of the more Biostatistics related topics that have come up on this blog from a pragmatic and perceptive Bayesian perspective.
 
 Fourth Annual Bayesian Biostatistics Conference 
 
Including the star of that recent Cochrane TV debate who will be the key note speaker. 
 
See here  Subtle statistical issues to be debated on TV.  and perhaps the last comment which is my personal take on that debate.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>3 0.90543324 <a title="1513-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>4 0.89386451 <a title="1513-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-Statistical_fact_checking_needed%2C_or%2C_No%2C_Ronald_Reagan_did_not_win_%E2%80%9Coverwhelming_support_from_evangelicals%E2%80%9D.html">143 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-Statistical fact checking needed, or, No, Ronald Reagan did not win “overwhelming support from evangelicals”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>5 0.89135164 <a title="1513-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project_qualifying_exam_process%3A__An_intensified_dialogue_between_students_and_faculty.html">308 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project qualifying exam process:  An intensified dialogue between students and faculty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>6 0.8898977 <a title="1513-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-09-Experimental_work_on_market-based_or_non-market-based_incentives.html">1410 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-09-Experimental work on market-based or non-market-based incentives</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
I am hoping you can give me some advice about when to use fixed and random effects model. I am currently working on a paper that examines the effect of . . . by comparing states . . .


It got reviewed . . . by three economists and all suggest that we run a fixed effects model.  We ran a hierarchial model in the paper that allow the intercept and slope to vary before and after . . . My question is which is correct? We have ran it both ways and really it makes no difference which model you run, the results are very similar. But for my own learning, I would really like to understand which to use under what circumstances.  Is the fact that we use the whole population reason enough to just run a fixed effect model?


Perhaps you can suggest a good reference to this question of when to run a fixed vs. random effects model.
  
I’m not always sure what is meant by a “fixed effects model”; see my paper on Anova for discussion of the problems with this terminology:

<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>4 0.10869864 <a title="1120-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-02-Fixed_effects_and_identification.html">1241 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-02-Fixed effects and identification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tom Clark writes:
  
Drew Linzer and I [Tom] have been working on a paper about the use of modeled (“random”) and unmodeled (“fixed”) effects. Not directly in response to the paper, but in conversations about the topic over the past few months, several people have said to us things to the effect of “I prefer fixed effects over random effects because I care about identification.” Neither Drew nor I has any idea what this comment is supposed to mean. Have you come across someone saying something like this? Do you have any thoughts about what these people could possibly mean? I want to respond to this concern when people raise it, but I have failed thus far to inquire what is meant and so do not know what to say.
  
My reply:
 
I have a “cultural” reply, which is that so-called fixed effects are thought to make fewer assumptions, and making fewer assumptions is considered a generally good thing that serious people do, and identification is considered a concern of serious people, so they g</p><p>5 0.10408382 <a title="1120-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-17-How_to_make_a_good_fig%3F.html">1382 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-17-How to make a good fig?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In an ideal world, research articles would be open to criticism and discussion in the same place where they are published, in a sort of non-corrupt version of Yelp.  What is happening now is that the occasional paper or research area gets lots of press coverage, and this inspires reactions on science-focused blogs.  The trouble here is that it’s easier to give off-the-cuff comments than detailed criticisms.
 
Here’s an example.  It starts a couple years ago with  this article  by Ryota Kanai, Tom Feilden, Colin Firth, and Geraint Rees, on brain size and political orientation:
  
In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants.

<p>Introduction: Panos Ipeirotis  writes in his blog  post :
  

Everyone who has attended a conference knows that the quality of the talks is very uneven. There are talks that are highly engaging, entertaining, and describe nicely the research challenges and solutions. And there are talks that are a waste of time. Either the presenter cannot present clearly, or the presented content is impossible to digest within the time frame of the presentation.


We already have reviewing for the written part. The program committee examines the quality of the written  paper and vouch for its technical content. However, by looking at a paper it is impossible to know how nicely it can be presented. Perhaps the seemingly solid but boring paper can be a very entertaining presentation. Or an excellent paper may be written by a horrible presenter.


Why not having a second round of reviewing, where the authors of accepted papers submit their presentations (slides and a YouTube video) for presentation to the conference.</p><p>5 0.75945914 <a title="1120-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t_think_of_it_as_duplication._Think_of_it_as_a_single_paper_in_a_superposition_of_two_quantum_journals.%E2%80%9D.html">1654 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-“Don’t think of it as duplication.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>6 0.74651468 <a title="1120-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-28-Explaining_that_plot..html">631 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-28-Explaining that plot.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An experimental psychologist was wondering about the standards in that field for “acceptable reliability” (when looking at inter-rater reliability in coding data).  He wondered, for example, if some variation on signal detectability theory might be applied to adjust for inter-rater differences in criteria for saying some code is present.
 
What about Cohen’s kappa?  The psychologist wrote:
  
Cohen’s kappa does adjust for “guessing,” but its assumptions are not well motivated, perhaps not any more than adjustments for guessing versus the application of signal detectability theory where that can be applied. But one can’t do a straightforward application of signal detectability theory for reliability in that you don’t know whether the signal is present or not.
  
I think measurement issues are important but I don’t have enough experience in this area to answer the question without knowing more about the problem that this researcher is working on.

<p>Introduction: We have lots of models for overdispersed count data but we rarely see underdispersed data.  But now I know what example I’ll be giving when this next comes up in class.  From a  book review  by Theo Tait:
  
A number of shark species go in for oophagy, or uterine cannibalism. Sand tiger foetuses ‘eat each other in utero, acting out the harshest form of sibling rivalry imaginable’. Only two babies emerge, one from each of the mother shark’s uteruses: the survivors have eaten everything else. ‘A female sand tiger gives birth to a baby that’s already a metre long and an experienced killer,’ explains Demian Chapman, an expert on the subject.
  
That’s what I call underdispersion.  E(y)=2, var(y)=0.  Take that, M.

<p>Introduction: That’s ok , Krugman earlier  slammed  Galbraith.  (I wonder if Krugman is as big a fan of “tough choices” now as he was  in 1996 .)  Given Krugman’s politicization in recent years, I’m surprised he’s so dismissive of the political (rather than technical-economic) nature of Hayek’s influence.  (I don’t know if he’s changed his views on Galbraith in recent years.)
 
P.S.  Greg Mankiw, in contrast,  labels  Galbraith and Hayek as “two of the great economists of the 20th century” and writes, “even though their most famous works were written many decades ago, they are still well worth reading today.”</p><p>4 0.925982 <a title="1120-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-06-One_reason_New_York_isn%E2%80%99t_as_rich_as_it_used_to_be%3A__Redistribution_of_federal_tax_money_to_other_states.html">1485 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-06-One reason New York isn’t as rich as it used to be:  Redistribution of federal tax money to other states</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>5 0.9198451 <a title="1120-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-19-Will_Stan_work_well_with_40%C3%9740_matrices%3F.html">861 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-19-Will Stan work well with 40×40 matrices?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tomas Iesmantas writes:
  
I’m dealing with high dimensional (40-50 parameters) hierarchical bayesian model applied to nonlinear Poisson regression problem.


Now I’m using an adaptive version for the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm with a truncated drift (Yves F. Atchade, 2003) to obtain samples from posterior.


But this algorithm is not very efficient in my case, it needs several millions iterations as burn-in period. And simulation takes quite a long time, since algorithm has to work with 40×40 matrices.


Maybe you know another MCMC algorithm which could take not so many burn-in samples and would be able to deal with nonlinear regression? In non-hierarchical nonlinear regression model adaptive metropolis algorithm is enough, but in hierarchical case I could use something more effective.
  
My reply:
 
Try fitting the model in Stan.  If that doesn’t work, let me know.</p><p>6 0.91210455 <a title="1120-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-19-Tempering_and_modes.html">1018 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-19-Tempering and modes</a></p>

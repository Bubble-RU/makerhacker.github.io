<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog will know that I’m always on the lookout for new items for the  lexicon .  It’s been a good month on that front.  In addition to the Garden of Forking Paths, I’ve encountered two entirely new (to me) fallacies.
 
The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!
 
Here’s the story.  The other day on the sister blog I  reported  on a pair of studies involving children and political orientation:  Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely</p><p>3 0.13375552 <a title="1391-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-08-Different_attitudes_about_parenting%2C_possibly_deriving_from_different_attitudes_about_self.html">564 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-08-Different attitudes about parenting, possibly deriving from different attitudes about self</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  discusses  his and Bryan Caplan’s reaction to that notorious book by Amy Chua, the Yale law professor who boasts of screaming at her children, calling them “garbage,” not letting them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano, etc.  Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel.  Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes).

<p>Introduction: Philip Cohen  asks , “Why are mothers becoming moms?”  These aren’t just two words for the same thing:  in political terms “mother” is merely descriptive while “mom” is more positive.  Indeed, we speak of “mom and apple pie” as unquestionable American icons.
 
Cohen points out that motherhood is sometimes but not always respected in political discourse:
  
On the one hand, both President Obama and pundit Hilary Rosen have now called motherhood the world’s hardest job. And with the Romneys flopping onto the all-mothers-work bandwagon, it appears we’re reaching a rare rhetorical consensus.


On the other hand, the majority in both major political parties agrees that poor single mothers and their children need one thing above all – a (real) job, one that provides the “dignity of an honest day’s work.” For welfare purposes, taking care of children is not only not the toughest job in the world, it is more akin to nothing at all.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: From “Judge Savage,” by Tim Parks:
  
That evening, Daniel called Hilary’s parents.  These people always disliked me, he knew.  He had never understood if it was a racial thing, or whether they would have disliked any partner of Hilary’s.
  
Very clever.  Parks demonstrates Daniel’s blind spot–he can’t imagine that maybe Hilary’s parents hate him because of his unpleasant personality–but does it entirely from Daniel’s perspective.  I wonder if this just came naturally to Parks, or whether he figured it out as a puzzle to solve–how to convey a blind spot from the perspective of the person looking and not noticing it–or whether Parks wasn’t thinking at all about this and it just happened.
 
Considering the character Daniel’s psychology, I’d consider the above as an example of the so-called fundamental attribution error, in that he’s attributing Hilary’s parents dislike of him to situational factors rather than to his own personality.

I was looking at baby name data last night and I stumbled upon something curious. I follow the  baby names blog  occasionally but not regularly, so I’m not sure if it’s been noticed before. Let me present it like this:  Take the statement…


Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.


(… You can pause and try to guess now. Spoilers to follow.)


Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier).

<p>Introduction: I recently finished two enjoyable novels that I was pretty sure I’d like, given that they were both sequels of a sort.  The main characters of both books were named Milo, a name that in literature appears only (to my knowledge) in The Phantom Tollbooth and Catch-22.
 
The Milos in the new books I just read are much different than the two classic literary Milos.  One, featured in the new thriller by  Olen Steinhauer , is a cool, effective CIA killing machine (but of the good-guy variety, also he has some little character flaws to make him tolerable but he’s basically a superhero).  The other is not any sort of killing machine, more of more of a Sam Lipsyte character.  Which makes sense since he’s the star of The Ask, the follow-up to Lipsyte’s hilarious lovable-loser saga, Home Land.
 
I have two questions about The Ask.
 
1.  The driver of the plot is as follows.  Milo has just been fired from his crappy job at a college in NYC.  Milo has a rich friend who asks him to do a favor; in re</p><p>6 0.67404115 <a title="1391-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-05-Taking_philosophical_arguments_literally.html">17 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-05-Taking philosophical arguments literally</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>2 0.87803572 <a title="1391-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-30-History_is_too_important_to_be_left_to_the_history_professors%2C_Part_2.html">2192 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-30-History is too important to be left to the history professors, Part 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Completely non-gay historian Niall Ferguson, a man who  we can be sure  would never be caught at a ballet or a poetry reading,  informs us  that the British decision to enter the first world war on the side of France and Belgium was “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
Ummm, here are a few bigger errors: 
   
The German decision to invade Russia in 1941.
 
The Japanese decision to attack America in 1941.
 
 Oh yeah , the German decision to invade Belgium in 1914.
 
The Russian decision to invade Afghanistan in 1981 doesn’t look like such a great decision either.
 
And it wasn’t so smart for Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, but maybe the countries involved were too small for this to count as “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
It’s striking that, in considering the biggest error in modern history, Ferguson omits all these notorious acts of aggression (bombing Pearl Harbor, leading to the destruction of much of your country, that was pretty bad, huh?), and decides that the worst</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87049466 <a title="1391-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-25-A_question_about_the_Tiger_Mom%3A__what_if_she%E2%80%99d_had_boys_instead_of_girls%3F.html">1391 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-25-A question about the Tiger Mom:  what if she’d had boys instead of girls?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about that Yale professor who wrote that book,  remember , she screamed at her daughters all the time and didn’t let them go the bathroom while they were practicing piano (violin?), Asian parenting-style etc etc.
 
I was just wondering . . . what if she’d had sons rather than daughters?  What are the rules?  Would bringing up boys be the job of mellow white dad rather than intense Asian mom?  If mom were still in charge, would the boys be doing piano, or something else like hockey?  Tiger Mom seems to be into traditional values so I’m assuming she’d want her kids doing something sex-stereotyped?  But sports would be tough, her (hypothetical) boys would have to compete with big strong athletes and would be less likely to be winners so then she couldn’t brag about her amazing parenting skills.
 
I really don’t know the answer to this one.  Maybe some of our readers who are Yale law professors can enlighten us?</p><p>4 0.86266488 <a title="1391-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-The_Fixie_Bike_Index.html">1127 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-The Fixie Bike Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>5 0.85299397 <a title="1391-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-The_Subtle_Micro-Effects_of_Peacekeeping.html">242 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-The Subtle Micro-Effects of Peacekeeping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>6 0.85290074 <a title="1391-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-19-Prose_is_paragraphs%2C_prose_is_sentences.html">1863 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-19-Prose is paragraphs, prose is sentences</a></p>

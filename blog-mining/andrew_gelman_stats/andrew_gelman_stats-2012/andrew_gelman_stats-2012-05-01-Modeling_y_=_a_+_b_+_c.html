<p>Introduction: Andreas Graefe writes (see  here   here   here ):
  
The usual procedure for developing linear models to predict any kind of target variable is to identify a subset of most important predictors and to estimate weights that provide the best possible solution for a given sample. The resulting “optimally” weighted linear composite is then used when predicting new data. This approach is useful in situations with large and reliable datasets and few predictor variables. However, a large body of analytical and empirical evidence since the 1970s shows that the weighting of variables is of little, if any, value in situations with small and noisy datasets and a large number of predictor variables. In such situations, including all relevant variables is more important than their weighting. These findings have yet to impact many fields.

I am currently using the iterative regression imputation model as implemented in the Stata ICE package. I am using data from a survey of about 90,000 students in 142 schools and my variable of interest is parent level of education. I want only this variable to be imputed with as little bias as possible as I am not using any other variable. So I scoured the survey for every variable I thought could possibly predict parent education. The main variable I found is parent occupation, which explains about 35% of the variance in parent education for the students with complete data on both. I then include the 20 other variables I found in the survey in a regression predicting parent education, which explains about 40% of the variance in parent education for students with complete data on all the variables.

<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>5 0.80885357 <a title="1294-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-04-What_are_the_key_assumptions_of_linear_regression%3F.html">1967 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-04-What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a></p>

A link to an  article , “Four Assumptions Of Multiple Regression That Researchers Should Always Test”, has been making  the rounds  on Twitter.  Their first rule is “Variables are Normally distributed.”  And they seem to be talking about the independent variables – but then later bring in tests on the residuals (while admitting that the normally-distributed error assumption is a weak assumption).  


I thought we had long-since moved away from transforming our independent variables to make them normally distributed for statistical reasons (as opposed to standardizing them for interpretability, etc.)  Am I missing something?  I agree that leverage in a influence is important, but normality of the variables? The article is from 2002, so it might be dated, but given the popularity of the tweet, I thought I’d ask your opinion.

<p>Introduction: Commenters here are occasionally bothered that I spend so much time attacking frauds and plagiarists.  See, for example,  here  and  here .  Why go on and on about these losers, given that there are more important problems in the world such as war, pestilence, hunger, and graphs where the y-axis doesn’t go all the way down to zero?
 
Part of the story is that I do research for a living so I resent people who devalue research through misattribution or fraud, in the same way that rich people don’t like counterfeiters.
 
What really bugs me, though, is when cheaters get caught and still don’t admit it.  People like Hauser, Wegman, Fischer, and Weick get under my skin because they have the chutzpah to just deny deny deny.  The grainy time-stamped videotape with their hand in the cookie jar is right there, and they’ll still talk around the problem.  Makes me want to scream.
 
This happens  all the time .  All. Over. The. Place.

I [Behlendorf] am replicating some previous research using OLS [he's talking about what we call "linear regression"---ed.] to regress a logged rate (to reduce skew) of Y on a number of predictors (Xs).  Y is the count of a phenomena divided by the population of the unit of the analysis.  The problem that I am encountering is that Y is composite count of a number of distinct phenomena [A+B+C], and these phenomena are not uniformly distributed across the sample.   Most of the research in this area has conducted regressions either with Y or with individual phenomena [A or B or C] as the dependent variable.  Yet it seems that if [A, B, C] are not uniformly distributed across the sample of units in the same proportion, then the use of Y would be biased, since as a count of [A+B+C] divided by the population, it would treat as equivalent units both [2+0.5+1.5] and [4+0+0].

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll points to  this  ten-year-old article from Anne-Wil Harzing on the consequences of sloppy citations.  Harzing tells the story of an unsupported claim that is contradicted by published data but has been presented as fact in a particular area of the academic literature.  She writes that “high expatriate failure rates [with "expatriate failure" defined as "the expatriate returning home before his/her contractual period of employment abroad expires"] were in fact a myth created by massive misquotations and careless copying of references.”  Many papers claimed an expatriate failure rate of 25-40% (according to Harzing, this is much higher than the actual rate as estimated from empirical data), with this overly-high rate supported by a complicated link of references leading to . . . no real data.
 
Hartzing reports the following published claims:

<p>Introduction: We all have opinions about the federal budget and how it should be spent. Infrequently, those opinions are informed by some knowledge about where the money actually goes.  It turns out that most people don’t have a clue.  What about you?  Here, take this poll/quiz and then compare your answers to (1) what other people said, in a CNN poll that asked about these same items and (2) compare your answers to the real answers.
 
Quiz is below the fold.
  

 
The questions below are from  a CNN poll.

Think about all the money that the federal government spent last year. I’m going to name a few federal programs and for each one, I’d like you to estimate what percentage of the federal government’s budget last year was spent on each of those programs.
  
 Medicare — the federal health program for the elderly 
 Medicaid — the federal health program for the poor 
 Social Security 
 Military spending by the Department of Defense 
 Aid to foreign countries for international development</p><p>6 0.89511496 <a title="1294-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-09-Frontiers_of_Science_update.html">1890 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-09-Frontiers of Science update</a></p>

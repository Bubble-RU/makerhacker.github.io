<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).  Each of the plots overlays data from several databases (not necessarily indepenedent of each other), and you can select which ones to include or leave</p><p>3 0.1261501 <a title="1424-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>4 0.10568574 <a title="1424-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-31-Skepticism_about_skepticism_of_global_warming_skepticism_skepticism.html">983 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-31-Skepticism about skepticism of global warming skepticism skepticism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A group of University of California professors headed by physicist Richard Muller recently released a  report  confirming global warming.  Then geophysicist Judith Curry, a coauthor on the papers produced by the Muller group, turned around and  said  that their data actually show that global warming has stopped.  (Also see clarification  here .)
 
Curry is described in the news article as the second author on the papers, but the authors are listed alphabetically so it’s probably more accurate to describe her as one of the ten authors.  Muller’s one, Curry’s another, . . . now I want to know what 7 of the other 8 authors think!  (One of the authors is Richard Muller’s daughter Elizabeth, so maybe we shouldn’t count her as an independent view.)
 
Some enterprising reporter should really interview the other 7 authors of  that report .  Just a quick question like, “Is there scientific basis for saying that warming hasn’t stopped?”

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: I hate to keep bumping our scheduled posts but this is just too important and too exciting to wait.  So it’s time to jump the queue.
 
 
 
The news is  a paper from Michael Betancourt  that presents a super-cool new way to compute normalizing constants:
  
A common strategy for inference in complex models is the relaxation of a simple model into the more complex target model, for example the prior into the posterior in Bayesian inference. Existing approaches that attempt to generate such transformations, however, are sensitive to the pathologies of complex distributions and can be difficult to implement in practice. Leveraging the geometry of thermodynamic processes I introduce a principled and robust approach to deforming measures that presents a powerful new tool for inference.
  
The idea is to generalize Hamiltonian Monte Carlo so that it moves through a family of distributions (that is, it transitions through an “inverse temperature” variable called beta that indexes the family) a</p><p>4 0.64345056 <a title="1424-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-18-More_studies_on_the_economic_effects_of_climate_change.html">1501 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-18-More studies on the economic effects of climate change</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After writing  yesterday’s post , I was going through Solomon Hsiang’s blog and found  a post  pointing to three studies from researchers at business schools:
  
Severe Weather and Automobile Assembly Productivity


Gérard P. Cachon, Santiago Gallino and Marcelo Olivares


Abstract: It is expected that climate change could lead to an increased frequency of severe weather. In turn, severe weather intuitively should hamper the productivity of work that occurs outside. But what is the effect of rain, snow, fog, heat and wind on work that occurs indoors, such as the production of automobiles? Using weekly production data from 64 automobile plants in the United States over a ten-year period, we ﬁnd that adverse weather conditions lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in production. For example, one additional day of high wind advisory by the National Weather Service (i.e., maximum winds generally in excess of 44 miles per hour) reduces production by 26%, which is comparable in order of magnitude t</p><p>5 0.60509384 <a title="1424-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-07-Inference_%3D_data_%2B_model.html">1201 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-07-Inference = data + model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  recent article  on global warming reminded me of the difficulty of letting the data speak.  William Nordhaus shows the following graph: 
   
   
 
And then he writes:
  
One of the reasons that drawing conclusions on temperature trends is tricky is that the historical temperature series is highly volatile, as can be seen in the figure. The presence of short-term volatility requires looking at long-term trends. A useful analogy is the stock market. Suppose an analyst says that because real stock prices have declined over the last decade (which is true), it follows that there is no upward trend. Here again, an examination of the long-term data would quickly show this to be incorrect. The last decade of temperature and stock market data is not representative of the longer-term trends.


The finding that global temperatures are rising over the last century-plus is one of the most robust findings of climate science and statistics.

<p>Introduction: 1.  Freakonomics  characterizes  drunk driving as an example of “the human tendency to worry about rare problems that are unlikely to happen.”
 
2.  The CDC  reports , “Alcohol-impaired drivers are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.”
 
No offense to the tenured faculty at the University of Chicago, but I’m going with the CDC on this one. 
   
P.S.  The Freakonomics blog deserves to be dinged another time, not just for claiming, based on  implausible assumptions  and making the all-else-equal  fallacy  that “drunk walking is 8 times more likely to result in your death than drunk driving” but for presenting this weak inference as a fact rather than as a speculation.
 
When doing “Freakonomics,” you can be counterintuitive, or you can be sensible, but it’s hard to be both. I mean, sure, sometimes you can be. But there’s a tradeoff, and in this case, they’re choosing to push the envelope on counterintuitiveness.</p><p>3 0.94181395 <a title="1424-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Question_21_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1356 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Question 21 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions.. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
 
 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.9301194 <a title="1424-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-22-Extreme_events_as_evidence_for_differences_in_distributions.html">1424 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-22-Extreme events as evidence for differences in distributions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think  Lawrence Summers  would like this  paper  by James Hansen, Makiko Sato, and Reto Ruedy (link from  Krugman  via  Palko ).  Hansen et al. write:
  
The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations (σ) warmer than climatology. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1% of Earth’s surface in the period of climatology, now typically covers about 10% of the land area.


   
  
The point is that it makes sense to look at the whole distribution, but extreme events provide information also.
 
P.S.   Here  are some papers by my Columbia colleague Wolfram Schenkler on potential impacts of global warming on agriculture.</p><p>5 0.92783558 <a title="1424-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-30-Systematic_review_of_publication_bias_in_studies_on_publication_bias.html">1291 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-30-Systematic review of publication bias in studies on publication bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>6 0.92216498 <a title="1424-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-%E2%80%9CCity_Opens_Inquiry_on_Grading_Practices_at_a_Top-Scoring_Bronx_School%E2%80%9D.html">529 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-“City Opens Inquiry on Grading Practices at a Top-Scoring Bronx School”</a></p>

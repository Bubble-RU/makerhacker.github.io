<p>Introduction: I was talking with someone the other day about the book by that Yale law professor who called her kids “garbage” and didn’t let them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano . . . apparently it wasn’t so bad as all that, she was  misrepresented  by the Wall Street Journal excerpt:
  
“I was very surprised,” she says. “The Journal basically strung together the most controversial sections of the book. And I had no idea they’d put that kind of a title on it. . . . “And while it’s ultimately my responsibility — my strict Chinese mom told me ‘never blame other people for your problems!’ — the one-sided nature of the excerpt has really led to some major misconceptions about what the book says, and about what I really believe.”
  
I don’t completely follow her reasoning here:  just because, many years ago, her mother told her a slogan about not blaming other people, therefore she can say, “it’s ultimately my responsibility”?  You can see the illogic of this by flipping it around.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog comments made me rethink how to express disagreement when I write.  I’ll first display my original blog entry, then some of the comments, then my reaction, and finally my new approach.  As usual with negative comments, my first reaction was to be upset, but once the hurt feelings went away, I realized that these dudes had a point.
 
 Act 1 
 
A few days I ago, I posted the following on 538:
  
Self-described “ political operative ” Les Francis, with real-world experience as former executive director of the Democratic National Committee:

 
I don’t need any polls to tell me that Republicans will do well in November. The “out” party almost always shows significant gains in the first midterm election of a new President. 
 

 Political scientists  Joe Bafumi, Bob Erikson, and Chris Wlezien, from elite, out-of-touch, ivory-tower institutions Dartmouth, Columbia, and Temple Universities:


   


Game over.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Psychologists perform experiments on Canadian undergraduate psychology students and draws conclusions that (they believe) apply to humans in general; they publish in Science. A drug company decides to embark on additional trials that will cost tens of millions of dollars based on the results of a careful double-blind study….whose patients are all volunteers from two hospitals. A movie studio holds 9 screenings of a new movie for volunteer viewers and, based on their survey responses, decides to spend another $8 million to re-shoot the ending.  A researcher interested in the effect of ventilation on worker performance conducts a months-long study in which ventilation levels are varied and worker performance is monitored…in a single building.
 
In almost all fields of research, most studies are based on convenience samples, or on random samples from a larger population that is itself a convenience sample. The paragraph above gives just a few examples.  The benefit</p><p>5 0.11587085 <a title="1640-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-26-The_quals_and_the_quants.html">1083 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-26-The quals and the quants</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I recently  criticized  Gregg Easterbrook for assigning Obama an implausible 90+% chance of beating Mitt Romney, some commenters thought I was being too critical, that I should cut Easterbrook some slack because he just was speaking metaphorically.
 
In other words, Easterbrook is a “qual.”  He uses numbers in his writing because that’s what everyone is supposed to do nowadays, but he doesn’t intend those numbers to be meant literally.  Similarly, he presumably didn’t really mean it when he  wrote  that Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren “couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.”  And he had no problem  typing  that Obama’s approval rating was 23% because, to him, “23%” is just another word for “low.”
 
He’s a qual, that’s all.
 
Similarly, when Samantha Power was just being a qual when she wrote the meaningful-sounding but actually empty statement, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican pres</p><p>6 0.11425503 <a title="1640-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>3 0.81361401 <a title="1640-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-26-The_quals_and_the_quants.html">1083 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-26-The quals and the quants</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Sam Behseta, the new editor of Chance magazine, asked me if I’d like to have a column.  I said yes, I’d like to write on ethics and statistics.  My  first column  was called “Open Data and Open Methods” and I discussed the ethical obligation to share data and make our computations transparent wherever possible.  In my column, I recounted a story from a bit over 20 years ago when I noticed a problem in a published analysis (involving electromagnetic fields and calcium flow in chicken brains) and contacted the researcher in charge of the study, who would not share his data with me.
 
Two of the people from that research team—biologist Carl Blackman and statistician Dennis House—saw my Chance column and felt that I had misrepresented the situation and had criticized them unfairly.
 
Blackman and House expressed their concerns in letters to the editor which were just published, along with my reply, in the latest issue of  Chance .

<p>Introduction: I’m a physicist by training, statistical data analyst by trade.  Although some of my work is pretty standard statistical analysis, more often I work somewhere in a gray area that includes physics, engineering, and statistics. I have very little formal statistics training but I do study in an academic-like way to learn techniques from the literature when I need to.  I do some things well but there are big gaps in my stats knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in statistics.  On the other hand, there are big gaps in most statisticians’ physics and engineering knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in physics. Generally my breadth and depth of knowledge is about right for the kind of work that I do, I think. 
 
But last week I was offered a consulting job that might be better done by someone with more conventional stats knowledge than I have.  The job involves gene expression in different types of tumors, so it’s “biostatistics” by definition, but the</p><p>6 0.79183674 <a title="1640-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-How_can_news_reporters_avoid_making_mistakes_when_reporting_on_technical_issues%3F__Or%2C_Data_used_to_justify_%E2%80%9CData_Used_to_Justify_Health_Savings_Can_Be_Shaky%E2%80%9D_can_be_shaky.html">66 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-How can news reporters avoid making mistakes when reporting on technical issues?

<p>Introduction: On this blog I’ve occasionally written about the problems that arise when economists act as amateur psychologists.  But the problem can go the other way, too.  For example, consider  this blog  by Berit Brogaard and Kristian Marlow ( link  from Abbas Raza).  Brogaard and Marlow give several amusing stories about ripoffs (a restaurant that scams customers into buying expensive bottles of wine, a hairdresser that sucks customers into unnecessary treatments, a ghostwriter who takes thousands of dollars in payments and doesn’t do the job, etc.).  Then they ask, “How did it happen? Why did you act in this impulsive way? Why didn’t you learn your lesson the first time around? Do you have some kind of brain damage?”
 
They continue with some discussion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula, etc etc etc., and then conclude with the following advice:

I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>same-blog 5 0.95862347 <a title="1640-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-26-What_do_people_do_wrong%3F__WSJ_columnist_is_looking_for_examples%21.html">1640 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-26-What do people do wrong?

I’m working on a column this week about numerical/statistical tips and resolutions for writers and people in other fields in the new year. 2013 is the International Year of Statistics, so I’d like to offer some ways to better grapple with statistics in the year ahead. Here’s where you come in. If you have time in the next couple of days, please send me an idea or three about what people often do incorrectly when it comes to numbers, and how they could do better, without making things much more complicated. Maybe with an example of something you’ve seen that rubbed you the wrong way, and how you’d fix it. Bonus if you can tie it in to some sort of statistic that will be particularly relevant in 2013.


Any ideas of yours I use, I’ll credit, of course.

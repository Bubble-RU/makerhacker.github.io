From  yesterday :
  
15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well. Come up with a scheme for inverse-probability weights (ignoring nonresponse and assuming there is exactly one phone line per household).

<p>Introduction: Vishnu Ganglani writes:
  
It appears that multiple imputation appears to be the best way to impute missing data because of the more accurate quantification of variance. However, when imputing missing data for income values in national household surveys, would you recommend it would be practical to maintain the multiple datasets associated with multiple imputations, or a single imputation method would suffice. I have worked on household survey projects (in Scotland) and in the past gone with suggesting single methods for ease of implementation, but with the availability of open source R software I am think of performing multiple imputation methodologies, but a bit apprehensive because of the complexity and also the need to maintain multiple datasets (ease of implementation).
  
My reply:  In many applications I’ve just used a single random imputation to avoid the awkwardness of working with multiple datasets.

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

<p>Introduction: 16. You are doing a survey in a war-torn country to estimate what percentage of unemployed men support the rebels in a civil war. Express this as a ratio estimation problem, where goal is to estimate Y.bar/X.bar.  What are x and y here? Give the estimate and standard error for the percentage of unemployed men who support the rebels.
 
 Solution to question 15 
 
From  yesterday :
  
15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well. Come up with a scheme for inverse-probability weights (ignoring nonresponse and assuming there is exactly one phone line per household).

 Solution to question 14 
 
From  yesterday :
  
14. A public health survey of elderly Americans includes many questions, including “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” and also several questions about current mobility and health status. Response rates are high for the questions about recent activities and status, but there is a lot of nonresponse for the question on past activity. You are considering imputing the mis</p><p>3 0.86074519 <a title="1345-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-16-A_poll_that_throws_away_data%3F%3F%3F.html">1940 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-16-A poll that throws away data???</a></p>

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW. Wondering how many interviews they discarded to get down to 601 completes? Because @ppppolls discards a LOT of interviews.

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>5 0.85836375 <a title="1345-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-11-Yes%2C_the_decision_to_try_%28or_not%29_to_have_a_child_can_be_made_rationally.html">1758 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-11-Yes, the decision to try (or not) to have a child can be made rationally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>6 0.85322046 <a title="1345-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Help_with_this_problem%2C_win_valuable_prizes.html">1164 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Help with this problem, win valuable prizes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups. In Europe, the poor and those on the left of the political spectru</p><p>4 0.1227304 <a title="1300-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-23-Surveys_show_Americans_are_populist_class_warriors%2C_except_when_they_aren%E2%80%99t.html">1079 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-23-Surveys show Americans are populist class warriors, except when they aren’t</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From my  New York Times blog  today, here’s an example of how contemporaneous poll results can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
 
Recently in the New Republic,  William Galston  shared some recent findings from Gallup:
  
Respondents were asked to categorize three economic objectives as extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not important. Here’s what they said:


Extremely/very important          Somewhat/not important


Grow and expand the economy                                         82                                            18


Increase equality of opportunity for people to get ahead                                             70                                            30


Reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and the poor                                  46                                            54


 


When Gallup asked a sample of Americans in 1998 whether the gap between the rich and the poor was a problem that needed t</p><p>5 0.11213751 <a title="1300-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-18-American_Beliefs_about_Economic_Opportunity_and_Income_Inequality.html">666 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-18-American Beliefs about Economic Opportunity and Income Inequality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Leslie McCall spoke in the sociology department here the other day to discuss changes in attitudes about income inequality as well as changes in attitudes about attitudes about income inequality.  (That is, she talked about what survey respondents say, and she talked about what scholars have said about what survey respondents say.)
 
On the plus side, the talk was interesting.  On the downside, I had to leave right at the start of the discussion so I didn’t have a chance to ask my questions.  So I’m placing them below.
 
I can’t find a copy of McCall’s slides so I’ll link to  this recent op-ed  she wrote on the topic of “Rising Wealth Inequality: Should We Care?”  Her title was “Americans Aren’t Naive,” and she wrote:

<p>Introduction: The other day I posted  some comments  on the voting patterns of rich and poor in the context of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart.”  My graphs on income and voting are just fine, but I mischaracterized Murray’s statements.  So I want to fix that right away.  After that I have some thoughts on the book itself.
 
In brief:
 
1. I was unfair to call him a Tucker Carlson.
 
2. Murray talks a lot about upper-class liberals. That’s fine but I think his discussion would be improved by also considering upper-class conservatives, given that I see the big culture war occurring within the upper class.
 
3. Using the case of Joe Paterno as an example, I discuss why Murray’s “preach what you practice” advice could be difficult to carry out in practice. 
   
 Murray on the top 5% 
 
David Frum  quoted  Murray as writing that the top 5% “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it. Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”  In response, Frum and I both pointed out t</p><p>3 0.73769325 <a title="1300-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-08-Charles_Murray_%5Bperhaps%5D_does_a_Tucker_Carlson%2C_provoking_me_to_unleash_the_usual_torrent_of_graphs.html">1159 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-08-Charles Murray [perhaps] does a Tucker Carlson, provoking me to unleash the usual torrent of graphs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Charles Murray wrote a much-discussed new book, “Coming Apart:  The State of White America, 1960-2010.”
 
David Frum  quotes  Murray as writing, in an echo of now-forgotten TV personality  Tucker Carlson , that the top 5% of incomes “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it.  Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”
 
[I’ve interjected a “perhaps” into the title of this blog post to indicate that I don’t have the exact Murray quote here so I’m relying on David Frum’s interpretation.]
 
Frum does me the favor of citing Red State Blue State as evidence, and I’d like to back this up with some graphs.
 
Frum writes:
  
Say “top 5%” to Murray, and his imagination conjures up everything he dislikes: coastal liberals listening to NPR in their Lexus hybrid SUVs. He sees that image so intensely that no mere number can force him to remember that the top 5% also includes the evangelical Christian assistant coach of a state university football team. . . .

<p>Introduction: So  asks  James Ledbetter in Slate.
 
And  the answer is  . . . No!
 
Here’s what happened in 2008:
 
 
 
OK, that’s how people vote.  How bout party identification and ideology?   Check these out :

And here it is,  sliced a different way :
 
   
 
Of, if you want to see it in map form, check out  this article  (with Daniel and Yair).
 
P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

Let me restate that: I live in the only state where a baby girl is more likely to be named Margaret than Nevaeh.
  
Wow.

<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>4 0.8965565 <a title="1300-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-16-The_lamest%2C_grudgingest%2C_non-retraction_retraction_ever.html">1626 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-16-The lamest, grudgingest, non-retraction retraction ever</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>5 0.89026469 <a title="1300-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Of_forecasts_and_graph_theory_and_characterizing_a_statistical_method_by_the_information_it_uses.html">1214 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Of forecasts and graph theory and characterizing a statistical method by the information it uses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta points me to  “EigenBracket 2012: Using Graph Theory to Predict NCAA March Madness Basketball”  and writes, “I [Folta] have got to believe that he’s simply re-invented a statistical method in a graph-ish context, but don’t know enough to judge.”
 
I have not looked in detail at the method being presented here—I’m not much of college basketball fan—but I’d like to use this as an excuse to make one of my favorite general point, which is that a good way to characterize any statistical method is by what information it uses. 
   
The basketball ranking method here uses score differentials between teams in the past season.  On the plus side, that is better than simply using one-loss records (which (a) discards score differentials and (b) discards information on who played whom).  On the minus side, the method appears to be discretizing the scores (thus throwing away information on the exact score differential) and doesn’t use any external information such as external ratings.

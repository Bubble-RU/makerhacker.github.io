<p>Introduction: Vishnu Ganglani writes:
  
It appears that multiple imputation appears to be the best way to impute missing data because of the more accurate quantification of variance. However, when imputing missing data for income values in national household surveys, would you recommend it would be practical to maintain the multiple datasets associated with multiple imputations, or a single imputation method would suffice. I have worked on household survey projects (in Scotland) and in the past gone with suggesting single methods for ease of implementation, but with the availability of open source R software I am think of performing multiple imputation methodologies, but a bit apprehensive because of the complexity and also the need to maintain multiple datasets (ease of implementation).
  
My reply:  In many applications I’ve just used a single random imputation to avoid the awkwardness of working with multiple datasets.  But if there’s any concern, I’d recommend doing parallel analyses on multipl</p><p>5 0.21633133 <a title="1344-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-01-When_should_you_worry_about_imputed_data%3F.html">935 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-01-When should you worry about imputed data?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Majid Ezzati writes:
  
My research group is increasingly focusing on a series of problems that involve data that either have missingness or measurements that may have bias/error.  We have at times developed our own approaches to imputation (as simple as interpolating a missing unit and as sophisticated as a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model) and at other times, other groups impute the data. 


The outputs are being used to investigate the basic associations between pairs of variables, Xs and Ys, in regressions; we may or may not interpret these as causal.  I am contacting colleagues with relevant expertise to suggest good references on whether having imputed X and/or Y in a subsequent regression is correct or if it could somehow lead to biased/spurious associations.   Thinking about this, we can have at least the following situations (these could all be Bayesian or not):

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights. I would only add one thing to his formula at the end of his</p><p>6 0.64499575 <a title="1344-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-30-Sorry%2C_Senator_DeMint%3A_Most_Americans_Don%E2%80%99t_Want_to_Ban_Gays_from_the_Classroom.html">381 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-30-Sorry, Senator DeMint: Most Americans Don’t Want to Ban Gays from the Classroom</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well. Come up with a scheme for inverse-probability weights (ignoring nonresponse and assuming there is exactly one phone line per household).

14. A public health survey of elderly Americans includes many questions, including “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” and also several questions about current mobility and health status. Response rates are high for the questions about recent activities and status, but there is a lot of nonresponse for the question on past activity.

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW. Wondering how many interviews they discarded to get down to 601 completes? Because @ppppolls discards a LOT of interviews.

My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.

<p>Introduction: 16. You are doing a survey in a war-torn country to estimate what percentage of unemployed men support the rebels in a civil war. Express this as a ratio estimation problem, where goal is to estimate Y.bar/X.bar.  What are x and y here? Give the estimate and standard error for the percentage of unemployed men who support the rebels.

<p>Introduction: Amanda Martinez, a writer for The Atlantic and others, advised attendees that her favorite writing “accorded me the basic human dignity of allowing me to draw my own conclusions.”
  
I really like that way of putting it, and this is something we tried hard to do with Red State Blue State, to put the information and our reasoning right there in front of the reader, rather than hiding behind a bunch of statistically-significant regression coefficients.
 
This is related to the idea of presenting research findings quantitatively (which, I think, lends itself to clearer statements of uncertainty and variation) rather than qualitatively (which seems to come out more deterministically, as “X causes Y” or “when A happens, B happens”).

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>3 0.29557598 <a title="1574-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-05-Let%E2%80%99s_try_this%3A__Instead_of_saying%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_probability_is_75%25%2C%E2%80%9D_say_%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_a_25%25_chance_I%E2%80%99m_wrong%E2%80%9D.html">1562 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-05-Let’s try this:  Instead of saying, “The probability is 75%,” say “There’s a 25% chance I’m wrong”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently  wrote  about the difficulty people have with probabilities, in this case the probability that Obama wins the election. If the probability is reported as 70%, people think Obama is going to win.  Actually, though, it just means that Obama is predicted to get about 50.8% of the two-party vote, with an uncertainty of something like 2 percentage points.  So, as I wrote, the election really is too close to call in the sense that the predicted vote margin is less than its uncertainty.
 
But . . . when people see a number such as 70%, they tend to attribute too much certainty to it.  Especially when the estimated probability has increased from, say 60%.  How to get the point across?  Commenter HS  had  what seems like a good suggestion:
  
Say that Obama will win, but there is 25% chance (or whatever) that this prediction is wrong? Same point, just slightly different framing, but somehow, this seems far less incendiary.
  
I like that.  Somehow a stated probability of 75% sounds a</p><p>4 0.26473993 <a title="1574-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>5 0.26394701 <a title="1574-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.

Gingrich is a wild card. He probably would end up a flaming wreckage in electoral terms, but there’s a chance he could become seen as the man unafraid to bring sweeping change to an ossified Washington, D.C. There’s perhaps a 90 percent likelihood Obama would wipe the floor with Gingrich, versus a 10 percent likelihood Gingrich would stage an historic upset.
  
This is the dumbest thing I’ve seen since . . . ummm, I dunno, how bout  this ?  It actually gets worse because Easterbrook then invokes game theory.  What next?  Catastrophe theory?  Intelligent design?
 
P.S.  Maybe I should explain for readers without an education in probability theory.  Let’s suppose “wipe the floor” means that Obama gets 55%+ of the two-party vote, and let’s suppose that “an historic upset” means that Obama gets less than 50% of the vote.  Now try to draw a forecast distribution that has 90% of its probability above 0.55 and 10% of it’s probability below 0.50.  It’s a pretty weird-loo</p><p>5 0.83430868 <a title="1574-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-Obama_and_Reagan%2C_sitting_in_a_tree%2C_etc..html">551 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-Obama and Reagan, sitting in a tree, etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>6 0.80951899 <a title="1574-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-05-Let%E2%80%99s_try_this%3A__Instead_of_saying%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_probability_is_75%25%2C%E2%80%9D_say_%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_a_25%25_chance_I%E2%80%99m_wrong%E2%80%9D.html">1562 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-05-Let’s try this:  Instead of saying, “The probability is 75%,” say “There’s a 25% chance I’m wrong”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had. There’s a  nice sor</p><p>2 0.92775238 <a title="1574-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-03-The_Employment_Nondiscrimination_Act_is_overwhelmingly_popular_in_nearly_every_one_of_the_50_states.html">2087 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-03-The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is overwhelmingly popular in nearly every one of the 50 states</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above graph shows the estimated support, by state, for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a gay rights bill that the Senate will be voting on this Monday.  The estimates were constructed by Kate Krimmel, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips using multilevel regression and poststratification.
 
Check out that graph again.  The scale goes from 20% to 80%, but  every state  is in the yellow-to-red range.  Support for a law making it illegal to discriminate against gays has majority support in every state. And in most states the support is very strong.
 
And  here’s the research paper  by Krimmel, Lax, and Phillips, which begins:
  
Public majorities have supported several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress has responded slowly if at all. We address this puzzle through dyadic analysis of the opinion- vote relationship on 23 roll-call votes between 1993 and 2010, matching members of Congress to policy-specific opinion in their state or district.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>5 0.89789402 <a title="1574-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-13-Question_of_the_week%3A__Will_the_authors_of_a_controversial_new_study_apologize_to_busy_statistician_Don_Berry_for_wasting_his_time_reading_and_responding_to_their_flawed_article%3F.html">1263 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-13-Question of the week:  Will the authors of a controversial new study apologize to busy statistician Don Berry for wasting his time reading and responding to their flawed article?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Carroll  shoots down  a politically-loaded claim about cancer survival.  Lots of useful  background  from science reporter Sharon Begley:
  
With the United States spending more on healthcare than any other country — $2.5 trillion, or just over $8,000 per capita, in 2009 — the question has long been, is it worth it? At least for spending on cancer, a controversial new study answers with an emphatic “yes.” . . .


Experts shown an advance copy of the paper by Reuters argued that the tricky statistics of cancer outcomes tripped up the authors.


“This study is pure folly,” said biostatistician Dr. Don Berry of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “It’s completely misguided and it’s dangerous. Not only are the authors’ analyses flawed but their conclusions are also wrong.”
  
Ouch.  Arguably the study shouldn’t be getting any coverage at all, but given that it’s in the news, it’s good to see it get shot down.  I wonder if the  authors  will respond to Don Berry and say they’re sorr</p><p>6 0.88783264 <a title="1574-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-04-When_is_there_%E2%80%9Chidden_structure_in_data%E2%80%9D_to_be_discovered%3F.html">1788 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-04-When is there “hidden structure in data” to be discovered?</a></p>

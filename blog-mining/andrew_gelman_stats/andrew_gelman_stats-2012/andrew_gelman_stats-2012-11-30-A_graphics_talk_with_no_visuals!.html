<p>Introduction: It  went pretty well, especially considering it was an  entirely new talk  (even though, paradoxically, all the images were old), and even though I had a tough act to follow:  I came on immediately after an excellent short presentation by Jed Dougherty on some cool information and visualization software that he and his colleagues are building for social workers.
 
The only problems with my were:
 
(a) I planned to elicit more audience involvement but didn’t do it. It would’ve been easy:  at any point I could’ve just paused and had the audience members work in pairs to come up with suggested improvements to any of my graphs.  But I forgot to do it.
 
(b) I went on too long.  The talk was going so well, I didn’t stop.  In retrospect, it would’ve been better to stop earlier.  Better for people to leave the table hungry than stuffed.
 
Also, next time I’ll drop the bit about the nuns-in-prison movies.

<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.
 
It would take very little effort to adapt this graph-laden a</p><p>4 0.87725633 <a title="1598-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-What_goes_around_._._..html">548 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-What goes around . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>2 0.99444503 <a title="1598-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-16-Visualizations_of_NYPD_stop-and-frisk_data.html">1014 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-16-Visualizations of NYPD stop-and-frisk data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cathy O’Neil  organized  this visualization project  with NYPD stop-and-frisk data.  It’s part of the Data Without Borders project.  Unfortunately, because of legal restrictions I couldn’t send them the data Jeff, Alex, and I used in  our project  several years ago.</p><p>3 0.99194723 <a title="1598-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Where_are_the_larger-than-life_athletes%3F.html">1115 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Where are the larger-than-life athletes?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  a  blog  by Samuel Arbesman mocking people who are so lazy that they take the elevator from 1 to 2.  This reminds me of my own annoyance about a guy who worked in my building and did  not  take the elevator.  (For the full story, go  here  and search on “elevator.”)</p><p>5 0.97995311 <a title="1598-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-07-Some_silly_things_you_%28didn%E2%80%99t%29_miss_by_not_reading_the_sister_blog.html">1659 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-07-Some silly things you (didn’t) miss by not reading the sister blog</a></p>

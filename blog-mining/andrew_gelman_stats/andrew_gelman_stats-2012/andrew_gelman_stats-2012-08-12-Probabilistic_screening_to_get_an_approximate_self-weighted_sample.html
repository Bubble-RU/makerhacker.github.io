</p><p>6 You call it rejection sampling, in the survey sampling world it is called two-phase sampling. [sent-12, score-0.548]
</p><p>7 The alternative is to survey who you can get and then adjust via weighting or post stratification to match sample to population according to known characteristics. [sent-13, score-0.754]
</p><p>8 Either approach is ok, the key concerns are cost and convenience. [sent-14, score-0.211]
</p><p>9 Your approach requires more effort in the data collection stage but less effort in the analysis stage and thus is particularly appropriate to surveys where you’re planning to release the data for others to analyze. [sent-15, score-0.902]
</p><p>10 There is also a cost issue because you went to the effort to get various participants and then screened them away–but this is less of an effort for a survey such as yours with volunteers. [sent-16, score-0.976]
</p><p>11 Still, once you’ve done this, I think you’ll want to adjust for other variables in addition to age and sex. [sent-18, score-0.334]
</p><p>12 You could screen on these variables too, or you could just gather this information in the second phase and then post stratify on them. [sent-20, score-0.284]
</p><p>13 But if you’re doing the screening anyway, I recommend you screen on more variables. [sent-21, score-0.562]
</p><p>14 In any case, you’re already ahead of the game in that most experimental data are unadjusted to match for the population. [sent-23, score-0.224]

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

I’m fitting a state-space model right now that estimates the “design effect” of individual pollsters (Ratio of poll variance to that predicted by perfect random sampling). What would be a good prior distribution for that?
  
My quickest suggestion is start with something simple, such as a uniform from 1 to 10, and then to move to something hierarchical, such as a lognormal on (design.effect – 1), with the hyperparameters estimated from data.
 
My longer suggestion is to take things apart.  What exactly do you mean by “design effect”?  There are lots of things going on, both in sampling error (the classical “design effect” that comes from cluster sampling, stratification, weighting, etc.) and nonsampling error (nonresponse bias, likeliy voter screening, bad questions, etc.)  It would be best if you could model both pieces.</p><p>5 0.18056601 <a title="1455-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-26-Some_thoughts_on_survey_weighting.html">1430 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-26-Some thoughts on survey weighting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From a comment I made in an email exchange:
 
My  work  on survey adjustments has very much been inspired by the ideas of Rod Little.  Much of my efforts have gone toward the goal of integrating hierarchical modeling (which is so helpful for small-area estimation) with post stratification (which adjusts for known differences between sample and population).  In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.

You can find a full smackdown courtesy of UK-based sex educator and University College London psychologist Petra Boynton  here .
      
(One does wonder how a parenting club with such close links to the UK National Health Service thought a survey on this topic was at all appropriate, but that’s another rant.)


So far, so awful, but what I [Wolters] thought might grab your attention was the excuse OnePoll offered for their work in their email to Petra.

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).

In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.
 
As I wrote in the first sentence of the above-linked paper, I do think the current theory and practice of survey weighting is a mess, in that much depends on so</p><p>5 0.85434383 <a title="1455-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-16-A_poll_that_throws_away_data%3F%3F%3F.html">1940 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-16-A poll that throws away data???</a></p>

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW.

<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak points me to  this article  by the always-excellent Carl Bialik, slamming hypothesis tests.  I only wish Carl had talked with me before so hastily posting, though!  I would’ve argued with some of the things in the article.  In particular, he writes:
  
Reese and Brad Carlin . . . suggest that Bayesian statistics are a better alternative, because they tackle the probability that the hypothesis is true head-on, and incorporate prior knowledge about the variables involved.
  
Brad Carlin does great work in theory, methods, and applications, and I like the bit about the prior knowledge (although I might prefer the more general phrase “additional information”), but I hate that quote!  
 
My quick response is that the hypothesis of zero effect is almost never true!  The problem with the significance testing framework–Bayesian or otherwise–is in the obsession with the possibility of an exact zero effect.  The real concern is not with zero, it’s with claiming a positive effect whe</p><p>3 0.9895559 <a title="1455-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-Comparing_prediction_errors.html">938 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-Comparing prediction errors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone named James writes: 
  
  
I’m working on a classification task, sentence segmentation.  The classifier algorithm we use (BoosTexter, a boosted learning algorithm) classifies each word independently conditional on its features, i.e. a bag-of-words model, so any contextual clues need to be encoded into the features.  The feature extraction system I am proposing in my thesis uses a heteroscedastic LDA to transform data to produce the features the classifier runs on. The HLDA system has a couple parameters I’m testing, and I’m running a 3×2 full factorial experiment. That’s the background which may or may not be relevant to the question.


The output of each trial is a class (there are only 2 classes, right now) for every word in the dataset.  Because of the nature of the task, one class strongly predominates, say 90-95% of the data.  My question is this: in terms of overall performance (we use F1 score), many of these trials are pretty close together, which leads me to ask whethe</p><p>4 0.98907721 <a title="1455-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-12-Fixing_the_race%2C_ethnicity%2C_and_national_origin_questions_on_the_U.S._Census.html">1978 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-12-Fixing the race, ethnicity, and national origin questions on the U.S. Census</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>5 0.98880476 <a title="1455-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-01-Mothers_and_Moms.html">1479 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-01-Mothers and Moms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philip Cohen  asks , “Why are mothers becoming moms?”  These aren’t just two words for the same thing:  in political terms “mother” is merely descriptive while “mom” is more positive.  Indeed, we speak of “mom and apple pie” as unquestionable American icons.
 
Cohen points out that motherhood is sometimes but not always respected in political discourse:
  
On the one hand, both President Obama and pundit Hilary Rosen have now called motherhood the world’s hardest job. And with the Romneys flopping onto the all-mothers-work bandwagon, it appears we’re reaching a rare rhetorical consensus.


On the other hand, the majority in both major political parties agrees that poor single mothers and their children need one thing above all – a (real) job, one that provides the “dignity of an honest day’s work.” For welfare purposes, taking care of children is not only not the toughest job in the world, it is more akin to nothing at all.

Today during the group meeting at my new job we were revising a paper whose main conclusions were sustained by an ANOVA.


One of the first observations is that the experiment had a small sample size. Interestingly (may not so), some of the reported effects (most of them interactions) were quite large. One of the experience group members said that “there is a common wisdom that one should not believe effects from small sample sizes but [he thinks] if they [the effects] are large enough to be picked on a small study they must be real large effects”. I argued that if the sample size is small one could incur on a M-type error in which the magnitude of the effect is being over-estimated and that if larger samples are evaluated the magnitude may become smaller and also the confidence intervals. The concept of M-type error is completely new to all other members of the group (on which I am in my second week) and I was given the job of finding a suitable ref to explain</p><p>3 0.12889259 <a title="1615-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Continuous_variables_in_Bayesian_networks.html">1228 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Continuous variables in Bayesian networks</a></p>

I’m a former undergrad machine learning student and a current software engineer with a Bayesian hobby. Today my two worlds collided. I ask for some enlightenment.


On your blog you’ve repeatedly advocated continuous distributions with Bayesian models. Today I read  this article  by Ricky Ho, who writes:

 
The strength of Bayesian network is it is highly scalable and can learn incrementally because all we do is to count the observed variables and update the probability distribution table. Similar to Neural Network, Bayesian network expects all data to be binary, categorical variable will need to be transformed into multiple binary variable as described above. Numeric variable is generally not a good fit for Bayesian network.
 

The last sentence seems to be at odds with what you’ve said. Sadly, I don’t have enough expertise to say which view of the world is correct.

<p>Introduction: Gerrit Storms reports on an interesting linguistic research project in which you can participate!  Here’s the description:
  
Over the past few weeks, we have been trying to set up a scientific study that is important for many researchers interested in words, word meaning, semantics, and cognitive science in general.  It is a huge word association project, in which people are asked to participate in a small task that doesn’t last longer than 5 minutes. Our goal is to build a global word association network that contains connections between about 40,000 words, the size of the lexicon of an average adult. Setting up such a network might learn us a lot about semantic memory, how it develops, and maybe also about how it can deteriorate (like in Alzheimer’s disease). Most people enjoy doing the task, but we need thousands of participants to succeed. Up till today, we found about 53,000 participants willing to do the little task, but we need more subjects. That is why we address you.

<p>Introduction: AT  discusses  [link broken; see P.P.S. below] a new paper of his that casts doubt on the robustness of the  controversial  Christakis and Fowler papers.  AT writes that he ran some simulations of contagion on social networks and found that (a) in a simple model assuming the contagion of the sort hypothesized by Christakis and Fowler, their procedure would indeed give the sorts of estimates they found in their papers, but (b) in another simple model assuming a different sort of contagion, the C&F; estimation would give indistinguishable estimates.  Thus, if you believe AT’s simulation model, C&F;’s procedure cannot statistically distinguish between two sorts of contagion (directional and simultaneous).
 
I have not looked at AT’s paper so I can’t fully comment, but I don’t fully understand his method for simulating network connections.  AT uses what he calls a “rewiring” model.

<p>Introduction: Freakonomics  reports :
  

A reader in Norway named Christian Sørensen examined the height statistics for all players in the 2010 World Cup and found an interesting anomaly: there seemed to be unnaturally few players listed at 169, 179, and 189 centimeters and an apparent surplus of players who were 170, 180, and 190 centimeters tall (roughly 5-foot-7 inches, 5-foot-11 inches, and 6-foot-3 inches, respectively). Here’s the data:

  
 
 
It’s not costless to communicate numbers. When we compare “eighty” (6 characters) vs “seventy-nine” (12 characters) – how much information are we gaining by twice the number of characters? Do people really care about height at +-0.5 cm or is +-1 cm enough?
 
It’s harder to communicate odd numbers (“three” vs four or two, “seven” vs “six” or “eight”, “nine” vs “ten”) than even ones. As language tends to follow our behaviors, people have been doing it for a long time. We remember the shorter description of a quantity.
 
This is my theory why we end up wi</p><p>3 0.70645612 <a title="1615-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-19-Everything_is_Obvious_%28once_you_know_the_answer%29.html">719 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-19-Everything is Obvious (once you know the answer)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.

<p>Introduction: God is in every leaf of every tree , but he is not in every leaf of every parable.
 
Let me explain with a story.  A few months ago I  read  the new book, Doing Data Science, by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neal, and I came across the following motivation for comprehensive integration of data sources, a story that is reminiscent of the parables we sometimes see in business books:
  
By some estimates, one or two patients died per week in a certain smallish town because of the lack of information flow between the hospital’s emergency room and the nearby mental health clinic. In other words, if the records had been easier to match, they’d have been able to save more lives. On the other hand, if it had been easy to match records, other breaches of confidence might also have occurred. Of course it’s hard to know exactly how many lives are at stake, but it’s nontrivial.
  
The moral:
  
We can assume we think privacy is a generally good thing. . . . But privacy takes lives too, as we see from</p><p>5 0.70350277 <a title="1615-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-21-Defensive_political_science_responds_defensively_to_an_attack_on_social_science.html">1949 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-21-Defensive political science responds defensively to an attack on social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis, a medical scientist perhaps best known for his  controversial  claim (see also  here ), based on joint work with James Fowler, that obesity is contagious,  writes : 
  
  
The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .


I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics.

<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.
 
Now consider how</p><p>3 0.95346057 <a title="1615-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-21-On_deck_this_week.html">2298 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-21-On deck this week</a></p>

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.  In political science, the usual way to start is</p><p>5 0.93931174 <a title="1615-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-30-David_Hogg_on_statistics.html">1401 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-30-David Hogg on statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data :
  
We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation</p><p>6 0.93656546 <a title="1615-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-Neumann_update.html">432 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-Neumann update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a review of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” William Saletan  writes :
  
You’re smart. You’re liberal. You’re well informed. You think conservatives are narrow-minded. You can’t understand why working-class Americans vote Republican. You figure they’re being duped. You’re wrong. . . .


Haidt diverges from other psychologists who have analyzed the left’s electoral failures. The usual argument of these psycho-­pundits is that conservative politicians manipulate voters’ neural roots — playing on our craving for authority, for example — to trick people into voting against their interests. But Haidt treats electoral success as a kind of evolutionary fitness test. He figures that if voters like Republican messages, there’s something in Republican messages worth liking. He chides psychologists who try to “explain away” conservatism, treating it as a pathology. Conservatism thrives because it fits how people think, and that’s what validates it.

<p>Introduction: Here’s some psychology research that’s relevant to  yesterday’s discussion  on working-class voting.  In  a paper  to appear in the journal  Cognitive Science , Andrei Cimpian, Amanda Brandone, and Susan Gelman write:
  
Generic statements (e.g., “Birds lay eggs”) express generalizations about categories. In this paper, we hypothesized that there is a paradoxical asymmetry at the core of generic meaning, such that these sentences have extremely strong implications but require little evidence to be judged true. Four experiments confirmed the hypothesized asymmetry: Participants interpreted novel generics such as “Lorches have purple feathers” as referring to nearly all lorches, but they judged the same novel generics to be true given a wide range of prevalence levels (e.g., even when only 10% or 30% of lorches had purple feathers). A second hypothesis, also confirmed by the results, was that novel generic sentences about dangerous or distinctive properties would be more acceptable than</p><p>4 0.38984522 <a title="1372-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling_different_claims_about_working-class_voters.html">1385 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling different claims about working-class voters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>5 0.33488214 <a title="1372-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-29-Jost_Haidt.html">1515 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-29-Jost Haidt</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Research psychologist John Jost  reviews  the recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” by research psychologist Jonathan Haidt.  Some of my thoughts on Haidt’s book are  here .  And here’s some of Jost’s review:
  
Haidt’s book is creative, interesting, and provocative. . . . The book shines a new light on moral psychology and presents a bold, confrontational message. From a scientific perspective, however, I worry that his theory raises more questions than it answers. Why do some individuals feel that it is morally good (or necessary) to obey authority, favor the ingroup, and maintain purity, whereas others are skeptical? (Perhaps parenting style is relevant after all.) Why do some people think that it is morally acceptable to judge or even mistreat others such as gay or lesbian couples or, only a generation ago, interracial couples because they dislike or feel disgusted by them, whereas others do not? Why does the present generation “care about violence toward many more classes of victims</p><p>6 0.27314919 <a title="1372-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

Four experiments confirmed the hypothesized asymmetry: Participants interpreted novel generics such as “Lorches have purple feathers” as referring to nearly all lorches, but they judged the same novel generics to be true given a wide range of prevalence levels (e.g., even when only 10% or 30% of lorches had purple feathers). A second hypothesis, also confirmed by the results, was that novel generic sentences about dangerous or distinctive properties would be more acceptable than</p><p>4 0.91314 <a title="1372-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Same_old_story.html">1229 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Same old story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a review of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” William Saletan  writes :
  
You’re smart. You’re liberal. You’re well informed. You think conservatives are narrow-minded. You can’t understand why working-class Americans vote Republican. You figure they’re being duped. You’re wrong. . . .


Haidt diverges from other psychologists who have analyzed the left’s electoral failures. The usual argument of these psycho-­pundits is that conservative politicians manipulate voters’ neural roots — playing on our craving for authority, for example — to trick people into voting against their interests. But Haidt treats electoral success as a kind of evolutionary fitness test. He figures that if voters like Republican messages, there’s something in Republican messages worth liking. He chides psychologists who try to “explain away” conservatism, treating it as a pathology. Conservatism thrives because it fits how people think, and that’s what validates it.

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design. The paper also presents some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories. This evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or</p><p>2 0.9723767 <a title="1372-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-31-Statistical_modeling%2C_causal_inference%2C_and_social_science.html">1645 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-31-Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  discussion  by Berk Ozler (which I found following  links  from Tyler Cowen) of a study by Erwin Bulte, Lei Pan, Joseph Hella, Gonne Beekman, and Salvatore di Falco that compares two agricultural experiments, one blinded and one unblinded.  Bulte et al. find much different results in the two experiments and attribute the difference to expectation effects (when people know they’re receiving an experiment they behave differently); Ozler is skeptical and attributes the different outcomes to various practical differences in implementation of the two experiments.
 
I’m reminded somehow of the  notorious  sham experiment on the dead chickens, a story that was good for endless discussion in my Bayesian statistics class last semester.  I think we can all agree that dead chickens won’t exhibit a placebo effect.  Live farmers, though, that’s another story.
 
I don’t have any stake in this particular fight, but on quick reading I’m sympathetic to Ozler’s argument that this all is wel</p><p>3 0.9710533 <a title="1372-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-27-Why_aren%E2%80%99t_Asians_Republicans%3F__For_one_thing%2C_more_than_half_of_them_live_in_California%2C_New_York%2C_New_Jersey%2C_and_Hawaii.html">1593 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-27-Why aren’t Asians Republicans?

<p>Introduction: Stephen Olivier points me to this horrible, horrible  news article  by Jonathan Haidt, “Why working-class people vote conservative”:
  
Across the world, blue-collar voters ally themselves with the political right . . . Why on Earth would a working-class person ever vote for a conservative candidate? This question has obsessed the American left since Ronald Reagan first captured the votes of so many union members, farmers, urban Catholics and other relatively powerless people – the so-called “Reagan Democrats”. . . .
  
Sorry, but no no no no no.  Where to start?
 
Here’s the difference between upper-income and lower-income votes in presidential elections:
 
   
 
Ronald Reagan did about 20 percentage points better among voters in the upper third of income, compared to voters in the lower third.  The relation between income and voting since 1980 is about the same as it was in the 1940s.
 
Oh yeah, Haidt said something about “across the world.”  How bout this:
 
   
 
It varies.  In mos</p><p>5 0.95960307 <a title="1372-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-22-Likelihood_Ratio_%E2%89%A0_1_Journal.html">1774 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-22-Likelihood Ratio ≠ 1 Journal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan  writes :
  
The basic idea . . . is to promote identification of study designs that scholars who disagree about a proposition would agree would generate evidence relevant to their competing conjectures—regardless of what studies based on such designs actually find. Articles proposing designs of this sort would be selected for publication and only then be carried out, by the proposing researchers with funding from the journal, which would publish the results too.


Now I [Kahan] am aware of a set of real journals that have a similar motivation.


One is the  Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, which as its title implies publishes papers reporting studies that fail to “reject” the null. Like JASNH, LR ≠1J would try to offset the “file drawer” bias and like bad consequences associated with the convention of publishing only findings that are “significant at p < 0.05."


But it would try to do more.

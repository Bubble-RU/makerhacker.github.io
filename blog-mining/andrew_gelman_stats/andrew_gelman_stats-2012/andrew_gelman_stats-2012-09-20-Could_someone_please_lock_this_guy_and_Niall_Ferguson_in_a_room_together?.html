<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.13898575 <a title="1504-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-10-What_happens_when_the_Democrats_are_%E2%80%9Cfighting_Wall_Street_with_one_hand%2C_unions_with_the_other%2C%E2%80%9D_while_the_Republicans_are_fighting_unions_with_two_hands%3F.html">79 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-10-What happens when the Democrats are “fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other,” while the Republicans are fighting unions with two hands?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>4 0.13630472 <a title="1504-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling_different_claims_about_working-class_voters.html">1385 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling different claims about working-class voters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>5 0.13181168 <a title="1504-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-22-More_Pinker_Pinker_Pinker.html">1635 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-22-More Pinker Pinker Pinker</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I posted  this  recent comment on a blog of Steven Pinker (see also  here ), we had the following exchange.  I’m reposting it here (with Pinker’s agreement) not because we achieved any deep insights but because I thought it useful to reveal to people that so-called experts such as us are not so clear on these issues either. 
   
 AG:   I noticed your article on red and blue states and had some thoughts. . . . The short summary is that I think that your idea is interesting but that, as stated, it explains too much, in that your story is based on centuries-long history but it only fits electoral patterns since the 1980s.
 
 SP:   Though the exact alignment between red and blue states, political parties, and particular issues surely shift, I’d be surprised if the basic alignments between geography and the right-left divide, and the issues that cluster on each side of the divide, have radically changed over the past century.

<p>Introduction: So  asks  James Ledbetter in Slate.
 
And  the answer is  . . . No!
 
Here’s what happened in 2008:
 
 
 
OK, that’s how people vote.  How bout party identification and ideology?   Check these out :
 
   
(Click on image to see larger version.) 
 
And here it is,  sliced a different way :
 
   
 
Of, if you want to see it in map form, check out  this article  (with Daniel and Yair).
 
P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>5 0.8328467 <a title="1504-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-A_redrawing_of_the_Red-Blue_map_in_November_2010%3F.html">362 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-A redrawing of the Red-Blue map in November 2010?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states. In light of this correlation, would you say that there currently is</p><p>6 0.8288914 <a title="1504-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-The_Conservative_States_of_America.html">636 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-The Conservative States of America</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>2 0.94236153 <a title="1504-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-06-Statistical_inference_and_the_secret_ballot.html">1407 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-06-Statistical inference and the secret ballot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ring Lardner, Jr.:
  
[In 1936] I was already settled in Southern California, and it may have been that first exercise of the franchise that triggered the FBI surveillance of me that would last for decades.  I had assumed, of course, that I was enjoying the vaunted American privilege of the secret ballot.  On a wall outside my polling place on Wilshire Boulevard, however, was a compilation of the district’s registered voters:  Democrats, a long list of names; Republicans, a somewhat lesser number; and “Declines to State,” one, “Ring W. Lardner, Jr.”  The day after the election, alongside those lists were published the results:  Roosevelt, so many; Landon, so many; Browder, one.</p><p>3 0.93478733 <a title="1504-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-09-I_was_at_a_meeting_a_couple_months_ago_._._..html">999 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-09-I was at a meeting a couple months ago . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>5 0.91394794 <a title="1504-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-27-Richard_Stallman_and_John_McCarthy.html">1031 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-27-Richard Stallman and John McCarthy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After blogging on quirky software pioneer  Richard Stallman , I thought it appropriate to write something about recently deceased quirky software pioneer John McCarthy, who, with the exception of being bearded, seems like he was the personal and political opposite of Stallman.
 
 Here’s  a page I found of  Stallman  McCarthy quotes (compiled by Neil Craig).  It’s a mixture of the reasonable and the unreasonable (ok, I suppose the same could be said of this blog!).
 
I wonder if he and Stallman ever met and, if so, whether they had an extended conversation.  It would be like matter and anti-matter! 
   
P.S.  I flipped through McCarthy’s pages and found one of my pet peeves.  See item 3  here , which sounds so plausible but is in fact  not true  (at least, not according to the National Election Study).  As McCarthy’s Stanford colleague Mo Fiorina can tell you, otherwise well-informed people believe all sorts of things about polarization that aren’t so.

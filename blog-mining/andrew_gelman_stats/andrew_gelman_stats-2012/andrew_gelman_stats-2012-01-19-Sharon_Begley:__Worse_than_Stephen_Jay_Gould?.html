[sent-1, score-0.263]
</p><p>2 Here’s the background: Men are more jealous than women about sexual infidelity, and women are more jealous than men about emotional infidelity. [sent-7, score-1.142]
</p><p>3 The idea is that men fear cuckoldry–they don’t want to get stuck raising other men’s genetic offspring—so it’s a big deal if their woman sleeps around. [sent-9, score-0.236]
</p><p>4 The new  paper  [by Kenneth Levy and Kristen Kelly] reports a factor that explains some of the sex differences in jealousy: attachment style. [sent-14, score-0.535]
</p><p>5 People who are dismissive of relationships are more threatened by sexual infidelity than other people are (sex matters more to them than intimacy), and on average men are more dismissive of relationships than women. [sent-15, score-1.554]
</p><p>6 Because early childhood experiences often influence attachment style, Begley writes: “Conclusion: Mars-Venus differences in jealousy are the result of attachment style and not of our caveman genes. [sent-16, score-1.311]
</p><p>7 ’”  Begley continues:    An intriguing new study suggests that the gender gap in jealousy may be the result of something that is not at all hard-wired: the different ways boys and girls are raised. [sent-19, score-0.471]
</p><p>8 people whose parents were warm and loving and reliable sources of emotional support tend to be “securely” attached, forming successful adult relationships that are not marred by excessive clinginess or jealousy. [sent-27, score-0.578]
</p><p>9 But people whose parents were distant or cold tend to be “avoidant”: they are either dismissive of close relationships (and therefore prefer autonomy to commitment, and are often promiscuous) or afraid of them. [sent-28, score-0.455]
</p><p>10 [Levy and Kelly] hypothesized that people who are dismissive of relationships would be more distressed by sexual than emotional infidelity. [sent-32, score-0.994]
</p><p>11 That held for men as well as women—no sex difference. [sent-37, score-0.341]
</p><p>12 They also found that men and women who are fearful of relationships are more upset by emotional infidelity; again, no sex difference. [sent-38, score-0.946]
</p><p>13 Only men and women who are dismissive of relationships, the scientists found, are more upset by sexual straying than by a mate’s finding his or her soul mate in someone else. [sent-39, score-0.889]
</p><p>14 Because “more men than women are dismissive of relationships, and because such people are concerned more about sexual infidelity,” they write, “what looks like a gender difference is in fact an attachment effect”—that is, a product of how people feel about forming close relationships. [sent-40, score-1.216]
</p><p>15 Conclusion: Mars-Venus differences in jealousy are the result of attachment style and not of our caveman genes. [sent-41, score-1.003]
</p><p>16 That captures the general impression of what Levy and Kelly wrote:    We hypothesized that attachment‐style differences may help to explain both between‐ and within‐sex differences in jealousy. [sent-42, score-0.32]
</p><p>17 As hypothesized, dismissing avoidant participants reported more jealousy regarding sexual than emotional infidelity . [sent-43, score-1.231]
</p><p>18 and secure participants, including secure men, reported more jealousy regarding emotional than sexual infidelity . [sent-46, score-1.226]
</p><p>19 Although between‐sex differences in jealousy clearly exist, the within‐sex differences suggest the existence of additional processes beyond those proposed by the parental‐investment model. [sent-49, score-0.559]
</p><p>20 Sometimes you think rappers might be rapping about something other than rapping . [sent-65, score-0.363]

The original report is quite clear about weighting things, smaple sizes, etc.  The apparent “clincher” argument in the editorial—that over 50% of unwanted sexual advances in the military are experienced by men—seems to confound several things.  The first being, of course, that with only 14% of service members being female, it is quite likely by their broad definition that the 86% of service members who are men actually *do* comprise the majority of unwanted sexual attention even if the incidence is only a fraction of that of female service members.

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.

<p>Introduction: Sharon Jayson  writes :
  
The conventional wisdom that’s developed over the past few decades — based on early research — has said parents are less happy, more depressed and have less-satisfying marriages than their childless counterparts.


But now, two new studies presented as part of the Population Association of America’s annual meeting suggest that earlier findings in several studies weren’t so clear-cut and may, in fact, be flawed. The newer analyses presented this week use analytical methods based on data from almost 130,000 adults around the globe — including more than 52,000 parents — and the conclusions aren’t so grim. They say that parents today may indeed be happier than non-parents and that parental happiness levels — while they do drop — don’t dip below the levels they were before having children. . . .


The other study, of some 120,000 adults from two nationally representative surveys between 1972-2008, finds that parents were indeed less happy than non-parents in the d</p><p>4 0.77336252 <a title="1128-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-24-Differences_in_color_perception_by_sex%2C_also_the_Bechdel_test_for_women_in_movies.html">161 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-24-Differences in color perception by sex, also the Bechdel test for women in movies</a></p>

The authors of the study, Lee Ellis and Christopher Ficek, wrote:
  
We are inclined to suspect the involvement of neurohormonal factors. Studies of rats have found average sex differences in the number of neurons comprising various parts of the visual cortex. Also, gender differences have been found in rat preferences for the amount of sweetness in drinking water. One experiment demonstrated that the sex differences in rat preferences for sweetness was eliminated by depriving males of male-typical testosterone levels in utero. Perhaps, prenatal exposure to testosterone and other sex hormones operates in a similar way to “bias” preferences for certain colors in humans.
  
As Wade points out, that all seems a bit ridiculous giv</p><p>5 0.77297908 <a title="1128-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-27-Thin_scientists_say_it%E2%80%99s_unhealthy_to_be_fat.html">1741 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-27-Thin scientists say it’s unhealthy to be fat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>6 0.76162946 <a title="1128-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-11-This_one_is_so_dumb_it_makes_me_want_to_barf.html">1053 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-11-This one is so dumb it makes me want to barf</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points us to  this  feel-good story of the day:
  
A Samurai sword-wielding Mormon bishop helped a neighbor woman escape a Tuesday morning attack by a man who had been stalking her.


Kent Hendrix woke up Tuesday to his teenage son pounding on his bedroom door and telling him somebody was being mugged in front of their house. The 47-year-old father of six rushed out the door and grabbed the weapon closest to him — a 29-inch high carbon steel Samurai sword. . . .


Hendrix, a pharmaceutical statistician, was one of several neighbors who came to the woman’s aid after she began yelling for help . . .
  
Too bad the whole “statistician” thing got buried in the middle of the article.  Fair enough, though:  I don’t know what it takes to become a Mormon bishop, but I assume it’s more effort than what it takes to learn statistics.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86719751 <a title="1128-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-19-Sharon_Begley%3A__Worse_than_Stephen_Jay_Gould%3F.html">1128 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-19-Sharon Begley:  Worse than Stephen Jay Gould?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Tggp  links  to a criticism of science journalist Sharon Begley by science journalist Matthew Hutson.  I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”
 
Hutson  writes :

<p>Introduction: Jim Hodges posted a note to the Bugs mailing list that I thought could be of more general interest: 
  
  
Is multi-modality a common experience?  I [Hodges] think the answer is “nobody knows in any generality”.  Here are some examples of bimodality that certainly do *not* involve the kind of labeling problems that arise in mixture models.


The only systematic study of multimodality I know of is 


Liu J, Hodges JS (2003).  Posterior bimodality in the balanced one-way random effects model.  J.~Royal Stat.~Soc., Ser.~B, 65:247-255.


The surprise of this paper is that in the simplest possible hierarchical model (analyzed using the standard inverse-gamma priors for the two variances), bimodality occurs quite readily, although it is much less common to have two modes that are big enough so that you’d actually get a noticeable fraction of MCMC draws from both of them.  Because the restricted likelihood (= the marginal posterior for the two variances, if you’ve put flat priors on them) is</p><p>4 0.83950496 <a title="1128-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-13-Economists_._._..html">1378 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-13-Economists . . .</a></p>

On Monday the Nobel Foundation, which bestows the world’s most prestigious academic, literary and humanitarian prizes, said it was reducing the cash awarded with Nobel Prizes by about 20 percent. . . .


Peter A. Diamond, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also received the Nobel in economic science in 2010, observed that over the long run, cutting the cash award could dilute the prize’s prestige.


But he added that Monday’s news overstates the financial blow to future laureates. “One of the things that comes with the prize, besides the prestige and the money,” he said, “is the opportunities to make more money.”
  
I wouldn’t think these guys need the money, but I suppose it’s part of their professional code that they have to say that?  (Recall our earlier  discussion  of the economist who said he’d stop working once his marginal tax rate reached the anticipated value of 93%.)</p><p>5 0.8239367 <a title="1128-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-What_are_the_trickiest_models_to_fit%3F.html">575 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-What are the trickiest models to fit?</a></p>

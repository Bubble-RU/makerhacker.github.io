<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.

<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>6 0.088966653 <a title="1519-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Data_mining_efforts_for_Obama%E2%80%99s_campaign.html">951 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Data mining efforts for Obama’s campaign</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

We are looking to hire full time analysts at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The work involves extensive econometric analysis and handling of large databases. The analysts will be part of a team working to address various empirical microeconomic issues.

<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

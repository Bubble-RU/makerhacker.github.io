<p>Introduction: The official announcement:
  
The Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award for 2010 is presented to Felix Salmon for his body of work, which exemplifies the highest standards of scientific reporting. His insightful use of statistics as a tool to understanding the world of business and economics, areas that are critical in today’s economy, sets a new standard in statistical investigative reporting.
  
Here are some examples:
 
 Tiger Woods 
 
 Nigerian spammers 
 
 How the government fudges job statistics 
 
This one is important to me.  The idea is that “statistical reporting” is not just traditional science reporting (journalist talks with scientists and tries to understand the consensus) or science popularization or silly feature stories about the lottery.  Salmon is doing investigative reporting using statistical thinking.
 
Also, from a political angle, Salmon’s smart and quantitatively sophisticated work (as well as that of others such as Nate Silver) is an important counterweigh</p><p>3 0.14312242 <a title="1119-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-27-Should_statistics_have_a_Nobel_prize%3F.html">2151 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-27-Should statistics have a Nobel prize?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>4 0.10187189 <a title="1119-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-09-Statistics_gifts%3F.html">460 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-09-Statistics gifts?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Due to my similar interest in  plagiarism , I went to The Human Cultural and Social Landscape session. [The recipient of the American Statistical Association's Founders Award in 2002] gave the first talk in the session instead of Yasmin Said, which was modestly attended (20 or so people) and gave a sociology talk with no numbers — and no attribution to where these ideas (on Afghanistan culture) came from. Would it really have hurt to give the source of this? I’m on board with plain laziness for this one.


I think he may have mentioned a number of his collaborators at the beginning, and all he talked about were cultural customs and backgrounds, no science to speak of.
  
It’s kind of amazing to me that he actually showed up at JSM, but of course if he had any shame, he wouldn’t have repeatedly  stolen  copied without proper attribution in the first place.  It’s not even like Doris Kearns Goodwin who reportedly produced a well-written book out of it!</p><p>6 0.099246129 <a title="1119-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-04-Honored_oldsters_write_about_statistics.html">2317 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-04-Honored oldsters write about statistics</a></p>

TEMPLETON BOOK FORUM invites you to “Is the Cyber Mob a Threat to Freedom?” featuring Ron Rosenbaum, Slate, Lee Siegel, The New York Observer, moderated by Michael Goodwin, The New York Post


New Threats to Freedom


Today’s threats to freedom are “much less visible and obvious than they were in the 20th century and may even appear in the guise of social and political progress,” writes Adam Bellow in his introduction to the new essay collection that he has edited for the Templeton Press. Indeed, Bellow suggests, the danger often lies precisely in our “failure or reluctance to notice them.”


According to Ron Rosenbaum and Lee Siegel, in their provocative contributions to the volume, the extraordinary advances made possible by the Internet have come at a sometimes worrisome cost. Rosenbaum focuses on how online anonymity has become a mask encouraging political discourse that is increasingly distorted by vitriol, abuse, and</p><p>4 0.62490714 <a title="1119-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-%E2%80%9CGross_misuse_of_statistics%E2%80%9D_can_be_a_good_thing%2C_if_it_indicates_the_acceptance_of_the_importance_of_statistical_reasoning.html">1276 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-“Gross misuse of statistics” can be a good thing, if it indicates the acceptance of the importance of statistical reasoning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rick Lightburn writes:
  
I [Lightburn] am also a member of the group Business  Analytics  on LinkedIn.  I am struck by what I perceive as the gross misuse of statistics by the members of this group, including things that (I thought) were taught in Introductory Statistics courses in business schools.  I want to suggest to you that you look at the discussions there if you want examples of such abuse.


The discussions there support me in my belief that Analytics is data manipulation in the support of previously developed conclusions.
  
My reply:  I don’t think it’s such a bad thing.  I like when people make statistical arguments, even bad statistical arguments.

<p>Introduction: The new book titled: Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science is now  available for download .
 
The official description makes the book sound pretty stuffy:
  
Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science, commissioned by the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) to celebrate its 50th anniversary and the International Year of Statistics, will be published in April by Taylor & Francis/CRC Press. Through the contributions of a distinguished group of 50 statisticians, the book showcases the breadth and vibrancy of statistics, describes current challenges and new opportunities, highlights the exciting future of statistical science, and provides guidance for future statisticians. Contributors are past COPSS award honorees.
  
But it actually has lots of good stuff, including the chapter by Tibshirani which I  discussed  last year (in the context of the “bet on sparsity principle”), and chapters by XL and other fun people.

<p>Introduction: I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I’d share an old story.
 
About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90232229 <a title="1119-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">1119 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association is seeking nominations for its annual  Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award .  The award was created in 2004 to encourage and recognize members of the communications media who have best displayed an informed interest in the science of statistics and its role in public life. The award can be given for a single statistical article or for a body of work.
 
Former winners of the award include:  Felix Salmon , financial blogger, 2010;  Sharon Begley , Newsweek, 2009; Mark Buchanan, New York Times, 2008; John Berry, Bloomberg News, 2005; and Gina Kolata, New York Times, 2004.
 
If anyone has any suggestions for the 2012 award, feel free to post in the comments or email me.</p><p>3 0.86357319 <a title="1119-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.


Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users can learn and p</p><p>4 0.81670201 <a title="1119-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Proposal_for_a_moratorium_on_the_use_of_the_words_%E2%80%9Cfashionable%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Ctrendy%E2%80%9D.html">189 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Proposal for a moratorium on the use of the words “fashionable” and “trendy”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>5 0.77663934 <a title="1119-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-26-Bad_news_about_%28some%29_statisticians.html">1282 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-26-Bad news about (some) statisticians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sociologist Fabio Rojas  reports  on “a conversation I [Rojas] have had a few times with statisticians”:
  
Rojas:  “What does your research tell us about a sample of, say, a few hundred cases?”


Statistician: “That’s not important. My result works as n–> 00.”


Rojas: “Sure, that’s a fine mathematical result, but I have to estimate the model with, like, totally finite data. I need inference, not limits. Maybe the estimate doesn’t work out so well for small n.”


Statistician: “Sure, but if you have a few million cases, it’ll work in the limit.”


Rojas: “Whoa. Have you ever collected, like, real world network data? A million cases is hard to get.”
  
The conversation continues in this frustrating vein.  Rojas writes:
  
This illustrates a fundamental issue in statistics (and other sciences). One you formalize a model and work mathematically, you are tempted to focus on what is mathematically interesting instead of the underlying problem motivating the science. . . .

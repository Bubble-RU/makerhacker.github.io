<p>Introduction: I’m on an island in Maine for a few weeks (big shout out for North Haven!)  This morning I picked up a copy of “Working Waterfront,” a newspaper that focuses on issues of coastal fishing communities.  I came across  an article  about modeling “fish” populations — actually lobsters, I guess they’re considered “fish” for regulatory purposes.  When I read it, I thought “wow, this article is really well-written, not dumbed down like articles in most newspapers.” I think it’s great that a small coastal newspaper carries reporting like this. (The online version has a few things that I don’t recall in the print version, too, so it’s even better).  But in addition to being struck by finding such a good article in a small newspaper, I was struck by this:
  
According to [University of Maine scientist Yong] Chen, there are four main areas where his model improved on the prior version. “We included the inshore trawl data from Maine and other state surveys, in addition to federal survey data; we h</p><p>3 0.086651973 <a title="1558-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-27-No_radon_lobby.html">238 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-27-No radon lobby</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser writes  thoughtfully  about the costs, benefits, and incentives for different policy recommendation options regarding a recent water crisis.  Good stuff:  it’s solid “freakonomics”–and I mean this in positive way:  a mix of economic and statistical analysis, with assumptions stated clearly.  Kaiser writes: 
  
Using the framework from Chapter 4, we should think about the incentives facing the Mass. Water Resources Authority:


A false positive error (people asked to throw out water when water is clean) means people stop drinking tap water temporarily, perhaps switching to bottled water, and the officials claim victory when no one falls sick, and businesses that produce bottled water experience a jump in sales. It is also very difficult to prove a “false positive” when people have stopped drinking the water. So this type of error is easy to hide behind.


A false negative error (people told it’s safe to drink water when water is polluted) becomes apparent when someone falls sick</p><p>4 0.080509551 <a title="1558-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-Climate_Change_News.html">180 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-Climate Change News</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).

<p>Introduction: As we said in Red State, Blue State, it’s not the Prius vs. the pickup truck, it’s the Prius vs. the Hummer.  Here’s the graph:
 
 
 
Or, as Ross Douthat put it in  an op-ed  yesterday:
  
This means that a culture war that’s often seen as a clash between liberal elites and a conservative middle America looks more and more like a conflict within the educated class — pitting Wheaton and Baylor against Brown and Bard, Redeemer Presbyterian Church against the 92nd Street Y, C. S. Lewis devotees against the Philip Pullman fan club.
  
Our main motivation for doing this work was to change how the news media think about America’s political divisions, and so it’s good to see our ideas getting mainstreamed and moving toward conventional wisdom.
  

 
P.S.  Here’s the time series of graphs showing how the pattern that we and Douthat noticed, of a battle between coastal states and middle America that is occurring among upper-income Americans, is relatively recent, having arisen in the Clinton ye</p><p>6 0.064398743 <a title="1558-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-25-100-year_floods.html">628 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-25-100-year floods</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang shares some bad news:
 
   
 
   
  
Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.


Chris Sheehan just sent me  this NYT article on air conditioning , where they mention this neat natural experiment:

<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya.

<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations.

<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

 
The hazards posed by climate change, sea level rise, and severe storm surges make this the time to transform our coastal cities through adaptive design. The conventional response to flooding, in recent history, has been hard engineering — fortifying the coastal infrastructure with seawalls and bulkheads to protect real estate at the expense of natural t</p><p>2 0.80924821 <a title="1558-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-25-%E2%80%9CWe_agree_that_everyone_deserves_a_second_chance._But_we_do_prefer_when_those_given_a_second_chance_acknowledge_that_they_did_something_wrong.%E2%80%9D.html">2077 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-25-“We agree that everyone deserves a second chance.

<p>Introduction: This is my last entry derived from  Anthony Burgess’s book reviews , and it’ll be short.  His review of Angus Wilson’s “The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling:  His Life and Works” is a wonderfully balanced little thing.  Nothing incredibly deep–like most items in the collection, the review is only two pages long–but I give it credit for being a rare piece of Kipling criticism I’ve seen that (a) seriously engages with the politics, without (b) congratulating itself on bravely going against the fashions of the politically incorrect chattering classes by celebrating Kipling’s magnificent achievement blah blah blah.  Instead, Burgess shows respect for Kipling’s work and puts it in historical, biographical, and literary context.
 
Burgess concludes that Wilson’s book “reminds us, in John Gross’s words, that Kipling ‘remains a haunting, unsettling presence, with whom we still have to come to terms.’  Still.”  Well put, and generous of Burgess to end his review with another’s quote.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>5 0.754426 <a title="1558-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-But_it_all_goes_to_pay_for_gas%2C_car_insurance%2C_and_tolls_on_the_turnpike.html">9 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-But it all goes to pay for gas, car insurance, and tolls on the turnpike</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a New Yorker I think I’m obliged to pass on the occasional Jersey joke (most recently,  this one , which annoyingly continues to attract spam comments).  I’ll let the above title be my comment on this  entry  from Tyler Cowen entitled, “Which Americans are ‘best off’?”:
  
If you consult human development indices the answer is Asians living in New Jersey.  The standard is:

 
The index factors in life expectancy at birth, educational degree attainment among adults 25-years or older, school enrollment for people at least three years old and median annual gross personal earnings.
 
  
More generally, these sorts of rankings and ndexes seem to be cheap ways of grabbing headlines.  This has always irritated me but really maybe I should go with the flow and invent a few of these indexes myself.</p><p>6 0.74047995 <a title="1558-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-09-The_difference_between_%E2%80%9Csignificant%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Cnon-significant%E2%80%9D_is_not_itself_statistically_significant.html">1662 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-09-The difference between “significant” and “non-significant” is not itself statistically significant</a></p>

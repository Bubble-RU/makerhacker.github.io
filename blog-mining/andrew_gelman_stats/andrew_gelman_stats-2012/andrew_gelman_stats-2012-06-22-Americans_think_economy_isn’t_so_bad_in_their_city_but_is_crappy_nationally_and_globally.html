<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>3 0.21625142 <a title="1388-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.18767475 <a title="1388-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.   But that is always the case.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago Larry Bartels  presented  this graph, a version of which latter appeared in his book Unequal Democracy:
 
 
 
Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy. This is consistent with Democrats’ general policies of lowering unemployment, as compared to Republicans lowering inflation, and, by comparing first-term to second-term presidents, he found that the result couldn’t simply be explained as a rebound or alternation pattern.
 
The question then arose, why have the Republicans won so many elections? Why aren’t the Democrats consistently dominating? Non-economic issues are part of the story, of course, but lots of evidence shows the economy to be a key concern for voters, so it’s still hard to see how, with a pattern such as shown above, the Republicans could keep winning.

<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>4 0.82351989 <a title="1388-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>

And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>5 0.81440961 <a title="1388-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.   But that is always the case.

<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9550252 <a title="1388-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-22-Americans_think_economy_isn%E2%80%99t_so_bad_in_their_city_but_is_crappy_nationally_and_globally.html">1388 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-22-Americans think economy isn’t so bad in their city but is crappy nationally and globally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Frank Newport of Gallup  reports  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Americans become progressively less positive about economic conditions the farther away from home they look. Forty-nine percent rate economic conditions in their local area as excellent or good, but that drops to 25% when rating the U.S. economy, and to 13% when assessing the world as a whole.
  
This is really wack:
 
   
 
I can see how it might make sense for Americans to think conditions are worse in other countries, but it’s hard to see a rational reason for the Lake-Wobegon-like pattern of people thinking things are ok locally but not nationally.
 
Gallup highlights the partisan breakdown, which I graphed here:
 
   
 
Unsurprisingly (given that their party controls the presidency and one house of Congress), Democrats are more optimistic than Republicans.  This is just the flip side of University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan claiming in October 2008 that the economy is not that bad because “the current unem</p><p>3 0.95026648 <a title="1388-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-More_bad_news%3A__The_%28mis%29reporting_of_statistical_results_in_psychology_journals.html">933 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-More bad news:  The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another entry in the growing literature on systematic flaws in the scientific research literature.
 
This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data. Regrettably, only 24% of the authors shared their data, despite our request</p><p>4 0.94645166 <a title="1388-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-07-Martyn_Plummer%E2%80%99s_Secret_JAGS_Blog.html">1045 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-07-Martyn Plummer’s Secret JAGS Blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martyn Plummer , the creator of the open-source, C++, graphical-model compiler  JAGS  (aka “Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), runs a forum on the JAGS site that has a very similar feel to the mail-bag posts on this blog.  Martyn answers general statistical computing questions (e.g., why slice sampling rather than Metropolis-Hastings?) and general modeling (e.g., why won’t my model converge with this prior?).
 
Here’s the link to the top-level JAGS site, and to the forum:
  
   JAGS Forum 
    JAGS Home Page 
   
The forum’s pretty active, with the stats page showing hundreds of views per day and very regular posts and answers.  Martyn’s last post was today.
 
Martyn also has a blog devoted to JAGS and other stats news:

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>6 0.94067138 <a title="1388-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-12-More_frustrations_trying_to_replicate_an_analysis_published_in_a_reputable_journal.html">1054 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-12-More frustrations trying to replicate an analysis published in a reputable journal</a></p>

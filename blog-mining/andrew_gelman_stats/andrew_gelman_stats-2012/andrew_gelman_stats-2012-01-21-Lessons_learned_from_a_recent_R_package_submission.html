You and your blog readers may be interested to know that a we’ve released a major new version of the BayesFactor package to CRAN. The package computes Bayes factors for linear mixed models and regression models. Of course, I’m aware you don’t like point-null model comparisons, but the package does more than that; it also allows sampling from posterior distributions of the compared models, in much the same way that your arm package does with lmer objects. The sampling (both for the Bayes factors and posteriors) is quite fast, since the back end is written in C.


Some basic examples using the package can be found  here , and the CRAN page is  here .
  
Indeed I don’t like point-null model comparisons . . . but maybe this will be useful to some of you!</p><p>3 0.19524369 <a title="1134-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-A_new_R_package_for_fititng_multilevel_models.html">501 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-A new R package for fititng multilevel models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joscha Legewie points to  this article  by Lars Ronnegard, Xia Shen, and Moudud Alam, “hglm: A Package for Fitting Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models,” which just appeared in the R journal.  This new package has the advantage, compared to lmer(), of allowing non-normal distributions for the varying coefficients.  On the downside, they seem to have reverted to the ugly lme-style syntax (for example, “fixed = y ~ week, random = ~ 1|ID” rather than “y ~ week + (1|D)”).  The old-style syntax has difficulties handling non-nested grouping factors.  They also say they can estimated models with correlated random effects, but isn’t that just the same as varying-intercept, varying-slope models, which lmer (or Stata alternatives such as gllam) can already do?  There’s also a bunch of stuff on H-likelihood theory, which seems pretty pointless to me (although probably it won’t do much harm either).
 
In any case, this package might be useful to some of you, hence this note.</p><p>4 0.1741378 <a title="1134-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-19-R_package_for_effect_size_calculations_for_psychology_researchers.html">2069 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-19-R package for effect size calculations for psychology researchers</a></p>

I read your  post  the other day [now the other month, as our blog is on a bit of a delay] on helping psychologists do research and thought you might be interested in our R package, “bootES”, for robust effect size calculation and confidence interval estimation using resampling techniques. The package provides one function, ‘bootES’, that makes a variety of effect size calculations fairly straightforward for researchers with limited programming experience.  The majority of the implemented are not available in R or SPSS without custom coding. Kris Kirby (Williams College) and I have published a paper in Behavioral Research Methods describing the methods and providing a tutorial on use of the package: http://bit.ly/YIM6VD. We hope that it’s useful to psychologists and other social science researchers!

<p>Introduction: We need help picking out an automatic differentiation package for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior of a  generalized linear model with deep interactions.  Specifically, we need to compute gradients for log probability functions with thousands of parameters that involve matrix (determinants, eigenvalues, inverses), stats (distributions), and math (log gamma) functions.  Any suggestions?
    
 The Application: Hybrid Monte Carlo for Posteriors 
 
We’re getting serious about implementing posterior sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC speeds up mixing by including gradient information to help guide the Metropolis proposals toward areas  high probability.  In practice, the algorithm requires a handful or  of gradient calculations per sample, but there are many dimensions and the functions are hairy enough we don’t want to compute derivaties by hand.

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:

<p>Introduction: This post is an (unpaid) advertisement for the following extremely useful resource:
  
 Petersen, K. B. and M. S. Pedersen. 2008.   The Matrix Cookbook  .  Tehcnical Report, Technical University of Denmark. 
  
It contains 70+ pages of useful relations and derivations involving matrices.  What grabbed my eye was the computation of gradients for matrix operations ranging from eigenvalues and determinants to multivariate normal density functions.   I had no idea the multivariate normal had such a clean gradient (see section 8).
  

 
We’ve been playing around with  Hamiltonian (aka Hybrid) Monte Carlo  for sampling from the posterior of hierarchical generalized linear models with lots of interactions.  HMC speeds up Metropolis sampling by using the gradient of the log probability to drive samples in the direction of higher probability density, which is particularly useful for correlated parameters that mix slowly with standard Gibbs sampling.

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>2 0.96555912 <a title="1134-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-How_to_think_about_Lou_Dobbs.html">335 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-How to think about Lou Dobbs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>3 0.95713973 <a title="1134-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-%28Partisan%29_visualization_of_health_care_legislation.html">178 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-(Partisan) visualization of health care legislation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Congressman  Kevin Brady  from Texas  distributes this visualization of reformed  health care  in the US (click for a bigger picture):
 
   
 
Here’s a  PDF  at Brady’s page, and a local  copy  of it.
 
Complexity has its costs. Beyond the cost of writing it, learning it, following it, there’s also the cost of checking it. John Walker has some  funny examples  of what’s hidden in the almost 8000 pages of IRS code.
 
Text mining and applied statistics will solve all that, hopefully. Anyone interested in developing a pork detection system for the legislation? Or an analysis of how much entropy to the legal code did each congressman contribute?
 
There are already  spin   detectors , that help you detect whether the writer is a Democrat (“stimulus”, “health care”) or a Republican (“deficit spending”, “ObamaCare”).

<p>Introduction: R has zillions of packages, and people are submitting  new ones each day .  The volunteers who keep R going are doing an incredibly useful service to the profession, and they’re  busy .
 
   
 
A colleague sends in some suugestions based on a recent experience with a package update:
  
 1. Always use the R dev version to write a package.  Not the current stable release.  The R people use the R dev version to check your package anyway.  If you don’t use the R dev version, there is chance that your package won’t pass the check.  In my own experience, every time R has a major change, it tends to have new standards and find new errors in your package with these new standards.  So better use the dev version to find out the potential errors in advance.


 2. After submission, write an email to claim it.   I used to submit the package to the CRAN without writing an email.  This was standard operating procedure, but it has changed. Writing an email to claim about the submission is now a requir</p><p>5 0.95222282 <a title="1134-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-31-Using_factor_analysis_or_principal_components_analysis_or_measurement-error_models_for_biological_measurements_in_archaeology%3F.html">1094 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-31-Using factor analysis or principal components analysis or measurement-error models for biological measurements in archaeology?</a></p>

I am a Canadian archaeologist (BSc in Chemistry) researching the past human use of European Atlantic shellfish. After two decades of practice I am finally getting a MA in archaeology at Reading. I am seeing if the habitat or size of harvested mussels (Mytilus edulis) can be reconstructed from measurements of the umbo (the pointy end, and the only bit that survives well in archaeological deposits) using log-transformed measurements (or allometry; relationships between dimensions are more likely exponential than linear). 
Of course multivariate regressions in most statistics packages (Minitab, SPSS, SAS) assume you are trying to predict one variable from all the others (a Model I regression), and use ordinary least squares to fit the regression line. For organismal dimensions this makes little sense, since all the dimensions are (at least in theory) free to change their mutual proportions during growth. So there is no predictor and predicted, mutual variation of</p><p>6 0.95060003 <a title="1134-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-08-Annals_of_spam.html">1488 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-08-Annals of spam</a></p>

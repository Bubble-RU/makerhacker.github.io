<p>Introduction: Galin Jones, Steve Brooks, Xiao-Li Meng and I edited a handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo that has  just been published .  My chapter (with Kenny Shirley) is  here , and it begins like this:
  
Convergence of Markov chain simulations can be monitored by measuring the diffusion and mixing of multiple independently-simulated chains, but different levels of convergence are appropriate for different goals. When considering inference from stochastic simulation, we need to separate two tasks: (1) inference about parameters and functions of parameters based on broad characteristics of their distribution, and (2) more precise computation of expectations and other functions of probability distributions. For the first task, there is a natural limit to precision beyond which additional simulations add essentially nothing; for the second task, the appropriate precision must be decided from external considerations. We illustrate with an example from our current research, a hierarchical model of t</p><p>6 0.049206339 <a title="1639-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-25-Apply_now_for_Earth_Institute_postdoctoral_fellowships_at_Columbia_University.html">971 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-25-Apply now for Earth Institute postdoctoral fellowships at Columbia University</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This story  of a Cindy Sherman impersonator reminded me of some graffiti I saw in a bathroom of the Whitney Museum many years ago.  My friend Kenny and I had gone there for the Biennial which had an exhibit featuring Keith Haring and others of the neo-taggers (or whatever they were called).  The bathroom walls were all painted over by Kenny Scharf [no relation to my friend] in his characteristically irritating doodle style.  On top of the ugly stylized graffiti was a Sharpie’d scrawl:  “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”
 
I suspected this last bit was added by someone else, but maybe it was Scharf himself?  Ira Glass is a bigshot and can get Cindy Sherman on the phone, but I was just some guy, all I could do was write Scharf a letter, c/o the Whitney Museum.

<p>Introduction: Ooooooh, I never ever thought I’d have a legitimate excuse to tell this story, and now I do!  The story took place many years ago, but first I have to tell you what made me think of it:
 
Rasmus Bååth  posted  the following comment last month:
  
On airplane tickets a Swedish “å” is written as “aa” resulting in Rasmus Baaaath. Once I bought a ticket online and five minutes later a guy from Lufthansa calls me and asks if I misspelled my name…
  
OK, now here’s my story (which is not nearly as good).  A long time ago (but when I was already an adult), I was in England for some reason, and I thought I’d take a day trip from London to Bath.  So here I am on line, trying to think of what to say at the ticket counter.  I remember that in England, they call Bath, Bahth.  So, should I ask for “a ticket to Bahth”?  I’m not sure, I’m afraid that it will sound silly, like I’m trying to fake an English accent.  So, when I get to the front of the line, I say, hesitantly, “I’d like a ticket to Bath?</p><p>4 0.69135767 <a title="1639-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-24-Bell_Labs.html">970 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-24-Bell Labs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>5 0.68927234 <a title="1639-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-22-Tenants_and_landlords.html">158 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-22-Tenants and landlords</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.
 
2.  A year after I graduated, the landlord actually did sell the place but then, when my friends moved out, he refused to pay back their security deposit.  There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.  So they sued the landlord in Mass. housing court</p><p>6 0.6797263 <a title="1639-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-12-black_and_Black%2C_white_and_White.html">1316 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-12-black and Black, white and White</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This story  of a Cindy Sherman impersonator reminded me of some graffiti I saw in a bathroom of the Whitney Museum many years ago.  My friend Kenny and I had gone there for the Biennial which had an exhibit featuring Keith Haring and others of the neo-taggers (or whatever they were called).  The bathroom walls were all painted over by Kenny Scharf [no relation to my friend] in his characteristically irritating doodle style.  On top of the ugly stylized graffiti was a Sharpie’d scrawl:  “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”
 
I suspected this last bit was added by someone else, but maybe it was Scharf himself?  Ira Glass is a bigshot and can get Cindy Sherman on the phone, but I was just some guy, all I could do was write Scharf a letter, c/o the Whitney Museum.  I described the situation and asked if he was the one who had written, “Kenny Scharf is a pretentious asshole.”  He did not reply.</p><p>2 0.88100398 <a title="1639-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Confusing_headline_and_capitalization_leads_to_hopes_raised%2C_then_dashed.html">1608 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Confusing headline and capitalization leads to hopes raised, then dashed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read the following under the  headline , Behind a Flop, a Play(wright) Within a Play”:
  
A stroll down West 45th Street in the theater district is all it takes to understand the contradictory fortunes facing David Mamet, for years the heavyweight of bare-knuckled American playwrights, as well as the producers who believe that loyalty to the writer makes good business sense.


At the Schoenfeld Theater is Mr. Mamet’s latest box-office hit: A revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross,” his Pulitzer Prize-winning crowd-pleaser from 1984 about an office of desperately scheming salesmen. The producers are charging up to $377 a ticket simply on the drawing power of their star, Al Pacino, even before its official opening this weekend.
  
My first thought was, Cool!  Mamet wrote a new play called “A revival of ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’” with a play within a play.
 
My second thought was, No way am I paying $377 a ticket for this.  Too bad it’s not more reasonably priced.

We’re working on this.  But, in the meantime, I recommend you click on  the blog itself  to see what’s been posted in the last few weeks.

<p>Introduction: I happened to be looking at Slate (I know, I know, but I’d already browsed Gawker and I was desperately avoiding doing real work) and came across this  article  by Alice Gregory entitled, “I Read Everything Janet Malcolm Ever Published. I’m in awe of her.”
 
I too think Malcolm is an excellent writer, but (a) I’m not happy that she gets off the hook for  faking quotes , and (b) I’m really really not happy with her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.
 
I just can’t get over that, for some reason.  I can appreciate Picasso’s genius even though he beat his wives or whatever it was he did, I can enjoy the music of Jackson Browne, etc.  But for some reason this Malcolm stuff sticks in my craw.  There’s no deep meaning to this—I recognize it is a somewhat irrational attitude on my part, I just wanted to share it with you.</p><p>6 0.48003593 <a title="1639-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi_Google_search_est_devenu_plus_raisonnable%3F.html">207 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi Google search est devenu plus raisonnable?</a></p>

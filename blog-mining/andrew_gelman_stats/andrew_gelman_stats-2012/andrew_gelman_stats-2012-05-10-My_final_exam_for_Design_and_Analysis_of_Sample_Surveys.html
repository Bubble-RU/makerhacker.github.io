<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>4 0.14667414 <a title="1311-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-06-Question_27_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1368 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-06-Question 27 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 27. Which of the following problems were identified with the Burnham et al. survey of Iraq mortality? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) The survey used cluster sampling, which is inappropriate for estimating individual out- comes such as death.
 
(b) In their report, Burnham et al. did not identify their primary sampling units.
 
(c) The second-stage sampling was not a probability sample.
 
(d) Survey materials supplied by the authors are incomplete and inconsistent with published descriptions of the survey.
 
 Solution to question 26 
 
From  yesterday :
  
26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)


(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination</p><p>5 0.14518651 <a title="1311-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-22-The_Jumpstart_financial_literacy_survey_and_the_different_purposes_of_tests.html">481 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-22-The Jumpstart financial literacy survey and the different purposes of tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  comments on  the (presumably) well-intentioned but silly  Jumpstart test of financial literacy , which was given to 7000 high school seniors  Given that, as we heard a few years back, most high school seniors can’t locate Miami on a map of the U.S., you won’t be surprised to hear that they flubbed item after item on this quiz.
 
But, as Palko points out, the concept is better than the execution:
  
 
With the complex, unstable economy, the shift away from traditional pensions and the constant flood of new financial products, financial literacy might be more important now than it has been for decades. You could even make the case for financial illiteracy being a major cause of the economic crisis.


But if the supporters of financial literacy need a good measure of how well we’re doing, they’ll need to find a better instrument than the Jump$tart survey.


The ‘test’ part of the survey consists of thirty-one questions. That’s not very long but that many questions should be su</p><p>6 0.1375286 <a title="1311-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-01-Non-topical_blogging.html">1964 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-01-Non-topical blogging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We’re having a  fun discussion this week  on invovis vs. statistical graphics.  Michael Lavine has contributed a couple of posts.
 
Next week will be our special Joint Statistical Meeting edition:  we’ll be having several guest-bloggers post on the interesting and amusing encounters they’ve had each day.
 
Then after that we’ll be moving to monthly theme issues:  Each month we’ll solicit several different posts on a particular topic.</p><p>5 0.71738279 <a title="1311-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-18-G%2B_hangout_for_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_course_now%21_%28actually%2C_in_5_minutes%29.html">2068 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-18-G+ hangout for Bayesian Data Analysis course now!

<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?

<p>Introduction: We had 28 class periods, so I wrote an exam with an approximate correspondence of one question per class.  Rather than dumping the exam in your lap all at once, I’ll post the questions once per day.  Then each day I’ll post the answer to yesterday’s questions.  So it will be 29 days in all.  I’ll post them to appear late in the day so as not to interfere with our main daily posts (which are currently backed up to early June).
 
The course was offered in the political science department and covered a mix of statistical and political topics.  Followers of our  recent discussion  on test questions won’t be surprised to learn that some of the questions are ambiguous.  This wasn’t on purpose.  I tried my best, but good questions are hard to write.
 
Question 1 will appear tomorrow.</p><p>2 0.94751096 <a title="1311-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-22-The_scaled_inverse_Wishart_prior_distribution_for_a_covariance_matrix_in_a_hierarchical_model.html">1466 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-22-The scaled inverse Wishart prior distribution for a covariance matrix in a hierarchical model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we’re  talking  about the scaled inverse Wishart . . . here’s a recent message from Chris Chatham:
 
I have been reading your book on Bayesian Hierarchical/Multilevel Modeling but have been struggling a bit with deciding whether to model my multivariate normal distribution using the scaled inverse Wishart approach you advocate given the arguments at  this blog post  [entitled "Why an inverse-Wishart prior may not be such a good idea"].
 
My reply:  We discuss this in our book.  We know the inverse-Wishart has problems, that’s why we recommend the  scaled  inverse-Wishart, which is a more general class of models.   Here ‘s an old blog post on the topic.  And also of course there’s the description in our book.
 
Chris pointed me to the following  comment  by Simon Barthelmé:
  
Using the scaled inverse Wishart doesn’t change anything, the standard deviations of the invidual coefficients and their covariance are still dependent. My answer would be to use a prior that models the stan</p><p>3 0.9448725 <a title="1311-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-18-Standardizing_regression_inputs.html">1462 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-18-Standardizing regression inputs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andy Flies, Ph.D. candidate in zoology, writes:
  
After reading your paper about scaling regression inputs by two standard deviations I found your  blog post  stating that you wished you had scaled by 1 sd and coded the binary inputs as -1 and 1.  Here is my question:


If you code the binary input as -1 and 1, do you then standardize it?  This makes sense to me because the mean of the standardized input is then zero and the sd is 1, which is what the mean and sd are for all of the other standardized inputs.  I know that if you code the binary input as 0 and 1 it should not be standardized.


Also, I am not interested in the actual units (i.e. mg/ml) of my response variable and I would like to compare a couple of different response variables that are on different scales.  Would it make sense to standardize the response variable also?
  
My reply:  No, I donâ&euro;&trade;t standardize the binary input.  The point of standardizing inputs is to make the coefs directly interpretable, but with binary i</p><p>4 0.92265612 <a title="1311-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-08-Blogging%3A__Is_it_%E2%80%9Cfair_use%E2%80%9D%3F.html">458 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-08-Blogging:  Is it “fair use”?</a></p>

I [Kane] am involved in a dispute relating to whether or not a blog can be considered part of one’s academic writing.  Williams College restricts the use of undergraduate theses as follows:

 
Non-commercial, academic use within the scope of “Fair Use” standards is acceptable. Otherwise, you may not copy or distribute any content without the permission of the copyright holder.
 

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.
      
Parenthetically, your readers might be interested in the substantive discovery here, the details of the Williams admissions process (which is probably very similar to Columbia’s). Williams places students into academic rating (AR) categories as follows:

I [Lightburn] am also a member of the group Business  Analytics  on LinkedIn.  I am struck by what I perceive as the gross misuse of statistics by the members of this group, including things that (I thought) were taught in Introductory Statistics courses in business schools.  I want to suggest to you that you look at the discussions there if you want examples of such abuse.


The discussions there support me in my belief that Analytics is data manipulation in the support of previously developed conclusions.
  
My reply:  I don’t think it’s such a bad thing.  I like when people make statistical arguments, even bad statistical arguments.

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?
 
In the meantime, if anybody feels like setting up a wikipedia entry for the research of Columbia’s statistics faculty, that</p><p>4 0.12150033 <a title="1643-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Controversy_about_average_personality_differences_between_men_and_women.html">1114 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Controversy about average personality differences between men and women</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).
  
Echidne  quotes  a  news article  in which one of the study’s authors going overboard:

<p>Introduction: What can we learn about an author from his or her fiction?  This is an old, old question, I know.  But I still can’t help thinking about it when I read a book.
 
 John Updike ‘s stories are full of male characters whom women find irresistibly attractive.  I can only assume that this reflects Updike’s own experiences, to some extent.  If he had not been, in reality, catnip to women, I imagine he’d have made more of a big deal about the episodes in his books where women kept falling into his protagonists’ laps.
 
Same for  John D. Macdonald , although there I suppose it’s possible he was just throwing in the sex to sell books.
 
And even more so for  Richard Ford .  This guy’s male characters are so smooth, there’s no way that Ford isn’t/wasn’t like that too.
 
What about Lorrie Moore?  I think she must have had a very frustrating life (so far).  I say this because her stories always seem to be centered around a female character who is witty, thoughtful, and refined, and surrounded by re</p><p>6 0.11521972 <a title="1643-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-16-Another_update_on_the_spam_email_study.html">35 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-16-Another update on the spam email study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan sends in  this  horror story:
  
A new study finds that atheists are among society’s most distrusted group, comparable even to rapists in certain circumstances.


Psychologists at the University of British Columbia and the University of Oregon say that their study demonstrates that anti-atheist prejudice stems from moral distrust, not dislike, of nonbelievers.


“It’s pretty remarkable,” said Azim Shariff, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and a co-author of the study, which appears in the current issue of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.


The study, conducted among 350 Americans adults and 420 Canadian college students, asked participants to decide if a fictional driver damaged a parked car and left the scene, then found a wallet and took the money, was the driver more likely to be a teacher, an atheist teacher, or a rapist teacher?

<p>Introduction: Here’s a pretty funny example of silly statistics, caught by  Lisa Wade :
 
 A study  published in 2001 . . . asked undergraduate college students their favorite color and presented the results by sex.  Men’s favorites are on the left, women’s on the right:
 
 
 
The authors of the study, Lee Ellis and Christopher Ficek, wrote:
  
We are inclined to suspect the involvement of neurohormonal factors. Studies of rats have found average sex differences in the number of neurons comprising various parts of the visual cortex. Also, gender differences have been found in rat preferences for the amount of sweetness in drinking water. One experiment demonstrated that the sex differences in rat preferences for sweetness was eliminated by depriving males of male-typical testosterone levels in utero. Perhaps, prenatal exposure to testosterone and other sex hormones operates in a similar way to “bias” preferences for certain colors in humans.

<p>Introduction: You know that expression, “Not from the Onion”?  How did we say that, all those years before the Onion existed?
 
I was thinking about this after encountering (amidst a Google search for something else)  this article  on a website called “College News”:
  
DANVILLE, KY., March 8, 2007–Two Centre College professors spent the past six years reading and analyzing 200 children’s books to discover a disturbing trend: gender bias still exists in much of modern children’s literature.


Dr. David Anderson, professor of economics, and Dr. Mykol Hamilton, professor of psychology, have documented that gender bias is common today in many children’s books in their research published recently in Sex Roles: A Journal of Research titled “Gender Stereotyping and Under-Representation of Female Characters in 200 Popular Children’s Picture Books: A 21st Century Update.” . . .

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. . . . In a randomized double-blind study . . . science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. . . .
  
I hate to talk about things like this since presumably I’m a beneficiary.  But now that I’ve climbed the ladder myself I suppose I’m not at any risk.  I don’t know anything much about lab manager positions—that’s more something you’d see in a biology department—but I do</p><p>2 0.96652329 <a title="1643-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-18-uuuuuuuuuuuuugly.html">1862 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-18-uuuuuuuuuuuuugly</a></p>

My reply:  All’s well with me.  And yes, that’s one horrible graph.  It has all the problems with a bad infographic with none of the virtues.  Compared to this monstrosity, the typical USA Today graph is a stunning, beautiful masterpiece.  I don’t think I want to soil this webpage with the image.

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>4 0.95715511 <a title="1643-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Help_with_this_problem%2C_win_valuable_prizes.html">1164 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Help with this problem, win valuable prizes</a></p>

In the comments to  an earlier post , I mentioned a problem I am struggling with right now. Several people mentioned having (and solving!) similar problems in the past, so this seems like a great way for me and a bunch of other blog readers to learn something. I will describe the problem, one or more of you will tell me how to solve it, and you will win…wait for it….my thanks, and the approval and admiration of your fellow blog readers, and a big thank-you in any publication that includes results from fitting the model.  You can’t ask fairer than that!
 
Here’s the problem.  The goal is to estimate six parameters that characterize the leakiness (or air-tightness) of a house with an attached garage.  We are specifically interested in the parameters that describe the connection between the house and the garage; this is of interest because of the effect on the air quality in the house  if there are toxic chemic</p><p>5 0.95354104 <a title="1643-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-The_most_dangerous_jobs_in_America.html">1086 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-The most dangerous jobs in America</a></p>

On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>6 0.95165509 <a title="1643-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-09-%E2%80%9CMuch_of_the_recent_reported_drop_in_interstate_migration_is_a_statistical_artifact%E2%80%9D.html">404 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-09-“Much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact”</a></p>

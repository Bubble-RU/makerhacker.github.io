<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.

<p>Introduction: 24. A supermarket chain has 100 equally-sized stores. It is desired to estimate the proportion of vegetables that spoil before being sold. The following sampling designs are considered:
 
(a) Sample 10 stores, then sample half the vegetables within each of these stores; or
 
(b) Sample 20 stores, then sample one-quarter of the vegetables within each of these stores.
 
Which of these designs has the lowest variance? Why might the higher-variance design still be chosen?
 
 Solution to question 23 
 
From  yesterday :
  
23. Suppose you are conducting a survey in which people are asked about their health behaviors (how often they wash their hands, how often they go to the doctor, etc.). There is a concern that different interviewers will get different sorts of responses√¢&euro;&rdquo;that is, there may be important interviewer effects. Describe (in two sentences) how you could estimate the interviewer effects within your survey. Can the interviewer effects create problems of reliability of the survey r</p><p>4 0.34561566 <a title="1365-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-01-Question_22_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1358 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-01-Question 22 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 22. A supermarket chain has 100 equally-sized stores. It is desired to estimate the proportion of vegetables that spoil before being sold. Three stores are selected at random and are checked: the percent of spoiled vegetables are 3%, 5%, and 10% in the three stores. Give an estimate and standard error for the percentage of spoiled vegetables for the entire chain.
 
 Solution to question 21 
 
From  yesterday :
  
21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
  
Solution:  Nonproportional sampling is usually avoided because it makes the analysis more complicated and it results in a higher standard error for estimates of the general population.  It might be a good idea her</p><p>5 0.32889771 <a title="1365-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-09-Mister_P%3A__What%E2%80%99s_its_secret_sauce%3F.html">2056 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-09-Mister P:  What‚Äôs its secret sauce?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science‚Äîand soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It‚Äôs taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power‚Äîas well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.
 
As a method becomes used more and more widely, there will be natural concerns about its domains of applicability.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  our discussion  the other day, Matt Buttice and Ben Highton write:
  
It was nice to see our article mentioned and discussed by Andrew, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza on Andrew‚Äôs blog in this post on Wednesday.  As noted in the post, we recently published an  article  in Political Analysis on how well multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) performs at producing estimates of state opinion with conventional national surveys where N‚âà1,500.  Our central claims are that (i) the performance of MRP is highly variable, (ii) in the absence of knowing the true values, it is difficult to determine the quality of the MRP estimates produced on the basis of a single national sample, and, (iii) therefore, our views about the usefulness of MRP in instances where a researcher has a single sample of N‚âà1,500 are less optimistic than the ones expressed in previous research on the topic.

<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton‚Äôs evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>5 0.78170931 <a title="1365-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-Question_26_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1367 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-Question 26 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, here‚Äôs something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who‚Äôs famous for his innovative treatment for ‚Äúphantom limb‚Äù pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . ‚ÄúOh, my God!‚Äù the man began</p><p>2 0.92937797 <a title="1365-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It‚Äôs official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It‚Äôs sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan‚Äôs home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user‚Äôs guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual

<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>4 0.89725369 <a title="1365-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-15-Last_word_on_Mister_P_%28for_now%29.html">2062 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-15-Last word on Mister P (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton‚Äôs evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>5 0.89654672 <a title="1365-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-Improvements_to_Kindle_Version_of_BDA3.html">1993 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-Improvements to Kindle Version of BDA3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew‚Äôs second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>6 0.89637947 <a title="1365-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-‚ÄúAll Models are Right, Most are Useless‚Äù</a></p>

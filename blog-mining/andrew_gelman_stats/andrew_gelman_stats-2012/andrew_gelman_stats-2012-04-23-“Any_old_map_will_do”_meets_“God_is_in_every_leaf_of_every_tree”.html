<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>3 0.20290022 <a title="1278-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-19-Believe_your_models_%28up_to_the_point_that_you_abandon_them%29.html">1269 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-19-Believe your models (up to the point that you abandon them)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a discussion of his variant of the write-a-thousand-words-a-day strategy (as he puts it, “a system for the production of academic results in writing”), Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
Believe the claims you are making. That is, confine yourself to making claims you believe. I always emphasize this when I [Basbøll] define knowledge as “justified, true belief”. . . . I think if there is one sure way to undermine your sense of your own genius it is to begin to say things you know to be publishable without being sure they are true. Or even things you know to be “true” but don’t understand well enough to believe.
  
He points out that this is not so easy:
  
In times when there are strong orthodoxies it can sometimes be difficult to know what to believe. Or, rather, it is all too easy to know what to believe (what the “right belief” is). It is therefore difficult to stick to statements of one’s own belief. I sometimes worry that our universities, which are systems of formal education and for</p><p>4 0.19706318 <a title="1278-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-13-Retractions%2C_retractions%3A__%E2%80%9Cleft-wing_enough_to_not_care_about_truth_if_it_confirms_their_social_theories%2C_right-wing_enough_to_not_care_as_long_as_they%E2%80%99re_getting_paid_enough%E2%80%9D.html">1415 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-13-Retractions, retractions:  “left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two news items.
 
1.  A couple people pointed me to the  uncovering  of another fraudulent Dutch psychology researcher—this time it was Dirk Smeesters, rather than  Diederik Stapel .  It’s hard to keep these guys straight—they all pretty much have the same names and do the same things.
 
Stapel and Smeesters also seem to live in the same postmodernist/business-school nexus:  left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough.
 
In the comments to the Retraction Watch post, Richard Gill  writes , “it looks to me [Gill] like Smeesters was subjected to medieval torture and confessed.”  Medieval torture, huh?  I haven’t seen Holy Grail in many years but I recall that’s pretty rough stuff, of the sort that even John Yoo might think twice about.  I followed the links and didn’t see what the torture was, but I have to admit I didn’t even try to read the Dutch documents.  On the upside, Gill follow</p><p>5 0.17013544 <a title="1278-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-23-No_one_knows_what_it%E2%80%99s_like_to_be_the_bad_man.html">1588 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-23-No one knows what it’s like to be the bad man</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: In “Story:  A Definition,” visual analysis researcher Robert Kosara  writes :
  
A story

 
 ties facts together. There is a reason why this particular collection of facts is in this story, and the story gives you that reason. 
 provides a narrative path through those facts. In other words, it guides the viewer/reader through the world, rather than just throwing them in there. 
 presents a particular interpretation of those facts. A story is always a particular path through a world, so it favors one way of seeing things over all others. 
 
  
The relevance of these ideas to statistical graphics is apparent.
 
From a completely different direction, in “When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences,” Thomas Basbøll and I  write :

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”

<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

I saw your  recent blog post  where you discussed in passing an iterative-chain-of models approach to AI. 


I essentially built such a thing for  my PhD thesis  – not in a Bayesian context, but in a logic programming context – and proved it had a few properties and showed how you could solve some toy problems. The important bit of my framework was that at various points you also go and get more data in the process – in a statistical context this might be seen as building a little univariate model on a subset of the data, then iteratively extending into a better model with more data and more independent variables – a generalized forward stepwise regression if you like.  It wrapped a proper computational framework around E.M. Gold’s identification/learning in the limit based on a logic my advisor (Eric Martin) had invented.

<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

<p>Introduction: In an article provocatively entitled, “Will Ohio State’s football team decide who wins the White House?”, Tyler Cowen and Kevin Grier  report :
  
It is statistically possible that the outcome of a handful of college football games in the right battleground states could determine the race for the White House.


Economists Andrew Healy, Neil Malhotra, and Cecilia Mo make this argument in a fascinating article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. They examined whether the outcomes of college football games on the eve of elections for presidents, senators, and governors affected the choices voters made. They found that a win by the local team, in the week before an election, raises the vote going to the incumbent by around 1.5 percentage points. When it comes to the 20 highest attendance teams—big athletic programs like the University of Michigan, Oklahoma, and Southern Cal—a victory on the eve of an election pushes the vote for the incumbent up by 3 percentage points.

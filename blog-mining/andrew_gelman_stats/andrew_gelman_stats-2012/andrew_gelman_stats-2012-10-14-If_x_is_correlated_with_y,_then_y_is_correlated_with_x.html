<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>4 0.086650901 <a title="1533-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-More_consulting_experiences%2C_this_time_in_computational_linguistics.html">1596 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-More consulting experiences, this time in computational linguistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>5 0.083851717 <a title="1533-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-What_is_expected_of_a_consultant.html">1597 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-What is expected of a consultant</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.

<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally. And 64 percent of its prostate cancer patients are alive at three years, vers</p><p>5 0.73569155 <a title="1533-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-16-%E2%80%9CNightshifts_Linked_to_Increased_Risk_for_Ovarian_Cancer%E2%80%9D.html">1766 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-16-“Nightshifts Linked to Increased Risk for Ovarian Cancer”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Zosia Chustecka  writes : 
  
  
Much of the previous work on the link between cancer and nightshifts has focused on breast cancer . . . The latest report, focusing on ovarian cancer,  was published  in the April issue of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.


This increase in the risk for ovarian cancer with nightshift work is consistent with, and of similar magnitude to, the risk for breast cancer, say lead author Parveen Bhatti, PhD, and colleagues from the epidemiology program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.


The researchers examined data from a local population-based cancer registry that is part of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. They identified 1101 women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, 389 with borderline disease, and 1832 without ovarian cancer (control group).

<p>Introduction: Michael Collins ( here’s  a link but I don’t know the original source) picked up on  my article  about statistics and the cigarette companies, which mentioned a consulting job of famed Stanford statistician Ingram Olkin, and noticed that Olkin was recently in the news as a coauthor of a report on organic food:
  
A widely publicized study claiming that there is no demonstrated difference in nutritional value between organically and conventionally grown foods just appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Broad mainstream media coverage produced headlines like Stanford Scientists Cast Doubt on Advantages of Organic Meat and Produce. The media failed to mention one point that may be of major interest. . . . The article co-author with recognized expertise in meta-analysis, Ingram Olkin, applied for a grant from Council of Tobacco Research (CTR) in 1976. . . . Olkin applied to the CTR to conduct a project on the statistical methods used in the Framingham Heart Study, the landmark projec</p><p>2 0.91576684 <a title="1533-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-Huh%3F.html">1915 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-Huh?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  our discussion  of historian Niall Ferguson and piss-poor monocausal social science, commenter Matt W. pointed to Ferguson’s listing at a speakers bureau.  One of his talks is entitled “Is This the Chinese Century?”  The question mark at the end seems to give him some wiggle room.
 
I give some paid lectures myself and was curious to learn more about this organization, World Class Speakers and Entertainers, so I clicked through to  this list of topics  and then searched for Statistics.  Amazingly enough, there was a “Statistician” category (right above “Story Teller / Lore / Art / Power of Story Telling,” “Strategist / Strategies / Strategic Planning,” and “Success”).
 
There I found  Gopal C. Dorai, Ph.D. , who offers insights such as “vegetarians usually will not eat meat products, no matter how hungry they feel.”  And “Cheating or lying for the sake of obtaining favorable treatment from others will be anathema to some people.”  And “Life is a one-way-street; we cannot turn the c</p><p>4 0.89504445 <a title="1533-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-06-My_talk_at_Northwestern_University_tomorrow_%28Thursday%29.html">651 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-06-My talk at Northwestern University tomorrow (Thursday)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Of Beauty, Sex, and Power: Statistical Challenges in Estimating Small Effects.  At the Institute of Policy Research,  Thurs 7 Apr 2011, 3.30pm .
 
Regular blog readers know all about this topic.  ( Here  are the slides.)  But, rest assured, I donâ&euro;&trade;t just mock. I also offer constructive suggestions.
 
My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.
 
P.S.  I searched on the web and also found  this announcement  which gives the wrong title.</p><p>5 0.8674109 <a title="1533-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-21-Workshop_on_science_communication_for_graduate_students.html">1687 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-21-Workshop on science communication for graduate students</a></p>

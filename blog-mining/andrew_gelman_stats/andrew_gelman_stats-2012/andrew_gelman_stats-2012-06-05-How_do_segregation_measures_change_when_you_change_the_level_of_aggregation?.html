<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.10319942 <a title="1366-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-25-A_statistical_graphics_course_and_statistical_graphics_advice.html">2266 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-25-A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a></p>

Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

<p>Introduction: Hey, and I did it in less than 140 characters!  The above was my response to  this item  which David Hogg forwarded to me.
 
The next thing you know, people are going to claim that women are three times as likely to wear  red  pink when . . . Naaah, forget about it, that would never happen.
 
Hmmm, I think the above is not so savvy of me, to just go around insulting a whole bunch of people.  So let me just say that becoming numerate is not as easy as it might seem.  All of us can be gullible in areas outside of our expertise.  Indeed, I’ve fallen for the occasional April Fool’s gag myself.
 
And, maybe it’s not really right for me to say that “Twitter sucks.”  Sure, the downside of Twitter is that people can just pass along a silly joke, not realizing it’s a joke at all.  But the upside is, I hope, that once people have committed themselves and then realize they were mistaken, they’ll think harder the next time they see something like that.

<p>Introduction: Under the subject line “Blog bait!”, Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  post at the Washington Post blog:
  
For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.


    
Infographic by Thomas Porostocky for WIRED.


“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>3 0.76653022 <a title="1366-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-17-Is_chartjunk_really_%E2%80%9Cmore_useful%E2%80%9D_than_plain_graphs%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_so..html">37 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-17-Is chartjunk really “more useful” than plain graphs?  I don’t think so.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.

<p>Introduction: From blogger  Matthew Yglesias :
 
 
 
There are lots of great graphs all over the web (see, for example,  here  and  here  for some snappy pictures of unemployment trends from blogger “Geoff”).
 
There’s nothing special about Yglesias’s graph.  In fact, the reason I’m singling it out as “graph of the year” is  because  it’s not special.
  

 
It’s a display of three numbers, with no subtlety or artistry in its presentation.  True, it has some good features: 
- Clear title 
- Clearly labeled axes 
- Vertical axis goes to zero 
- The cities are in a sensible order (not, for example, alphabetical) 
- The graphs is readable; none of that 3-D “data visualization” crap that looks cool but distances the reader from the numbers being displayed.
 
What’s impressive about the above graph, what makes it a landmark to me, is that it was made at all.

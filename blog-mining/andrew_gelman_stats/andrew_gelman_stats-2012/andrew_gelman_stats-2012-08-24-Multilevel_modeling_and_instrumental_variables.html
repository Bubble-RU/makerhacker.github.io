I am using a multilevel model with three levels. I read that you wrote a book about multilevel models, and wonder if you can solve the following question.  


The data structure is like this: 


Level one: customer (8444 customers) 
Level two: companys (90 companies) 
Level three: industry (17 industries) 


I use 6 level-three variables (i.e. industry characteristics) to explain the variance of the level-one effect across industries. The question here is whether there is an over-fitting problem since there are only 17 industries. I understand that this must be a problem for non-multilevel models, but is it also a problem for multilevel models?
  
My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.

<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent.

Suppose I have survey data from  say 10 countries where by each country collected the data based on different sampling routines –  the results of this being that  each country has its own weights for the data that can be used in the analyses.

1.  I analyse the data from each country separately (using multiple or logistic regression, …) accounting for the survey design and then combine the estimates using a meta analysis (fixed or random)

<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.

I viewed your 2005 presentation “Interactions in multilevel models” and was hoping you or one of your students/colleagues could point me to some readings about the issue of using all possible vs. only particular interaction terms in regression models with continuous covariates (I think “functional form validity” is the term I have encountered in the past). 


In particular, I am trying to understand whether I would be mis-specifying a model if I deleted two of its interaction terms (in favor of using only 2-way treatment interaction terms). The general full model, for example, is:


Y = intercept + txt + pre1 + pre2 + txt*pre1 + txt*pre2 + pre1*pre2 + txt*pre1*pre2, where txt is effect coded (1=treatment, -1=control) and pre1 and pre2 are two different pretests that are assumed normally distributed. (The model is actually a multilevel model; the error terms are not listed for brevity.)

<p>Introduction: I think cross-validation is a good way to estimate a model’s forecasting error but I don’t think it’s always such a great tool for comparing models.  I mean, sure, if the differences are dramatic, ok.  But you can easily have a few candidate models, and one model makes a lot more sense than the others (even from a purely predictive sense, I’m not talking about causality here).  The difference between the model doesn’t show up in a xval measure of total error but in the patterns of the predictions.
 
For a simple example, imagine using a linear model with positive slope to model a function that is constrained to be increasing.  If the constraint isn’t in the model, the predicted/imputed series will sometimes be nonmonotonic.  The effect on the prediction error can be so tiny as to be undetectable (or it might even increase avg prediction error to include the constraint); nonetheless, the predictions will be clearly nonsensical.

My brief feedback is that water is confounded with these results. They should have subtracted water content from the weight of all dietary items, as it inflates the proportion of milk, vegetable and fruit items that contain more water. They did that for soda (which is represented as sugar/corn syrup), amplifying the inconsistency.

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.

<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>5 0.90617967 <a title="1468-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-14-GPstuff%3A_Bayesian_Modeling_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">1856 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-14-GPstuff: Bayesian Modeling with Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.
 
Jarno Vanhatalo, Jaakko Riihimäki, Jouni Hartikainen, Pasi Jylänki, Ville Tolvanen, and Aki Vehtari  write :
  
The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

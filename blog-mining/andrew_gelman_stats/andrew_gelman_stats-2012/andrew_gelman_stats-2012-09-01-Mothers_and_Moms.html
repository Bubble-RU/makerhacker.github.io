<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about that Yale professor who wrote that book,  remember , she screamed at her daughters all the time and didn’t let them go the bathroom while they were practicing piano (violin?), Asian parenting-style etc etc.
 
I was just wondering . . . what if she’d had sons rather than daughters?  What are the rules?  Would bringing up boys be the job of mellow white dad rather than intense Asian mom?  If mom were still in charge, would the boys be doing piano, or something else like hockey?  Tiger Mom seems to be into traditional values so I’m assuming she’d want her kids doing something sex-stereotyped?  But sports would be tough, her (hypothetical) boys would have to compete with big strong athletes and would be less likely to be winners so then she couldn’t brag about her amazing parenting skills.
 
I really don’t know the answer to this one.  Maybe some of our readers who are Yale law professors can enlighten us?</p><p>3 0.099133708 <a title="1479-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-16-How_much_can_we_learn_about_individual-level_causal_claims_from_state-level_correlations%3F.html">2336 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-16-How much can we learn about individual-level causal claims from state-level correlations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, we all know the answer:  “correlation does not imply causation”—but of course life is more complicated than that.  As philosophers, economists, statisticians, and others have repeatedly noted, most of our information about the world is observational not experimental, yet we manage to draw causal conclusions all the time.  Sure, some of these conclusions are wrong (more often than 5% of the time, I’m sure) but that’s an accepted part of life.
 
Challenges in this regard arise in the design of a study, in the statistical analysis, in how you write it up for a peer-reviewed journal, and finally in how you present it to the world.
 
 School sports and life outcomes 
 
An interesting case of all this came up recently in a post on  Freakonomics  that pointed to a post on  Deadspin  that pointed to a  research article .

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  from David Gorski (which I found via  this  link from Joseph Delaney).
 
I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.  It’s only n=1 and adds almost nothing to the literature on the effectiveness of various treatments, but a story like this can help focus one’s thoughts on the decision problems.</p><p>5 0.086951084 <a title="1479-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>6 0.083257318 <a title="1479-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-17-How_to_think_about_the_statistical_evidence_when_the_statistical_evidence_can%E2%80%99t_be_conclusive%3F.html">2174 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-17-How to think about the statistical evidence when the statistical evidence can’t be conclusive?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After I recently  criticized  Gregg Easterbrook for assigning Obama an implausible 90+% chance of beating Mitt Romney, some commenters thought I was being too critical, that I should cut Easterbrook some slack because he just was speaking metaphorically.
 
In other words, Easterbrook is a “qual.”  He uses numbers in his writing because that’s what everyone is supposed to do nowadays, but he doesn’t intend those numbers to be meant literally.  Similarly, he presumably didn’t really mean it when he  wrote  that Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren “couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.”  And he had no problem  typing  that Obama’s approval rating was 23% because, to him, “23%” is just another word for “low.”
 
He’s a qual, that’s all.
 
Similarly, when Samantha Power was just being a qual when she wrote the meaningful-sounding but actually empty statement, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican pres</p><p>3 0.8053664 <a title="1479-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians_vs._everybody_else.html">582 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians vs. everybody else</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Statisticians are literalists.
 
When someone says that the U.K. boundary commission’s delay in redistricting gave the Tories an advantage equivalent to 10 percent of the vote, we’re the kind of person who  looks it up  and claims that the effect is less than 0.7 percent.
 
When someone says, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican presidents in times of perceived danger and Democrats in times of relative calm,” we’re like, Hey, really?  And we go look  that one  up too.
 
And when someone says that engineers have more sons and nurses have more daughters . . . well, let’s not go there.
 
So, when I was pointed to  this blog  by Michael O’Hare making the following claim, in the context of K-12 education in the United States:

<p>Introduction: Seeing Sarah Palin’s recent  witticism :
  
It’s no wonder Michelle Obama is telling everybody you need to breast feed your babies … the price of milk is so high!
  
I was reminded of Dan Quayle’s quip during the 1988 campaign:
  
The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber ducky drowned in the bathtub.
  
And this got me wondering:  how often do legitimate political figures–not talk show hosts, but actual politicians–communicate via schoolyard-style taunts?
  

 
I’m not talking here about dry wit of the Bob Dole or Morris Udall variety, or political gamesmanship such as Ronald Reagan’s “make my day,” or flat-out partisanship like Alan Grayson’s “the Republicans want you to die quickly” or James Watt’s line about “liberals and Americans.”  It’s gotta be an actual joke.
 
There must be some other examples of Palin/Quayle style humor, but I’m not sure where to look.
 
I keep thinking of Veronica Geng’s hilarious story which includes the line:

<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.

<p>Introduction: Jouni Kerman did a cool bit of research justifying the Beta (1/3, 1/3) prior as noninformative for binomial data, and the Gamma (1/3, 0) prior for Poisson data.
 
You probably thought that nothing new could be said about noninformative priors in such basic problems, but you were wrong!
 
Here’s  the story :
  
The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events. As alternative default conjugate priors, I [Jouni] introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and Gamma(1/3, 0), which I cal</p><p>2 0.99219787 <a title="1479-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-31-Paying_survey_respondents.html">1437 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-31-Paying survey respondents</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  agree  with  Casey Mulligan  that participants in government surveys should be paid, and I think it should be part of the code of ethics for commercial pollsters to compensate their respondents also.
 
As Mulligan points out, if a survey is worth doing, it should be worth compensating the participants for their time and effort.
 
P.S.  Just to clarify, I do  not  recommend that Census surveys be made voluntary, I just think that respondents (who can be required to participate) should be paid a small amount.

<p>Introduction: I have agreed to do a local art exhibition in February. 
 
An excuse to think about form, colour and style for plotting almost individual observation likelihoods – while invoking the artists privilege of refusing to give interpretations of their own work.
 
In order to make it possibly less dry I’ll try to use intuitive suggestive captions like in this example  TheTyranyof13.pdf 
 
thereby side stepping the technical discussions like here  RadfordNealBlog 
 
Suggested models and data sets (or even submissions) would be most appreciated.
 
I likely be sticking to realism i.e. plots that represent ‘statistical reality’ faithfully.

<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>5 0.98381752 <a title="1479-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-30-New_innovations_in_spam.html">545 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-30-New innovations in spam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email today:
  
Hello Andrew,


I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.


Sincerely, 
Samantha Rhodes

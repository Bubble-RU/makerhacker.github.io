<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  quotes  Robin Hanson:
  
If your main reason for talking is to socialize, you’ll want to talk about whatever everyone else is talking about. Like say the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. But if instead your purpose is to gain and spread useful insight, so that we can all understand more about things that matter, you’ll want to look for relatively neglected topics. . . .
  
One advantage of having this blog on a lag of a month or two is that I can post things, knowing that when my discussion finally appears, it will no longer be topical.  Indeed, this post is an example.</p><p>4 0.17325255 <a title="1394-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-07-When_you%E2%80%99re_planning_on_fitting_a_model%2C_build_up_to_it_by_fitting_simpler_models_first.__Then%2C_once_you_have_a_model_you_like%2C_check_the_hell_out_of_it.html">1972 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-07-When you’re planning on fitting a model, build up to it by fitting simpler models first.

<p>Introduction: In response to  my remarks  on his online book, Think Bayes, Allen Downey wrote: 
   
I [Downey] have a question about one of your comments: 
   My [Gelman's] main criticism with both books is that they talk a lot about inference but not so much about model building or model checking (recall the three steps of Bayesian data analysis). I think it’s ok for an introductory book to focus on inference, which of course is central to the data-analytic process—but I’d like them to at least mention that Bayesian ideas arise in model building and model checking as well. 

This sounds like something I agree with, and one of the things I tried to do in the book is to put modeling decisions front and center.  But the word “modeling” is used in lots of ways, so I want to see if we are talking about the same thing.


For example, in many chapters, I start with a simple model of the scenario, do some analysis, then check whether the model is good enough, and iterate.  Here’s the discussion of modeling</p><p>5 0.17154613 <a title="1394-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-13-At_last%2C_treated_with_the_disrespect_that_I_deserve.html">1007 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-13-At last, treated with the disrespect that I deserve</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was at a work-related event today [actually, last month; these non-topical blog entries are on approximately one-month delay], but not connected to the statistics or political science departments.  There were a few people there I knew well, and they were introducing me to others.  Then at some point when I was talking with one of the more important people in the room, a sixtyish guy comes by and stands next to us.  I put out my hand and introduce myself.  He looks at me in puzzlement, spits out his first name, and without a pause starts talking to the person I’d been speaking with.  After about a minute of talk, he walks away, and the important person and I continued our conversation.
 
No big deal . . . but, I have to admit, I haven’t had that experience very often recently.  I’m often at events where I know everyone (or almost everyone) and they know me, and I’m also often at events where I know very few people and have to introduce myself.  But it’s rare to be somewhere where I’m</p><p>6 0.16714817 <a title="1394-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-19-It_is_difficult_to_convey_intonation_in_typed_speech.html">1463 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-19-It is difficult to convey intonation in typed speech</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>4 0.82679909 <a title="1394-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>5 0.79999995 <a title="1394-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-01-Association_for_Psychological_Science_announces_a_new_journal.html">2278 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-01-Association for Psychological Science announces a new journal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Association for Psychological Science, the leading organization of research psychologists, announced a long-awaited new journal,  Speculations on Psychological Science .  From the official APS press release:
  
Speculations on Psychological Science, the flagship journal of the Association for Psychological Science, will publish cutting-edge research articles, short reports, and research reports spanning the entire spectrum of the science of psychology. We anticipate that Speculations on Psychological Science will be the highest ranked empirical journal in psychology. We recognize that many of the most noteworthy published claims in psychology and related fields are not well supported by data, hence the need for a journal for the publication of such exciting speculations without misleading claims of certainty.


- Sigmund Watson, Prof. (Ret.) Miskatonic University, and editor-in-chief, Speculations on Psychological Science

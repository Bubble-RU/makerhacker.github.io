<p>Introduction: In honor of the  Olympics , I got my butt over to the park and played run-around-the-house chess for the first time ever.
 
As was discussed in the comments thread  awhile ago , there seem to be three possible ways to play Turing chess:
 
1.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return.  Once you sit down to the table, the other player runs around the house.  Then you have to move, etc.  You lose if you are checkmated or if you fail to move before your opponent returns to his chair.
 
2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.
 
3.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs.  When you return, yo</p><p>6 0.089993812 <a title="1243-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-31-A_data_visualization_manifesto.html">61 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-31-A data visualization manifesto</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Our apartment is from earlier in the century, so I can’t give Tyler Cowen’s  first answer , but, after that, I follow him in thinking of the several books I have from that decade.  Beyond that, lemme think . . . We occasionally play  Risk , and our set dates from the 50s.  Some kitchen implements (a mixmaster, a couple of cookbooks, who knows which old bowls, forks, etc).  Probably some of the furniture, although I don’t know which.  Probably some of the items in our building (the boiler?)  What else, I wonder?  There are probably a few things I’m forgetting.
 
50-60 years is a long time, I guess.
 
P.S. to the commenters:  I’m taking the question to refer to things manufactured  in  the 1950s and not before!</p><p>4 0.70673448 <a title="1243-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-22-Beach_reads%2C_Proust%2C_and_income_tax.html">103 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-22-Beach reads, Proust, and income tax</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The commenting feature doesn’t work for me on Helen DeWitt’s blog so I’m forced to comment on her entries here.
 
1.  She  discusses  whether it’s fair to characterize  The Last Samurai .  I have a slightly different perspective on this:  I’ve never really understood the idea that a “beach read” should be something light and fluffy.  On the beach, you can relax, you have the time to get into anything.  I could see wanting something light on the subway–you have to be able to get into it right away and follow it amid all the jostles.  I guess the point is that when you’re at the beach, you’re far from the library.  So what you really want for the beach is not necessarily something relaxing or easy to read, but rather a  sure thing , a known quantity that you’ll definitely enjoy.  No point sitting on the beach reading a book that you hate.
 
2.  In an interesting  discussion  of translation, DeWitt recommends learning a language by reading great literature in the original tongue.  Seems f</p><p>5 0.69513696 <a title="1243-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-15-The_it-gets-me-so-angry-I-can%E2%80%99t-deal-with-it_threshold.html">2025 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-15-The it-gets-me-so-angry-I-can’t-deal-with-it threshold</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I happened to be looking at Slate (I know, I know, but I’d already browsed Gawker and I was desperately avoiding doing real work) and came across this  article  by Alice Gregory entitled, “I Read Everything Janet Malcolm Ever Published. I’m in awe of her.”
 
I too think Malcolm is an excellent writer, but (a) I’m not happy that she gets off the hook for  faking quotes , and (b) I’m really really not happy with her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.
 
I just can’t get over that, for some reason.  I can appreciate Picasso’s genius even though he beat his wives or whatever it was he did, I can enjoy the music of Jackson Browne, etc.  But for some reason this Malcolm stuff sticks in my craw.  There’s no deep meaning to this—I recognize it is a somewhat irrational attitude on my part, I just wanted to share it with you.</p><p>6 0.69459897 <a title="1243-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-06-%E2%80%9CAnd_will_pardon_Paul_Claudel%2C_Pardons_him_for_writing_well%E2%80%9D.html">1446 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-06-“And will pardon Paul Claudel, Pardons him for writing well”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My short answer (based on the research of Leighley and Nagler):
  
Whether or not mandatory voting is a good idea, I think it’s unlikely to happen at a national level. Even setting aside the practical difficulties of taking a now-voluntary action and making it compulsory, bringing in the other half of the potential electorate would change the political conversation so much that it’s hard for me to see current officeholders supporting such a plan.

<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.

<p>Introduction: I was invited by the Columbia University residence halls to speak at an event on gay marriage.  (I’ve assisted my colleagues Jeff Lax and Justin Phillips in their research on the topic.)  The event sounded fun–unfortunately I’ll be out of town that weekend so can’t make it–but it got me thinking about how gay marriage and other social issues are so relaxing to think about because there’s no need for doubt.
 
About half of Americans support same-sex marriage and about half oppose it.  And the funny thing is, you can be absolutely certain in your conviction, from either direction.  If you support, it’s a simple matter of human rights, and it’s a bit ridiculous to suppose that if gay marriage is allowed, it will somehow wreck all the straight marriages out there.  Conversely, you can oppose on the clear rationale of wanting to keep marriage the same as it’s always been, and suggest that same-sex couples can be free to get together outside of marriage, as they always could.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to this  interesting article  by Vasik Rajlich and Frederic Friedel.  I find these sorts of things fun to read, but the horrible thing is that I just get worse and worse as a player.  I seem to have lost the ability to automatically filter out the worst moves.  Not that I was ever any good, but now I can’t seem to go five moves without making a major blunder.  I’m seriously thinking about never leaving any pieces unprotected even for a single move, just so I don’t have to worry about forgetting about them.

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>6 0.93410742 <a title="1243-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-28-Colorless_green%2C_and_clueless.html">168 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-28-Colorless green, and clueless</a></p>

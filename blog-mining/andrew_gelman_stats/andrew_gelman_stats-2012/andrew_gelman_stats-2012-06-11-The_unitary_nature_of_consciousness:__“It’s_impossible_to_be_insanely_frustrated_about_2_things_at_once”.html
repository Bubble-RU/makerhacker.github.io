<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>4 0.1072481 <a title="1375-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-01-Post-publication_peer_review%3A__How_it_%28sometimes%29_really_works.html">2004 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-01-Post-publication peer review:  How it (sometimes) really works</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an ideal world, research articles would be open to criticism and discussion in the same place where they are published, in a sort of non-corrupt version of Yelp.  What is happening now is that the occasional paper or research area gets lots of press coverage, and this inspires reactions on science-focused blogs.  The trouble here is that it’s easier to give off-the-cuff comments than detailed criticisms.
 
Here’s an example.  It starts a couple years ago with  this article  by Ryota Kanai, Tom Feilden, Colin Firth, and Geraint Rees, on brain size and political orientation:
  
In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants.

<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>6 0.080214843 <a title="1375-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-How_can_statisticians_help_psychologists_do_their_research_better%3F.html">1860 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-How can statisticians help psychologists do their research better?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>3 0.72041029 <a title="1375-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-23-The_bane_of_many_causes.html">48 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-23-The bane of many causes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the newsflies buzzing around today is an  article   “Brain tumour risk in relation to mobile telephone use: results of the INTERPHONE international case-control study” .
 
The results, shown in this pretty table below, appear to be inconclusive.
 
   
 
A limited amount of cellphone radiation is good for your brain, but not too much? It’s unfortunate that the extremes are truncated. The commentary at  Microwave News  blames bias:
  

The problem with selection bias –also called participation bias– became apparent after the brain tumor risks observed throughout the study were so low as to defy reason. If they reflect reality, they would indicate that cell phones confer immediate protection against tumors. All sides agree that this is extremely unlikely. Further analysis pointed to unanticipated differences between the cases (those with brain tumors) and the controls (the reference group).


The second problem concerns how accurately study participants could recall the amount of t</p><p>4 0.71953052 <a title="1375-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-25-Further_evidence_of_a_longstanding_principle_of_statistics.html">1082 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-25-Further evidence of a longstanding principle of statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The principle  is, Whatever you do, somebody in psychometrics already did it long before.
 
The new evidence comes from an article by Lawrence Hubert and Howard Wainer:
  
There are several issues with the use of ecological correlations: They tend to be a lot higher than individual-level correlations, and assuming what is seen at the group level also holds at the level of the individual is so pernicious, it has been labeled the “ecological fallacy” by Selvin (1958). The term ecological correlation was popularized from a 1950 article by William Robinson (Robinson, 1950), but the idea has been around for some time (e.g., see the 1939 article by E. L. Thorndike, On the Fallacy of Imputing Correlations Found for Groups to the Individuals or Smaller Groups Composing Them).</p><p>5 0.71594357 <a title="1375-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-01-%E2%80%9CThough_They_May_Be_Unaware%2C_Newlyweds_Implicitly_Know_Whether_Their_Marriage_Will_Be_Satisfying%E2%80%9D.html">2156 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-01-“Though They May Be Unaware, Newlyweds Implicitly Know Whether Their Marriage Will Be Satisfying”</a></p>

 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years. We found no correlation between spouses’ automatic and conscious attitu</p><p>6 0.71353322 <a title="1375-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-21-Kahan_on_Pinker_on_politics.html">1633 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-21-Kahan on Pinker on politics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.
 
I’m guessing that the taxi driver quoted above is subject to the same illusions</p><p>2 0.9289397 <a title="1375-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-30-Memorial_Day_question.html">737 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-30-Memorial Day question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89725208 <a title="1375-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-11-The_unitary_nature_of_consciousness%3A__%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s_impossible_to_be_insanely_frustrated_about_2_things_at_once%E2%80%9D.html">1375 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-11-The unitary nature of consciousness:  “It’s impossible to be insanely frustrated about 2 things at once”</a></p>

We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

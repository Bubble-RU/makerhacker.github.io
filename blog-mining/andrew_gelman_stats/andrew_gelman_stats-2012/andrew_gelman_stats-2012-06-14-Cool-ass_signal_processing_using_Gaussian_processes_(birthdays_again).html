<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes with two interesting questions involving time series analysis:
  
 
I used to work in an organization that designed and made signal processing equipment.  Antialiasing and windowing of time series was a big deal in performing analysis accurately.  


Now I’m in a place where I have to make inferences about human-scaled time series.  It has dawned on me that the two are related.  I’m not sure we often have data sampled at a rate at least twice the highest frequency present (not just the highest frequency of interest).  The only articles I’ve seen about aliasing as applied to social science series are from  Hinich  or from  related works .  Box and Jenkins hint at it in section 13.3 of Time Series Analysis, but the analysis seems to be mostly heuristic.  Yet I can imagine all sorts of time series subject to similar problems, from analyses of stock prices based on closing prices (mentioned in the latter article) to other economic series measured on a monthly basis to en</p><p>5 0.12046277 <a title="1379-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-14-GPstuff%3A_Bayesian_Modeling_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">1856 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-14-GPstuff: Bayesian Modeling with Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.
 
Jarno Vanhatalo, Jaakko Riihimäki, Jouni Hartikainen, Pasi Jylänki, Ville Tolvanen, and Aki Vehtari  write :
  
The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year.  It would be easy enough to make.  That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.  While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates.  It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.
 
The data are publicly available, so maybe someone could make those graphs?  If the Valentine’s/Halloween data are worth publishing, I think more comprehensive graphs should be publishable as well.

The data come from the Center for Disease Control and cover the years 1969-1988. Chris also gives instructions for how to download the data and plot them in R from scratch (in 30 lines of R code)!
 
 And now, the background 
 
A few months ago I heard about a study reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days:

<p>Introduction: A few months ago we  reported  on a claim that more babies are born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween.
 
At the time, I wrote that I’d like to see a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.
 
Joshua Gans sent along the following from an unpublished appendix to his paper.  It’s not the graph I was asking for but it does supply additional information beyond those two holidays.  Click to enlarge:
 
   
 
   
 
I don’t know what all those digits are doing (do you really need to know that an estimate is “-70.856″ if its standard error is “10.640″?  I’d think that “-71 +/- 10 would be just fine), but I suppose the careful reader can ignore the numbers and simply read the signs and the stars.  In any case, it’s good to see more data.</p><p>6 0.71264338 <a title="1379-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-19-Happy_birthday.html">2139 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-19-Happy birthday</a></p>

Here’s my version of the  birthday frequency graph . I used Gaussian process with two slowly varying components and periodic component with decay, so that periodic form can change in time. I used Student’s t-distribution as observation model to allow exceptional dates to be outliers. I guess that periodic component due to week effect is still in the data because there is data only from twenty years. Naturally it would be better to model the whole timeseries, but it was easier to just use the cvs by Mulligan.
  
   
 
ALl I can say is . . . wow.  Bayes wins again.  Maybe Aki can supply the R or Matlab code?
 
P.S.  And let’s not forget how great the simple and clear time series plots are, compared to various fancy visualizations that people might try.

Columbus Park is on Chicago’s west side, in the Austin neighborhood. The park is a big green area which includes a golf course.


 Here  is the google satellite view.


 Here  is the nytimes page.  Go to Chicago, and zoom over to the census tract 2521, which is just north of the horizontal gray line (Eisenhower Expressway, aka I290) and just east of Oak Park. The park is labeled on the nytimes map.


The census data have around 50 dots (they say 50 people per dot) in the park which has no residential buildings.


Congressional district is Danny Davis, IL7.   Here’s  a map of the district.


So, how do we explain the map showing ~50 dots worth of people living in the park. What’s up with the algorithm to place the dots?
  
I dunno.  I leave this one to you, the readers.</p><p>4 0.81419015 <a title="1379-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-08-How_adoption_speed_affects_the_abandonment_of_cultural_tastes.html">845 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-08-How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  article  by Jonah Berger and Gael Le Mens:
  
Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-r</p><p>5 0.80347812 <a title="1379-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-17-Rust.html">1538 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-17-Rust</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As announced  earlier , I’ll be putting my Bayesian Data Analysis course on a G+ hangout.  It meets each Friday 8h30 Paris time, starting 18 Oct.
 
Just to try things out, I’ll do a mini-hangout tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30.  What I’ll do is set up the hangout, then post the url in a new blog post.  I’ll then talk for a few minutes.  You should be able to click the url into your browser and see me.
 
If this all works, I’ll do the same thing this Friday 8h30, with a new blog post and a new url.</p><p>3 0.1265443 <a title="1175-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-To_commenters_who_are_trying_to_sell_something.html">839 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-To commenters who are trying to sell something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It seems that every day brings a better system for exploring and sharing data on the Internet. From Iceland comes  DataMarket . DataMarket is very good at visualizing individual datasets – with interaction and animation, although the “market” aspect hasn’t yet been developed, and all access is free.
 
Here’s an example of visualizing rankings of countries competing in WorldCup:
 
   
 
And here’s a lovely example of visualizing  population pyramids :
 
  
  
 
In the future, the visualizations will also include state of the art models for predicting and imputing missing data, and understanding the underlying mechanisms.

<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.

Speaking of strange graphics, http://makingsense.facilitatedsystems.com/2007/03/making-musical-sense-by-email-part-2.html shows an example of text (gnuplot’s dumb terminal) graphics of data from MCSim (code and other material available from http://makingsense.facilitatedsystems.com/2007/03/making-musical-sense-by-email-table-of.html).


 


At another extreme, slide 20 of https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid;=sites&srcid;=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx3c2hhcnJpczEzfGd4OjZkNGFjZWZhOTAyYTFkMDg shows a stereogram of more MCSim output (I was a bit more naive back then).  I included the stereogram as a bit of humor just to show what could be done with J graphics.  Surprisingly, one person in the audience focused intently on that slide and, after a moment, said “Got it!”  We spoke afterwards, and it turned out that he was on the board or at least a volunteer at the Portland (OR) 3D Center of Art & Photography (http://www.3dcenterusa.com/index.html).

<p>Introduction: Jon Goldhill points us to a new search engine,  Zanran , which is for finding data and statistics.  Goldhill writes:
  
It’s useful when you’re looking for a graph/table rather than a single number.  For example, if you look for ‘teenage births rates in the united states’ in Zanran you’ll see a series of graphs.  If you check in Google, there’s plenty of material – but you’d have to open everything up to see if it had any real numbers.  (I hope you’ll appreciate Zanran’s preview capability as well – hovering over the icons gives a useful preview of the content.)</p><p>5 0.75707531 <a title="1175-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-29-FindTheData.org.html">1434 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-29-FindTheData.org</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email: 
  
  
Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>3 0.88335371 <a title="1175-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.
 
I guess what I’m saying is:</p><p>4 0.88102031 <a title="1175-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above is the title of  a talk  that Thad Tarpey gave at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2009.  Here’s the abstract:
  
Students of statistics are often introduced to George Box’s famous quote: “all models are wrong, some are useful.” In this talk I [Tarpey] argue that this quote, although useful, is wrong. A different and more positive perspective is to acknowledge that a model is simply a means of extracting information of interest from data. The truth is infinitely complex and a model is merely an approximation to the truth. If the approximation is poor or misleading, then the model is useless. In this talk I give examples of correct models that are not true models. I illustrate how the notion of a “wrong” model can lead to wrong conclusions.
  
I’m curious what he had to say—maybe he could post the slides?

<p>Introduction: Sander Wagner writes:
  
I just read the post on ethical concerns in medical trials. As there seems to be a lot more pressure on private researchers i thought it might be a nice little exercise to compare p-values from privately funded medical trials with those reported from publicly funded research, to see if confirmation pressure is higher in private research (i.e. p-values are closer to the cutoff levels for significance for the privately funded research). Do you think this is a decent idea or are you sceptical? Also are you aware of any sources listing a large number of representative medical studies and their type of funding?

This sounds like something worth studying.

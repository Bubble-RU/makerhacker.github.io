<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>3 0.12762345 <a title="1403-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-DBQQ_rounding_for_labeling_charts_and_communicating_tolerances.html">939 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-DBQQ rounding for labeling charts and communicating tolerances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a mini research note, not deserving of a paper, but perhaps useful to others. It reinvents what has already  appeared  on this blog.
 
Let’s say we have a line chart with numbers between 152.134 and 210.823, with the mean of 183.463. How should we label the chart with about 3 tics? Perhaps 152.132, 181.4785 and 210.823? Don’t do it!
 
Objective is to fit about 3-7 tics at the optimal level of rounding. I use the following sequence:
  
  decimal rounding : fitting integer  power  and single-digit decimal  i , rounding to  i  * 10^ power  (example: 100 200 300) 
  binary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and binary  b , rounding to 2* i /(1+ b ) * 10^ power  (150 200 250) 
 (optional)  quaternary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and  quaternary  q  (0,1,2,3) round to 4* i /(1+ q ) * 10^ power  (150 175 200) 
  quinary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and  quinary  f  (0,1,2,3,4) round to 5* i /(1+ f ) * 10^ power  (160 180 200)</p><p>4 0.12068781 <a title="1403-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-14-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">2172 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-14-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  a few years ago :
  
 General advice 


Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend rewriting both articles from scratch, using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.


4. Now go back and write the l</p><p>5 0.11733593 <a title="1403-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-14-The_statistics_and_the_science.html">146 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-14-The statistics and the science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  posted  a review of a submitted manuscript where I first wrote that I read the paper only shallowly and then followed up with some suggestions on the statistical analysis, recommending that overdispersion be added to a fitted Posson regression and that the table of regression results be supplemented with a graph showing data and fitted lines.
 
A commenter asked why I wrote such an apparently shallow review, and I realized that some of the implications of my review were not as clear as I’d thought.  So let me clarify.
 
There is a connection between my general reaction and my statistical comments.  My statistical advice here is relevant for (at least) two reasons.  First, a Poisson regression without overdispersion will give nearly-uninterpretable standard errors, which means that I have no sense if the results are statistically significant as claimed.  Second, with a time series plot and regression table, but no graph showing the estimated treatment effect, it is very dif</p><p>6 0.11111827 <a title="1403-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-07-Bayesian_hierarchical_model_for_the_prediction_of_soccer_results.html">20 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-07-Bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of soccer results</a></p>

One of my colleagues suggested that I send you  this very short note  that I wrote on a new approach for displaying regression result uncertainty (attached). It’s very simple, and I’ve found it effective in one of my papers where I actually use it, but if you have a chance to glance over it and have any ideas for how to sell the approach or make it better, I’d be very interested to hear them. (Also, if you’ve seen that someone else has already made this point, I’d appreciate knowing that too.)
  
Here’s an example:

Solomon wrote: 
  
  
The matlab and stata functions I wrote, as well as the script that replicates my figures, are all posted on  my website .


Also, I just added options to the main matlab function (vwregress.m) to make it display the spaghetti plot (similar to what Lucas did, but a simple bootstrap) and the shaded CI that you suggested (see figs below). They’re good suggestions.


   


   


Personally, I [Hsiang] like the shaded CI better, since I think that all the visual activity in the spaghetti plot is a little distracting and sometimes adds visual weight in places where I wouldn’t want it.  But the option is there in case people like it.
  
Solomon then followed up with:

<p>Introduction: Tables are commonly read as crude graphs: what you notice in a table of numbers is (a) the minus signs, and thus which values are positive and which are negative, and (b) the length of each number, that is, its order of magnitude. The most famous example of such a read might be when the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan supposedly conjectured the asymptotic form of the partition function based on a look at a table of the first several partition numbers: he was essentially looking at a graph on the logarithmic scale.

 This  report claims that eating meat increases the risk of cancer.  I’m sure you can’t read the page but you probably can understand the graphs. Different bars represent subdivision in the amount of the particular type of meat one consumes. And each chunk is different types of meat. Left is for male right is for female.


They claim that the difference is significant, but they are clearly not!!


I’m for not eating much meat but this is just way too much…
  
Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
I don’t know what to think.  If you look carefully you can find one or two statistically significant differences but overall the pattern doesn’t look so compelling.  I don’t know what the top and bottom rows are, though.  Overall, the pattern in the top row looks like it could represent a real trend, while the graphs on the bottom row look like noise.

<p>Introduction: I was at a talk awhile ago where the speaker presented tables with 4, 5, 6, even 8 significant digits even though, as is usual, only the first or second digit of each number conveyed any useful information.  A graph would be better, but even if you’re too lazy to make a plot, a bit of rounding would seem to be required.
 
I mentioned this to a colleague, who responded:
  
I don’t know how to stop this practice.  Logic doesn’t work.  Maybe ridicule?  Best hope is the departure from field who do it.  (Theories don’t die, but the people who follow those theories retire.)
  
Another possibility, I think, is helpful software defaults.  If we can get to the people who write the software, maybe we could have some impact.
 
Once the software is written, however, it’s probably too late.  I’m not far from the center of the R universe, but I don’t know if I’ll ever succeed in my goals of increasing the default number of histogram bars or reducing the default number of decimal places in regression</p><p>2 0.95771956 <a title="1403-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-12-Get_the_Data.html">569 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-12-Get the Data</a></p>

My pipe dream is to create a taxonomy of variables and instances, and collect spreadsheets annotated this way. Imagine doing a search of type: “give me datasets, where an instance is a person, the variables are age, gender and weight” – and out would come datasets, each one tagged with the descriptions of the variables that were held constant for the whole dataset (person_type=student, location=Columbia, time_of_study=1/1/2009, study_type=longitudinal). It would even be possible to automatically convert one variable into another, if it was necessary (like age = time_of_measurement-time_of_birth). Maybe the dream of  Semantic Web  will actually be implemented for relatively structured statistical data rather than much fuzzier “knowledge”, just consider the difficulties of developing a universal  Freebase .

I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.22122656 <a title="1275-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>5 0.194161 <a title="1275-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-25-Apply_now_for_Earth_Institute_postdoctoral_fellowships_at_Columbia_University.html">971 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-25-Apply now for Earth Institute postdoctoral fellowships at Columbia University</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The economy isn’t going so well, but there are some interesting possibilities here at Columbia University.  One such option that you should be thinking about is the  Earth Institute Fellowship , which pays well, includes a research stipend, and puts you in an exciting interdisciplinary community of faculty and postdoctoral researchers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia brings in several postdocs each year–it’s a two-year gig–and some of them have been statisticians (recently, Kenny Shirley and Leontine Alkema).  We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health.  It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.  The EI postdoc can be a place to do interesting work and begin a research career.
 
If you’re a statistician who’s interested in this fellowship, feel free to contact me directly–you have to apply to the Earth Institute directly (see link above), but I’m happy to give you advice about</p><p>6 0.15991428 <a title="1275-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-22-Postdoc_opportunity_here_at_Columbia_%E2%80%94_deadline_soon%21.html">426 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-22-Postdoc opportunity here at Columbia — deadline soon!</a></p>

I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.

<p>Introduction: Curt Yeske pointed me to  this .  Wow–these graphs are really hard to read!
 
The old me would’ve said that each of these graphs would be better replaced by a dotplot (or, better still, a series of lineplots showing time trends).
 
The new me would still like the dotplots and lineplots, but I’d say it’s fine to have the eye-grabbing but hard-to-read graphs as is, and then to have the more informative statistical graphics underneath, as it were.  The idea is, you’d click on the pretty but hard-to-read “infovis” graphs, and this would then reveal informative “full Cleveland” graphs.  And then if you click again you’d get a spreadsheet with the raw numbers.

<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.  In political science, the usual way to start is</p><p>same-blog 3 0.93881369 <a title="1275-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice. The breadth of vN’s work is just too m</p><p>6 0.92204797 <a title="1275-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-26-%E2%80%9CA_Vast_Graveyard_of_Undead_Theories%3A__Publication_Bias_and_Psychological_Science%E2%80%99s_Aversion_to_the_Null%E2%80%9D.html">1826 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-26-“A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories:  Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null”</a></p>

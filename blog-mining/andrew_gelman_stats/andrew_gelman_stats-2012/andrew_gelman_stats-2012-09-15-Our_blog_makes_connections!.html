<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .

I’m a former undergrad machine learning student and a current software engineer with a Bayesian hobby. Today my two worlds collided. I ask for some enlightenment.


On your blog you’ve repeatedly advocated continuous distributions with Bayesian models. Today I read  this article  by Ricky Ho, who writes:

 
The strength of Bayesian network is it is highly scalable and can learn incrementally because all we do is to count the observed variables and update the probability distribution table. Similar to Neural Network, Bayesian network expects all data to be binary, categorical variable will need to be transformed into multiple binary variable as described above. Numeric variable is generally not a good fit for Bayesian network.
 

The last sentence seems to be at odds with what you’ve said. Sadly, I don’t have enough expertise to say which view of the world is correct.

My reply:  Iâ&euro;&trade;m not up-to-date on the Bayesian econometrics literature.  TTony Lancaster came out with a book a few years ago that might have some of these models.

Thank you for fulfilling another request of mine almost two years ago. I gave you a job description of a senior Bayesian statistical software developer that I was loooking to hire.  You kindly  posted it  on your site.


THAT EVENING, I received a response from a fellow in Florida who had worked as a C++ programmer for 10+ years and — inexplicably — was now finishing his PhD in Bayesian econometrics.  We hired him and he has done magical things with our software, making estimating hierarchical Bayesian models in “real time” on very large, complex datasets a reality.  He’s a super guy, to boot!  Together with others on our staff, we now have fully parallelized versions of most econometric models working on over 100 cores.  (You may have read a paper by one of my partners, Prof John Liechty at Penn State, on parallel slicer samplers).</p><p>2 0.93945098 <a title="1497-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-Multiple_comparisons_dispute_in_the_tabloids.html">1195 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-Multiple comparisons dispute in the tabloids</a></p>

I’m probably not the first to point this out, but just in case, you might be interested in this   article  by T. Florian Jaeger, Daniel Pontillo, and Peter Graff on a statistical dispute [regarding the claim, "Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa"].


Seems directly relevant to your article on multiple hypothesis testing and associated talk at the Voodoo correlations meeting.  Curious to know your thoughts on this if you think it’s blog-worthy.
  
Here’s the abstract of the paper:
  
Atkinson (Reports, 15 April 2011, p. 346) argues that the phonological complexity of languages reflects the loss of phonemic distinctions due to successive founder events during human migration (the serial founder hypothesis). Statistical simulations show that the type I error rate of Atkinson’s analysis is hugely inflated. The data at best support only a weak interpretation of the serial founder hypothesis.

<p>Introduction: Jarad Niemi sends along this plot:
 
 
 
and writes:
  
2010-2011 Miami Heat offensive (red), defensive (blue), and combined (black) player contribution means (dots) and 95% credible intervals (lines) where zero indicates an average NBA player. Larger positive numbers for offensive and combined are better while larger negative numbers for defense are better.


In retrospect, I [Niemi] should have plotted -1*defensive_contribution so that larger was always better. The main point with this figure is that this awesome combination of James-Wade-Bosh that was discussed immediately after the LeBron trade to the Heat has a one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other aspect. At least according to my analysis, Bosh is hurting his team compared to the average player (although not statistically significant) due to his terrible defensive contribution (which is statistically significant).
  
All fine so far.  But the punchline comes at the end, when he writes:

<p>Introduction: I opened the newspaper today (recall that this blog is on an approximately one-month delay) to see a moderately horrifying  story  about art appraisers who are deterred by fear of lawsuits from expressing an opinion about possible forgeries.
 
Maybe this trend will come to science too?  Perhaps Brett Pelham will sue Uri Simonsohn for the pain, suffering, and loss of income occurring from the  questioning of his Dennis the dentist paper ?  Or maybe I’ll be sued by some rogue sociologist for publicly questioning his data dredging?
 
Anyway, what amused me about the NYT article on art forgery was that two of the artists featured in the discussion were . . . Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein!  Warhol is famous for diluting the notion of the unique art object and for making works of art in a “Factory,” and Lichtenstein is famous for ripping off the style and imagery of comic book artists.  It’s funny for the two of them, of all people, to come up in a discussion of authenticity.

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

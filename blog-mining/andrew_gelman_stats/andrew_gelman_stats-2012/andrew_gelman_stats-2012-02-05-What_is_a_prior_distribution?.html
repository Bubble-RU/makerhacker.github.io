<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

While I am absolutely sympathetic to the Bayesian agenda I am often troubled by the requirement of having priors. We must have priors on the parameter of an infinite number of model we have never seen before and I find this troubling. There is a similarly troubling problem in economics of utility theory. Utility is on consumables. To be complete a consumer must assign utility to all sorts of things they never would have encountered. More recent versions of utility theory instead make consumption goods a portfolio of attributes. Cadillacs are x many units of luxury y of transport etc etc. And we can automatically have personal utilities to all these attributes.  


I don’t ever see parameters. Some model have few and some have hundreds. Instead, I see data. So I don’t know how to have an opinion on parameters themselves. Rather I think it far more natural to have opinions on the behavior of models. The prior predictive density is a good and sensible notion.

<p>Introduction: Following up on Christian’s  post  [link fixed] on the topic, I’d like to offer a few thoughts of my own.
 
In BDA, we express the idea that a noninformative prior is a placeholder:  you can use the noninformative prior to get the analysis started, then if your posterior distribution is less informative than you would like, or if it does not make sense, you can go back and add prior information.
 
Same thing for the data model (the “likelihood”), for that matter:  it often makes sense to start with something simple and conventional and then go from there.
 
So, in that sense, noninformative priors are no big deal, they’re just a way to get started.  Just don’t take them too seriously.
 
Traditionally in statistics we’ve worked with the paradigm of a single highly informative dataset with only weak external information.  But if the data are sparse and prior information is strong, we have to think differently.  And, when you increase the dimensionality of a problem, both these things hap</p><p>5 0.36922777 <a title="1155-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-05-Prior_distribution_for_a_predicted_probability.html">2200 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-05-Prior distribution for a predicted probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
I have an interesting thought on a prior for a logistic regression, and would love your input on how to make it “work.”


Some of my research, two published papers, are on mathematical models of **.  Along those lines, I’m interested in developing more models for **. . . .  Empirical studies show that the public is rather smart and that the wisdom-of-the-crowd is fairly accurate.


So, my thought would be to tread the public’s probability of the event as a prior, and then see how adding data, through a model, would change or perturb our inferred probability of **.  (Similarly, I could envision using previously published epidemiological research as a prior probability of a disease, and then seeing how the addition of new testing protocols would update that belief.)


However, everything I learned about hierarchical Bayesian models has a prior as a distribution on the coefficients.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo sent me  this quote  from Jim Berger:
  
Too often I see people pretending to be subjectivists, and then using “weakly informative” priors that the objective Bayesian community knows are terrible and will give ridiculous answers; subjectivism is then being used as a shield to hide ignorance. . . . In my own more provocative moments, I claim that the only true subjectivists are the objective Bayesians, because they refuse to use subjectivism as a shield against criticism of sloppy pseudo-Bayesian practice.
  
This caught my attention because I’ve become more and more convinced that weakly informative priors are  the right way to go  in many different situations.  I don’t think Berger was talking about  me , though, as the above quote came from a publication in 2006, at which time I’d only started writing about weakly informative priors.
 
Going back to Berger’s  article , I see that his “weakly informative priors” remark was aimed at  this article  by Anthony O’Hagan, who w</p><p>4 0.89945281 <a title="1155-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-15-Reputations_changeable%2C_situations_tolerable.html">1858 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-15-Reputations changeable, situations tolerable</a></p>

Marginally specified priors for nonparametric Bayesian estimation


Prior specification for nonparametric Bayesian inference involves the difficult task of quantifying prior knowledge about a parameter of high, often infinite, dimension. Realistically, a statistician is unlikely to have informed opinions about all aspects of such a parameter, but may have real information about functionals of the parameter, such the population mean or variance. This article proposes a new framework for nonparametric Bayes inference in which the prior distribution for a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter is decomposed into two parts: an informative prior on a finite set of functionals, and a nonparametric conditional prior for the parameter given the functionals. Such priors can be easily constructed from standard nonparametric prior distributions in common use, and inherit the large support of the standard priors upon which they are based.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had a couple of email conversations in the past couple days on dependence in multivariate prior distributions.
 
 Modeling the degrees of freedom and scale parameters in the t distribution 
 
First, in our Stan group we’ve been discussing the choice of priors for the degrees-of-freedom parameter in the t distribution.  I wrote that also there’s the question of parameterization.  It does not necessarily make sense to have independent priors on the df and scale parameters.  In some sense, the meaning of the scale parameter changes with the df.
 
 Prior dependence between correlation and scale parameters in the scaled inverse-Wishart model 
 
The second case of parameterization in prior distribution arose from an email I received from Chris Chatham pointing me to  this exploration  by Matt Simpson of the scaled inverse-Wishart prior distribution for hierarchical covariance matrices.  Simpson writes:

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog discussion revealed some confusion that I’ll try to resolve here.
 
I  wrote  that I’m not a big fan of subjective priors.  Various commenters had difficulty with this point, and I think the issue was most clearly stated by Bill Jeff re erys, who  wrote :
  
It seems to me that your prior has to reflect your subjective information before you look at the data. How can it not?


But this does not mean that the (subjective) prior that you choose is irrefutable; Surely a prior that reflects prior information just does not have to be inconsistent with that information. But that still leaves a range of priors that are consistent with it, the sort of priors that one would use in a sensitivity analysis, for example.
  
I think I see what Bill is getting at.  A prior represents your subjective belief, or some approximation to your subjective belief, even if it’s not perfect.  That sounds reasonable but I don’t think it works.  Or, at least, it often doesn’t work.

<p>Introduction: Pointing to this  news article  by Megan McArdle discussing a recent study of Medicaid recipients, Jonathan Falk writes:
  
Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.

A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  from David Gorski (which I found via  this  link from Joseph Delaney).
 
I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.  It’s only n=1 and adds almost nothing to the literature on the effectiveness of various treatments, but a story like this can help focus one’s thoughts on the decision problems.</p><p>4 0.9735139 <a title="1155-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>5 0.97334969 <a title="1155-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic_screening_to_get_an_approximate_self-weighted_sample.html">1455 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic screening to get an approximate self-weighted sample</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharad had a survey sampling question:
  
We’re trying to use mechanical turk to conduct some surveys, and have quickly discovered that turkers tend to be quite young. We’d really like a representative sample of the U.S., or at the least be able to recruit a diverse enough sample from turk that we can post-stratify to adjust the estimates. The approach we ended up taking is to pay turkers a small amount to answer a couple of screening questions (age & sex), and then probabilistically recruit individuals to complete the full survey (for more money) based on the estimated turk population parameters and our desired target distribution. We use rejection sampling, so the end result is that individuals who are invited to take the full survey look as if they came from a representative sample, at least in terms of age and sex. I’m wondering whether this sort of technique—a two step design in which participants are first screened and then probabilistically selected to mimic a target distributio</p><p>6 0.97242689 <a title="1155-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-24-Latest_in_blog_advertising.html">1080 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-24-Latest in blog advertising</a></p>

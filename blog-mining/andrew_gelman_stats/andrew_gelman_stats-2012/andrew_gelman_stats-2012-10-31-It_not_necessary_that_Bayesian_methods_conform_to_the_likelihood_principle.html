<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>3 0.24512257 <a title="1554-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Yes%2C_checking_calibration_of_probability_forecasts_is_part_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">1610 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics.  At the end of this post are three figures from Chapter 1 of Bayesian Data Analysis illustrating empirical evaluation of forecasts.
 
But first the background.  Why am I bringing this up now?  It’s because of something Larry Wasserman  wrote the other day : 
  
  
One of the striking facts about [baseball/political forecaster Nate Silver's recent] book is the emphasis the Silver places on frequency calibration. . . . Have no doubt about it: Nate Silver is a frequentist. For example, he says:

 
One of the most important tests of a forecast — I would argue that it is the single most important one — is called calibration. Out of all the times you said there was a 40 percent chance of rain, how often did rain actually occur? If over the long run, it really did rain about 40 percent of the time, that means your forecasts were well calibrated.

<p>Introduction: Charlie Williams writes:
  
As I get interested in Bayesian approaches to statistics, I have one question I wondered if you would find interesting to address at some point on the blog.


What does Bayesian work look like in action across a field? From experience, I have some feeling for how ongoing debates evolve (or not) with subsequent studies in response to earlier findings. I wonder if you know how this happens in practice when multiple researchers are using Bayesian approaches. How much are previous findings built into priors? How much advance comes from model improvement? And in a social science field where self-selection and self-interest play a role, how are improved “treatment” effects incorporated and evaluated?


I thought you might know of a field where actual back and forth has been carried out mostly in the context of Bayesian analysis or inference, and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at an example as I think about my own field.

<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo recommended that I consider coming up with a new name for the statistical methods that I used, given that the term “Bayesian” has all sorts of associations that I dislike (as discussed, for example, in section 1 of  this article ).
 
I replied that I agree on Bayesian, I never liked the term and always wanted something better, but I couldn’t think of any convenient alternative.  Also, I was finding that Bayesians (even the Bayesians I disagreed with) were reading my research articles, while non-Bayesians were simply ignoring them.  So I thought it was best to identify with, and communicate with, those people who were willing to engage with me.
 
More formally, I’m happy defining “Bayesian” as “using inference from the posterior distribution, p(theta|y)”.  This says nothing about where the probability distributions come from (thus, no requirement to be “subjective” or “objective”) and it says nothing about the models (thus, no requirement to use the discrete models that hav</p><p>4 0.87914747 <a title="1554-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Yes%2C_checking_calibration_of_probability_forecasts_is_part_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">1610 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.  It’s just that he’s fighting against a bu</p><p>6 0.86978847 <a title="1554-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-11-Bayes_in_the_research_conversation.html">2368 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-11-Bayes in the research conversation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This video caught my interest –  news video clip   
(from this 
 post2 )
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/02/on_summarizing.html
 
The news commentator did seem to be trying to point out what a couple of states had to say about the claimed relationship – almost on their own. 
 
Some  methods  have been worked out for zombies to do just this!
 
So I grabbed the data as close as I quickly could, modified the code slightly and here’s the zombie veiw of it.
 
 PoliticInt.pdf 
 
North Carolina is the bolded red curve, Idaho the bolded green curve. 
Missisipi and New York are the bolded blue.
 
As ugly as it is this is the Bayasian marginal picture – exactly (given MCMC errror).
 
K? 
p.s. you will get a very confusing picture if you forget to centre the x (i.e. see chapter 4 of Gelman and Hill book)</p><p>2 0.95688206 <a title="1554-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-17-Joanne_Gowa_scooped_me_by_22_years_in_my_criticism_of_Axelrod%E2%80%99s_Evolution_of_Cooperation.html">348 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-17-Joanne Gowa scooped me by 22 years in my criticism of Axelrod’s Evolution of Cooperation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bayesian inference, conditional on the model and data, conforms to the likelihood principle. But there is more to Bayesian methods than Bayesian inference. See chapters 6 and 7 of Bayesian Data Analysis for much discussion of this point.
 
It saddens me to see that people are still  confused  on this issue.</p><p>4 0.95446742 <a title="1554-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-11-%E2%80%9CWhat_should_you_talk_about%3F%E2%80%9D.html">2329 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-11-“What should you talk about?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  quotes  Robin Hanson:
  
If your main reason for talking is to socialize, you’ll want to talk about whatever everyone else is talking about. Like say the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. But if instead your purpose is to gain and spread useful insight, so that we can all understand more about things that matter, you’ll want to look for relatively neglected topics. . . .
  
One advantage of having this blog on a lag of a month or two is that I can post things, knowing that when my discussion finally appears, it will no longer be topical.  Indeed, this post is an example.</p><p>5 0.94428915 <a title="1554-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-21-People_kept_emailing_me_this_one_so_I_think_I_have_to_blog_something.html">725 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-21-People kept emailing me this one so I think I have to blog something</a></p>

I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.  That could be fine—after all, Hastie is a distinguished psychology researcher—but I wasn’t so clear that he’s so clear on what he’s saying.  For example:

<p>Introduction: According to the  National Weather Service :
  
What is a 100 year flood?  A 100 year flood is an event that statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. A 500 year flood has a .2% chance of occurring and a 1000 year flood has a .1% chance of occurring.
  
The accompanying map shows a part of Tennessee that in May 2010 had 1000-year levels of flooding.
 
 
 
At first, it seems hard to believe that a 1000-year flood would have just happened to occur last year.  But then, this is just a 1000-year flood for that particular place.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t really have a sense of the statistics of these events.  How many 100-year, 500-year, and 1000-year flood events have been recorded by the Weather Service, and when have they occurred?</p><p>4 0.14201261 <a title="1319-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-18-Tibshirani_announces_new_research_result%3A__A_significance_test_for_the_lasso.html">1769 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-18-Tibshirani announces new research result:  A significance test for the lasso</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lasso and me 
 
For a long time I was wrong about lasso.
 
Lasso (“least absolute shrinkage and selection operator”) is a regularization procedure that shrinks regression coefficients toward zero, and in its basic form is equivalent to maximum penalized likelihood estimation with a penalty function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients.
 
I first heard about lasso from a talk that  Trevor Hastie  Rob Tibshirani gave at Berkeley in 1994 or 1995.  He demonstrated that it shrunk regression coefficients to zero.  I wasn’t impressed, first because it seemed like no big deal (if that’s the prior you use, that’s the shrinkage you get) and second because, from a Bayesian perspective, I don’t  want  to shrink things all the way to zero.  In the sorts of social and environmental science problems I’ve worked on, just about nothing is zero.  I’d like to control my noisy estimates but there’s nothing special about zero.  At the end of the talk I stood</p><p>5 0.14021757 <a title="1319-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-16-Whither_the_%E2%80%9Cbet_on_sparsity_principle%E2%80%9D_in_a_nonsparse_world%3F.html">2136 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-16-Whither the “bet on sparsity principle” in a nonsparse world?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rob Tibshirani  writes :
  
Hastie et al. (2001) coined the informal “Bet on Sparsity” principle. The l1 methods assume that the truth is sparse, in some basis. If the assumption holds true, then the parameters can be efficiently estimated using l1 penalties. If the assumption does not hold—so that the truth is dense—then no method will be able to recover the underlying model without a large amount of data per parameter.
  
I’ve earlier  expressed  my full and sincere appreciation for Hastie and Tibshirani’s work in this area.
 
Now I’d like to briefly comment on the above snippet.  The question is, how do we think about the “bet on sparsity” principle in a world where the truth  is  dense?  I’m thinking here of social science, where no effects are clean and no coefficient is zero (see page 960 of  this article  or various blog discussions in the past few years), where every contrast is meaningful—but some of these contrasts might be lost in the noise with any realistic size of data.</p><p>6 0.12498759 <a title="1319-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  amusing-yet-so-true video directed by Eléonore Pourriat shows a sex-role-reversed world where women are in charge and men don’t get taken seriously.  It’s convincing and affecting, but the twist that interests me comes at the end, when the real world returns.  It’s really creepy.
 
And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat’s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don’t think would’ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.
 
The point here is that the real world is indeed what is real.  This alternative sex-role-reversed world is not actually possible, and what makes it interesting to think about is the contrast to what really is.

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.  When learning science, we sometimes speak</p><p>5 0.77597034 <a title="1319-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-18-The_treatment%2C_the_intermediate_outcome%2C_and_the_ultimate_outcome%3A__Leverage_and_the_financial_crisis.html">1420 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-18-The treatment, the intermediate outcome, and the ultimate outcome:  Leverage and the financial crisis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Huberman points to an article on the financial crisis by Bethany McLean, who  writes :
  
lthough our understanding of what instigated the 2008 global financial crisis remains at best incomplete, there are a few widely agreed upon contributing factors. One of them is a 2004 rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allowed investment banks to load up on leverage.


This disastrous decision has been cited by a host of prominent economists, including Princeton professor and former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Alan Blinder and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. It has even been immortalized in Hollywood, figuring into the dark financial narrative that propelled the Academy Award-winning film Inside Job. . . .


Here’s just one problem with this story line: It’s not true. Nor is it hard to prove that. Look at the historical leverage of the big five investment banks — Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

<p>Introduction: I encountered this  news article , “Chicago school bans some lunches brought from home”:
  
At Little Village, most students must take the meals served in the cafeteria or go hungry or both. . . . students are not allowed to pack lunches from home. Unless they have a medical excuse, they must eat the food served in the cafeteria. . . . Such discussions over school lunches and healthy eating echo a larger national debate about the role government should play in individual food choices.  “This is such a fundamental infringement on parental responsibility,” said J. Justin Wilson, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Center for Consumer Freedom, which is partially funded by the food industry. . . . For many CPS parents, the idea of forbidding home-packed lunches would be unthinkable. . . . 
  
If I had read this two years ago, I’d be at one with J. Justin Wilson and the outraged kids and parents.  But last year we spent a sabbatical in Paris, where . . . kids aren’t allowed to bring</p><p>2 0.95379794 <a title="1319-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-22-Researching_the_cost-effectiveness_of_political_lobbying_organisations.html">969 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-22-Researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.

<p>Introduction: Much-honored playwright Tony Kushner was set to receive one more honor–a degree from John Jay College–but it was suddenly  taken away  from him on an 11-1 vote of the trustees  of the City University of New York.  This was the first rejection of an honorary degree nomination since 1961.
 
The news article focuses on one trustee, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment adviser and onetime political aide, who opposed Kushner’s honorary degree, but to me the relevant point is that the committee as a whole voted 11-1 to ding him.
 
Kusnher said, “I’m sickened,” he added, “that this is happening in New York City. Shocked, really.”  I can see why he’s shocked, but perhaps it’s not so surprising that it’s happening in NYC.  Recall the famous incident from 1940 in which Bertrand Russell was invited and then uninvited to teach at City College.  The problem that time was Russell’s views on free love (as they called it back then).  There seems to be a long tradition of city college officials being will</p><p>4 0.95133591 <a title="1319-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-07-The_red-state%2C_blue-state_war_is_happening_in_the_upper_half_of_the_income_distribution.html">456 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-07-The red-state, blue-state war is happening in the upper half of the income distribution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As we said in Red State, Blue State, it’s not the Prius vs. the pickup truck, it’s the Prius vs. the Hummer.  Here’s the graph:
 
 
 
Or, as Ross Douthat put it in  an op-ed  yesterday:
  
This means that a culture war that’s often seen as a clash between liberal elites and a conservative middle America looks more and more like a conflict within the educated class — pitting Wheaton and Baylor against Brown and Bard, Redeemer Presbyterian Church against the 92nd Street Y, C. S. Lewis devotees against the Philip Pullman fan club.
  
Our main motivation for doing this work was to change how the news media think about America’s political divisions, and so it’s good to see our ideas getting mainstreamed and moving toward conventional wisdom.
  

 
P.S.  Here’s the time series of graphs showing how the pattern that we and Douthat noticed, of a battle between coastal states and middle America that is occurring among upper-income Americans, is relatively recent, having arisen in the Clinton ye</p><p>same-blog 5 0.94342768 <a title="1319-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-14-I_hate_to_get_all_Gerd_Gigerenzer_on_you_here%2C_but_._._..html">1319 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-14-I hate to get all Gerd Gigerenzer on you here, but . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor points me to an  opinion piece  by psychologist Reid Hastie, “Our Gift for Good Stories Blinds Us to the Truth.”
 
I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.  That could be fine—after all, Hastie is a distinguished psychology researcher—but I wasn’t so clear that he’s so clear on what he’s saying.  For example:
  
The human brain is designed to support two modes of thought: visual and narrative. These forms of thinking are universal across human societies throughout history, develop reliably early in individuals’ lives</p><p>6 0.93808955 <a title="1319-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-20-Maybe_a_great_idea_in_theory%2C_didn%E2%80%99t_work_so_well_in_practice.html">621 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-20-Maybe a great idea in theory, didn’t work so well in practice</a></p>

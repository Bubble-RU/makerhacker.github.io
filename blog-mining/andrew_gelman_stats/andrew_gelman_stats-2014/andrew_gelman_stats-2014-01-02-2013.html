<p>Introduction: The talk  is at the University of Amsterdam in the Diamantbeurs (Weesperplein 4, Amsterdam), room 5.01, at noon.
 
Here’s the plan:
  
Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?


In recent years, psychology and medicine have been rocked by scandals of research fraud. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of serious flaws in the general practices of statistics for scientific research, to the extent that top journals routinely publish claims that are implausible and cannot be replicated. All this is occurring despite (or perhaps because of?) statistical tools such as Type 1 error control that are supposed to restrict the rate of unreliable claims. We consider ways in which prior information and Bayesian methods might help resolve these problems.

<p>Introduction: From August 1990.  It was in the form of a note sent to all the people in the statistics group of Bell Labs, where I’d worked that summer.
  
To all:


Here’s the abstract of the work I’ve done this summer.  It’s stored in the file, 
/fs5/gelman/abstract.bell, and copies of the Figures 1-3 are on Trevor’s desk. 
Any comments are of course appreciated; I’m at gelman@stat.berkeley.edu.


On the Routine Use of Markov Chains for Simulation

1.  Simulation


In probability and statistics we can often specify multivariate distributions 
many of whose properties we do not fully understand–perhaps, as in the 
Ising model of statistical physics, we can write the joint density function, up 
to a multiplicative constant that cannot be expressed in closed form. 
For an example in statistics, consider the Normal random 
effects model in the analysis of variance, which can be 
easily placed in a Bayesian fram</p><p>6 0.17878067 <a title="2157-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics_%28with_all_the_discussions%21%29.html">1712 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (with all the discussions!)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was given the opportunity to briefly comment on the  paper , A Bayesian approach to complex clinical diagnoses: a case-study in child abuse, by Nicky Best, Deborah Ashby, Frank Dunstan, David Foreman, and Neil McIntosh, for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.  Here is what I wrote:
  
Best et al. are working on an important applied problem and I have no reason to doubt that their approach is a step forward beyond diagnostic criteria based on point estimation.  An attempt at an accurate assessment of variation is important not just for statistical reasons but also because scientists have the duty to convey their uncertainty to the larger world.  I am thinking, for example, of discredited claims such as that of the mathematician who claimed to predict divorces with 93% accuracy (Abraham, 2010).


Regarding the paper at hand, I thought I would try an experiment in comment-writing.

<p>Introduction: The talk  is at the University of Amsterdam in the Diamantbeurs (Weesperplein 4, Amsterdam), room 5.01, at noon.
 
Here’s the plan:
  
Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?


In recent years, psychology and medicine have been rocked by scandals of research fraud. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of serious flaws in the general practices of statistics for scientific research, to the extent that top journals routinely publish claims that are implausible and cannot be replicated. All this is occurring despite (or perhaps because of?) statistical tools such as Type 1 error control that are supposed to restrict the rate of unreliable claims. We consider ways in which prior information and Bayesian methods might help resolve these problems.
  
I don’t know how organized this talk will be. It combines a bunch of ideas that have been floating around recently. Here are a few recent articles that</p><p>3 0.95356464 <a title="2157-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-07-Analysis_of_Power_Law_of_Participation.html">946 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-07-Analysis of Power Law of Participation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rick Wash writes:
  
A colleague as USC (Lian Jian) and I  were recently discussing a statistical analysis issue that both of us have run into recently.


We both mostly do research about how people use online interactive websites.  One property that most of these systems have is known as the “powerlaw of participation” — the distribution of the number of contributions from each person follows a powerlaw.  This mean that a few people contribution a TON and many, many people are in the “long tail” and contribute very rarely.   For example, Facebook posts and twitter posts both have this distribution, as do comments on blogs and many other forms of user contribution online.


This distribution has proven to be a problem when we analyze individual behavior.  The basic problem is that we’d like to account for the fact that we have repeated data from many users, but a large number of users only have 1 or 2 data points.   For example, Lian

<p>Introduction: In response to the latest  controversy , a statistics professor writes:
  
It’s somewhat surprising to see Very Serious Researchers (apologies to Paul Krugman) using Excel.  Some years ago, I was consulting on a trademark infringement case and was trying (unsuccessfully) to replicate another expert’s regression analysis.  It wasn’t until I had the brainstorm to use Excel that I was able to reproduce his results – it may be better now, but at the time, Excel could propagate round-off error and catastrophically cancel like no other software!
  
Microsoft has lots of top researchers so it’s hard for me to understand how Excel can remain so crappy.  I mean, sure, I understand in some general way that they have a large user base, it’s hard to maintain backward compatibility, there’s feature creep, and, besides all that, lots of people have different preferences in data analysis than I do.  But still, it’s such a joke.

<p>Introduction: Marty McKee at Wolfram Research appears to have a very very stupid colleague.  McKee  wrote  to Christian Robert:
  
Your article, “Evidence and Evolution: A review”, caught the attention of one of my colleagues, who thought that it could be developed into an interesting Demonstration to add to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.
  
As Christian points out, adapting his book review into a computer demonstration would be quite a feat!  I wonder what McKee’s colleague could be thinking?  I recommend that Wolfram fire McKee’s colleague immediately:  what an idiot!
 
P.S.  I’m not actually sure that McKee was the author of this email; I’m guessing this was the case because this other  very similar  email was written under his name.
 
P.P.S.  To head off the inevitable comments:  Yes, yes, I know this is no big deal and I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it.  But . . .

<p>Introduction: 27. Which of the following problems were identified with the Burnham et al. survey of Iraq mortality? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) The survey used cluster sampling, which is inappropriate for estimating individual out- comes such as death.
 
(b) In their report, Burnham et al. did not identify their primary sampling units.
 
(c) The second-stage sampling was not a probability sample.
 
(d) Survey materials supplied by the authors are incomplete and inconsistent with published descriptions of the survey.

<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual

(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

I’ve been happily using R for a number of years now and recently came across Stan. Looks big and powerful, so I’d like to pick an appropriate project and try it out. I wondered if you could point me to a link or document that goes into the motivation for this tool (aside from the Stan user doc)?  What I’d like to understand is, at what point might you look at an emergent R project and advise, “You know, that thing you’re trying to do would be a whole lot easier/simpler/more straightforward to implement with Stan.” (or words to that effect).
  
My reply:  For my collaborators in political science, Stan has been most useful for models where the data set is not huge (e.g., we might have 10,000 data points or 50,000 data points but not 10 million) but where the model is somewhat complex (for example, a model with latent time series structure).  The point is that the model has enough parameters and uncertainty that you’ll want to do full Bayes (rather than some sort</p><p>4 0.79113328 <a title="2178-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-07-My_recent_debugging_experience.html">2161 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-07-My recent debugging experience</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, so this sort of thing happens sometimes.  I was working on a new idea (still working on it; if it ultimately works out—or if it doesn’t—I’ll let you know) and as part of it I was fitting little models in Stan, in a loop.  I thought it would make sense to start with linear regression with normal priors and known data variance, because then the exact solution is Gaussian and I can also work with the problem analytically.  So I programmed up the algorithm and, no surprise, it didn’t work.  I went through my R code, put in print statements here and there, and cleared out bug after bug until at least it stopped crashing.  But the algorithm still wasn’t doing what it was supposed to do.
 
So I decided to do something simpler, and just check that the Stan linear regression gave the same answer as the analytic posterior distribution:  I ran Stan for tons of iterations, then computed the sample mean and variance of the simulations.  It was an example with two coefficients—I’d originally cho</p><p>5 0.77517849 <a title="2178-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic%21.html">1580 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic!</a></p>

I’ve been translating a few ongoing data analysis projects into  Stan  code, mostly with success. The most important for me right now has been a hierarchical zero-inflated gamma problem. This a “hurdle” model, in which a bernoulli GLM produces zeros/nonzeros, and then a gamma GLM produces the nonzero values, using varying effects correlated with those in the bernoulli process.


The data are 20 years of human foraging returns from a subsistence hunting population in Paraguay (the Ache), comprising about 15k hunts in total (Hill & Kintigh. 2009. Current Anthropology 50:369-377). Observed values are kilograms of meat returned to camp. The more complex models contain a 147-by-9 matrix of varying effects (147 unique hunters), as well as imputation of missing values.

<p>Introduction: The Difficulty with Difficult Questions 
 
Andrew’s commented during our Stan meetings that he’s observed that when a user sends an easy question to a mailing list, it gets answered right away, whereas difficult questions often languish with no answers.  
 
These difficult questions usually come from power users with real issues, whereas the simple questions are often ill-formulated or already answered in the top-level doc.  So we’re arguably devoting our energy to the wrong users by adopting this strategy.
 
Of course, this is related to Andrew’s suggestion that this whole blog be called “tl;dr” (i.e., too long, didn’t read).
 
 An Example 
 
On the  Stan Users Group , we often get very complex models with a simple accompanying question such as “How can I make my model faster or mix better?”  An example is  this recent query , which involves a difficult multivariate multilevel model.   Such questions require a lot of work on our part to answer.  Model fitting is hard and often very pr</p><p>2 0.92870605 <a title="2178-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-24-Flawed_visualization_of_U.S._voting_maybe_has_some_good_features.html">428 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-24-Flawed visualization of U.S. voting maybe has some good features</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this attractive visualization  by David Sparks of U.S. voting.
 
On the plus side, the pictures and associated movie (showing an oddly horizontally-stretched-out United States) are pretty and seem to have gotten a bit of attention–the maps have received 31 comments, which is more than we get on almost all our blog entries here.
 
On the minus side, the movie is misleading.  In many years it shows the whole U.S. as a single color, even when candidates from both parties won some votes.  The text has errors too, for example the false claim that the South favored a Democratic candidate in 1980.  The southern states that Jimmy Carter carried in 1980 were Georgia and . . . that’s it.
 
But, as Aleks says, once this tool is out there, maybe people can use it to do better.  It’s in that spirit that I’m linking.  Ya gotta start somewhere.
 
Also, this is a good example of a general principle:  When you make a graph, look at it carefully to see if it makes sense!</p><p>3 0.92545092 <a title="2178-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-25-Spam%21.html">2148 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-25-Spam!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one totally faked me out at first.  It was an email from “Nick Bagnall” that began:
  
Dear Dr. Gelman, 


I made contact last year regarding your work in the CMG: Reconstructing Climate from Tree Ring Data project. We are about to start producing the 2014 edition and I wanted to discuss this with you as we still remain keen to feature your work. 


Research Media are producing a special publication in February of 2014, within this report we will be working with a small selected number of PI’s with a focus on geosciences, atmospheric and geospace sciences and earth Sciences.. 
  
At this point, I’m thinking:  Hmmm, I don’t remember this guy, is this some sort of collaborative project that I’d forgotten about?
 
The message then continues:
  
The publication is called International Innovation . . .
  
Huh?  This doesn’t sound so good.  The email then goes on with some very long lists, and then finally the kicker:
  
The total cost for each article produced in this report is fixed a</p><p>4 0.921242 <a title="2178-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-17-%E2%80%9CStop_and_frisk%E2%80%9D_statistics.html">1942 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-17-“Stop and frisk” statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen  brings up  one of my research topics:
  
In New York City, blacks make up a quarter of the population, yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects — almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.


Those statistics represent the justification for New York City’s controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters, then it ought to be young black males whom the police stop and frisk.
  
I have two comments on this.  First,  my research with Jeff Fagan and Alex Kiss  (based on data from the late 1990s, so maybe things have changed) found that the NYPD was stopping blacks and hispanics at a rate  higher  than their previous arrest rates:
  
To briefly summarize our findings, blacks and Hispanics represented 51% and 33% of the stops while representing only 26% and 24% of the New York City population. Compared with the number of arrests of</p><p>5 0.92081523 <a title="2178-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-29-When_people_meet_this_guy%2C_can_they_resist_the_temptation_to_ask_him_what_he%E2%80%99s_doing_for_breakfast%3F%3F.html">980 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-29-When people meet this guy, can they resist the temptation to ask him what he’s doing for breakfast??</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  is hilarious ( link  from a completely deadpan Tyler Cowen).  I’d call it “unintentionally hilarious” but I’m pretty sure that rms knew this was funny when he was writing it.  It’s sort of like when you write a  top 10  list—it’s hard to resist getting silly and going over the top.  It’s only near the end that we get to the bit about the parrots.
 
All joking aside, the most interesting part of the email was this:
  
I [rms] have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every day* doing my usual work, which is responding to email about the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement.
  
I’d wondered for awhile what is it that Richard Stallman actually does, that is how does he spend his time (aside from giving lectures to promote his ideas and pay the bills).

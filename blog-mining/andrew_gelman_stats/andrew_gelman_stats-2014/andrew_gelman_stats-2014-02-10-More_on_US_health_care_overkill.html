Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>3 0.18084496 <a title="2205-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-04-Widening_the_goalposts_in_medical_trials.html">2199 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-04-Widening the goalposts in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Alper writes:
  
I do not believe your blog has ever dealt with the following phenomenon which might be called “(widening) moving the goalposts.”  Drug companies and the medical world at large often create powerful drugs and procedures for people who are far (many standard deviations) from the norm (mean) and via  randomized clinical trials, the relevant authorities approve.  But there aren’t enough of those people to be truly profitable so the next step is to ask for approval to prescribe the same for people who aren’t that far (fewer standard deviations) from the norm.  Or, just move the norm (center) so as to pick up a much larger number of patients.  Afflictions include hypertension, cholesterol, overweight, osteoporosis.  


The result is what is often called “the worried well,” who receive little or no benefit but suffer harms from the treatment.

From the press release:
  
Entries from around the world focused on data related to the economic costs and return on investment in education . . . [The winning entry] takes a detailed look at public vs. private and men vs. women for selected countries . . .


The judges were particularly impressed by the angled slope format of the visualisation, which encourages comparison between the upper-secondary and tertiary benefits of education. Szucs and Cziner were also lauded for  their striking visual design, which draws users into exploring their piece  [emphasis added].

<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally.

You recently  posted  my moving and widening the goalposts contention.  In it, I mentioned “how diagnoses increase markedly while deaths are flatlined” indicating that we are being overdiagnosed and overtreated. Above are 5 frightening  graphs  which illustrate the phenomenon.


Defenders of the system might (ludicrously) contend that it is precisely the aggressive medical care that is responsible for keeping the cancers under control.


The prostate cancer graph is particularly interesting because it shows the peaking of the PSA-driven cause of treatment in the 1990s which then falls off as the evidence accumulates that the PSA was far from a perfect indicator.  In contrast is the thyroid cancer which zooms skyward even as the death rate is absolutely (dead) flat. 
  
And of course here’s the famous cross-country comparison that some find “ schlocky ” but which I (and many others) find  compelling :</p><p>2 0.83696479 <a title="2205-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>3 0.83341688 <a title="2205-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-Defining_ourselves_arbitrarily.html">1411 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-Defining ourselves arbitrarily</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.
 
Robin Hanson happens not to use much slang and he uses this trait to define himself, not quite to stand out in the crowd but to put himself on one end of a scale.

<p>Introduction: Some thoughts from Christian , including this bit:
  
We need to consider separately


1. R’s brilliant library


2. R’s not-so-brilliant language and/or interpreter.
  
I don’t know that R’s library is so brilliant as all that–if necessary, I don’t think it would be hard to reprogram the important packages in a new language.
 
I would say, though, that the problems with R are not just in the technical details of the language.  I think the culture of R has some problems too.  As I’ve written before, R functions used to be lean and mean, and now they’re full of exception-handling and calls to other packages.  R functions are spaghetti-like messes of connections in which I keep expecting to run into syntax like “GOTO 120.”
 
I learned about these problems a couple years ago when writing bayesglm(), which is a simple adaptation of glm().  But glm(), and its workhorse, glm.fit(), are a mess:  They’re about 10 lines of functioning code, plus about 20 lines of necessary front-end, plus a cou</p><p>5 0.83160424 <a title="2205-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-12-Thinking_like_a_statistician_%28continuously%29_rather_than_like_a_civilian_%28discretely%29.html">1575 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-12-Thinking like a statistician (continuously) rather than like a civilian (discretely)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  writes :
  
When I hear someone say “personalized medicine” I want to ask “as opposed to what?”


All medicine is personalized. If you are in an emergency room with a broken leg and the person next to you is lapsing into a diabetic coma, the two of you will be treated differently.


The aim of personalized medicine is to increase the degree of personalization, not to introduce personalization. . . .
  
This to me is a statistical way of thinking, to change an “Is it or isn’t it?” question into a “How much?” question.  This distinction arises in many settings but particularly in discussions of causal inference, for example  here  and  here , where I use the “statistical thinking” approach of imagining everything as being on some continuous scale, in contrast to computer scientist Elias Bareinboim and psychology researcher Steven Sloman, both of whom prefer what might be called the “civilian” or “common sense” idea that effects are either real or not, or that certain data can</p><p>6 0.83060926 <a title="2205-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-08-chartsnthings_%21.html">1308 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-08-chartsnthings !</a></p>

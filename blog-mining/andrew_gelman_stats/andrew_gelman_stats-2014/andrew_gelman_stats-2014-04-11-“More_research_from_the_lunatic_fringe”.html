<p>Introduction: I was updating my Mac and noticed the following:
 
 
 
Lots of obscure European languages there.  That got me wondering:  what’s the least obscure language  not  on the above list?  Igbo?  Swahili?  Or maybe Tagalog?
 
I did a quick google and found  this  list of languages by number of native speakers.  Once you see the list, the answer is obvious:  Hindi, first language of 295 million people, is not on Apple’s list.  The next most popular languages not included:  Bengali, Punjabi, Javanese, Wu, Telegu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu.  Wow:  most of these are Indian!  Then comes Persian and a bunch of others.
 
It turns out that Tagalog, Igbo, and Swahili, are way down on this list with 28 million, 24 million, and 26 million native speakers, respectively.
 
Only 26 million for Swahili?  This made me want to check the  list of languages by total number of speakers .  The ranking of most of the languages isn’t much different, but Swahili is now #10, at 140 million.  Hindi and Bengali are still th</p><p>3 0.11419645 <a title="2289-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-07-Hey%2C_I%E2%80%99m_just_like_Picasso_%28but_without_all_the_babes%29%21.html">842 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-07-Hey, I’m just like Picasso (but without all the babes)!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Bruce Mannheim  reports  that a recent well-publicized study on the genetics of native Americans, which used genetic analysis to find “at least three streams of Asian gene flow,” is in fact a confirmation of a long-known fact.  Mannheim writes:
  
This three-way distinction was known linguistically since the 1920s (for example, Sapir 1921). Basically, it’s a division among the Eskimo-Aleut languages, which straddle the Bering Straits even today, the Athabaskan languages (which were discovered to be related to a small Siberian language family only within the last few years, not by Greenberg as Wade suggested), and everything else.
  
This is not to say that the results from genetics are unimportant, but it’s good to see how it fits with other aspects of our understanding.</p><p>5 0.094694443 <a title="2289-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-24-Foreign_language_skills_as_an_intrinsic_good%3B_also%2C_beware_the_tyranny_of_measurement.html">484 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-24-Foreign language skills as an intrinsic good; also, beware the tyranny of measurement</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This link  on education reform send me to  this blog  on foreign languages in Canadian public schools:
  
 
The demand for French immersion education in Vancouver so far outstrips the supply that the school board allocates places by lottery.


But why? Is it because French is a useful employment skill? Because learning to speak French makes you a better person? Or is it because parents know intuitively what economists can show econometrically: peer effects matter. Being with high achieving peers raises a student’s own achievement level. . . .


Several studies have found that Anglophones who can speak French enjoy an earning premium. The question is: do bilingual Anglophones earn more because speaking French is a valuable skill in the workplace? Or do they earn more because they’re on average smarter and more capable people (after all, they’ve mastered two languages)?

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>3 0.70605606 <a title="2289-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-04-Discussion_with_Dan_Kahan_on_political_polarization%2C_partisan_information_processing.__And%2C_more_generally%2C_the_role_of_theory_in_empirical_social_science.html">2050 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-04-Discussion with Dan Kahan on political polarization, partisan information processing.

My graphs– what do you think??

 

I guess what do you think of the result too, but the answer is, “That’s obvious!”  If it hadn’t been, then it would have been suspicious in my book. Of course, if we had found the opposite result, that would have been “obvious!” too.  We are submitting to   LR ≠1 Journa l 

 This is the latest study in series looking at relationship between critical reasoning capacities and “cultural cognition” — the tendency of individuals to conform their perceptions of risk & other policy-relevant facts to their group commitments. The first installment was an  observational study  that found that cultural polarization ( political too ; the distinction relate not to the mechanism for polarization over decision-relevant science but only about  how to measure  what is hypothesized to be driving it) increases as people become more science literate.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>5 0.694704 <a title="2289-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-27-A_whole_fleet_of_gremlins%3A__Looking_more_carefully_at_Richard_Tol%E2%80%99s_twice-corrected_paper%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_Economic_Effects_of_Climate_Change%E2%80%9D.html">2350 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-27-A whole fleet of gremlins:  Looking more carefully at Richard Tol’s twice-corrected paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We had a  discussion  the other day of a paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change,” by economist Richard Tol.
 
The paper came to my attention after I saw a  notice  from Adam Marcus that it was recently revised because of data errors.  But after looking at the paper more carefully, I see a bunch of other problems that, to me, make the whole analysis close to useless as it stands.
 
I think this is worth discussing because the paper has been somewhat influential (so far cited 328 times, according to Google Scholar) and has even been cited in the  popular press  as evidence that “Climate change has done more good than harm so far and is likely to continue doing so for most of this century . . . There are many likely effects of climate change: positive and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial. And if you aggregate them all, the overall effect is positive today — and likely to stay positive until around 2080.

<p>Introduction: A linguist send me an email with the above title and a  link  to a paper, “The Effect of Language on Economic Behavior: Evidence from Savings Rates, Health Behaviors, and Retirement Assets,” by M. Keith Chen, which begins:
  
Languages differ widely in the ways they encode time. I test the hypothesis that languages that grammatically associate the future and the present, foster future-oriented behavior. This prediction arises naturally when well-documented e§ects of language structure are merged with models of intertemporal choice. Empirically, I find that speakers of such languages: save more, retire with more wealth, smoke less, practice safer sex, and are less obese. This holds both across countries and within countries when comparing demographically similar native households. The evidence does not support the most obvious forms of common causation. I discuss implications for theories of intertemporal choice.
  
I ran this by another linguist who confirmed the “lunatic fringe” comme</p><p>2 0.94879961 <a title="2289-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Error_in_an_attribution_of_an_error.html">767 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Error in an attribution of an error</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you say that somebody else screwed up, you have to be extra careful you’re not  getting things wrong  yourself!

<p>Introduction: Julie Josse sends along this job announcement:
  
A post-doctoral position is available in the applied mathematics department of Agrocampus Rennes. The postdoc will be funded by the Henri Lebesgue Center (see http://www.lebesgue.fr/) if the application is selected. Applicants are expected to send their application before 31 March 2014.


The research focus is on development of new methods to deal with missing values and their implementation in the free R software to make them available. We study new multiple imputation methods based on principal component methods. 
   
Different aspects are expected to be covered: dealing with missing values in multi-blocks, multi-groups data (groups of individuals and variables); regularization in this framework using a Bayesian approach, dealing with different types of data (continuous, categoricals, etc.). Fields of application are wide and include biological data as well as socio-economic data.

<p>Introduction: I, like  Steve Hsu , I too would love to read a definitive biography of John von Neumann (or, as we’d say in the U.S., “John Neumann”).  I’ve read little things about him in various places such as Stanislaw Ulam’s classic autobiography, and two things I’ve repeatedly noticed are:
 
1.  Neumann comes off as a obnoxious, self-satisfied jerk.  He just seems like the kind of guy I wouldn’t like in real life.
 
2.  All these great men seem to really have loved the guy.
 
It’s hard for me to reconcile  two impressions above.  Of course, lots of people have a good side and a bad side, but what’s striking here is that my impressions of Neumann’s bad side come from the very stories that his friends use to demonstrate how lovable he was!  So, yes, I’d like to see the biography–but only if it could resolve this paradox.
 
Also, I don’t know how relevant this is, but Neumann shares one thing with the more-lovable Ulam and the less-lovable Mandelbrot:  all had Jewish backgrounds but didn’t seem to</p><p>5 0.94028366 <a title="2289-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-20-NYT_%28non%29-retraction_watch.html">2107 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-20-NYT (non)-retraction watch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko is  irritated  by the Times’s refusal to retract a recounting of a hoax regarding Dickens and Dostoevsky.  All I can say is, the Times refuses to retract mistakes of fact that are far more current than that!   See here  for two examples that particularly annoyed me, to the extent that I contacted various people at the Times but ran into refusals to retract.
 
I guess a daily newspaper publishes so much material that they can’t be expected to run a retraction every time they publish something false, even when such things are brought to their attention.
 
Speaking of corrections, I wonder if later editions of the Samuelson economics textbook discussed their notorious  graph  predicting Soviet economic performance.  The easiest thing would be just to remove the graph, but I think it would be a better economics lesson to discuss the error!
 
Similarly, I think the NYT would do well to run an article on their Dickens-Dostoevsky mistake, along with a column by Arthur Brooks on how</p><p>6 0.93970793 <a title="2289-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-20-Education_could_use_some_systematic_evaluation.html">1271 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-20-Education could use some systematic evaluation</a></p>

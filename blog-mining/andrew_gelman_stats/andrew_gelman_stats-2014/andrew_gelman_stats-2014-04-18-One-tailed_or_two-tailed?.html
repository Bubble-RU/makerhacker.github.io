I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

They are important because the probability that the true effect size is exactly zero is itself zero and could cause us to reject the null hypothesis inappropriately.

Lindley’s paradox describes a counterintuitive situation in which Bayesian and frequentist approaches to hypothesis testing give opposite results.

<p>Introduction: In response to the  discussion  of X and me of his recent  paper , Val Johnson writes:
  
I would like to thank Andrew for forwarding his comments on uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests (UMPBTs) to me and his invitation to respond to them.  I think he  (and also Christian Robert) raise a number of interesting points concerning this new class of Bayesian tests, but I think that they may have confounded several issues that might more usefully be examined separately.


The first issue involves the choice of the Bayesian evidence threshold, gamma, used in rejecting a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.  Andrew objects to the higher values of gamma proposed in my recent PNAS article on grounds that too many important scientific effects would be missed if thresholds of 25-50 were routinely used.  These evidence thresholds correspond roughly to p-values of 0.005; Andrew suggests that evidence thresholds around 5 should continue to be used (gamma=5 corresponds approximate</p><p>4 0.24055031 <a title="2295-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-24-Empirical_implications_of_Empirical_Implications_of_Theoretical_Models.html">2263 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-24-Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bloomfield writes:
  
Most of the people in my field (accounting, which is basically applied economics and finance, leavened with psychology and organizational behavior) use ‘positive research methods’, which are typically described as coming to the data with a predefined theory, and using hypothesis testing to accept or reject the theory’s predictions.  But a substantial minority use ‘interpretive research methods’ (sometimes called qualitative methods, for those that call positive research ‘quantitative’).  No one seems entirely happy with the definition of this method, but I’ve found it useful to think of it as an attempt to see the world through the eyes of your subjects, much as Jane Goodall lived with gorillas and tried to see the world through their eyes.)


Interpretive researchers often criticize positive researchers by noting that the latter don’t make the best use of their data, because they come to the data with a predetermined theory, and only test a narrow set of h</p><p>5 0.23149183 <a title="2295-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-23-Of_hypothesis_tests_and_Unitarians.html">1024 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-23-Of hypothesis tests and Unitarians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xian, Judith, and I read this line in a book by statistician Murray Aitkin in which he considered the following hypothetical example:
  
A survey of 100 individuals expressing support (Yes/No) for the president, before and after a presidential address . . . The question of interest is whether there has been a change in support between the surveys . . . We want to assess the evidence for the hypothesis of equality H1 against the alternative hypothesis H2 of a change.
  
Here is  our response :
  
Based on our experience in public opinion research, this is not a real question. Support for any political position is always changing. The real question is how much the support has changed, or perhaps how this change is distributed across the population.


A defender of Aitkin (and of classical hypothesis testing) might respond at this point that, yes, everybody knows that changes are never exactly zero and that we should take a more “grown-up” view of the null hypothesis, not that the change</p><p>6 0.21908225 <a title="2295-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-24-In_which_I_side_with_Neyman_over_Fisher.html">1869 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-24-In which I side with Neyman over Fisher</a></p>

Despite the myriad rules and procedures of science, some research findings are pure flukes. Perhaps you’re testing a new drug, and by chance alone, a large number of people spontaneously get better. The better your study is conducted, the lower the chance that your result was a fluke – but still, there is always a certain probability that it was.


Statistical significance testing gives you an idea of what this probability is.


In science we’re always testing hypotheses. We never conduct a study to ‘see what happens’, because there’s always at least one way to make any useless set of data look important.

<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  from Mark Palko.
 
 
 
I think of Palko’s post as having a lot of statistical content here, although it’s hard for me to say exactly why it feels that way to me.  Perhaps it has to do with the challenges of measurement, how something that would seem to be a simple problem of measurement (adding up the cost of staple foods) isn’t so easy after all, in fact it requires a lot of subject-matter knowledge, in this case knowledge that some guy named Ron Shaich whom I’ve never heard of (but that’s ok, I’m sure he’s never heard of me either) doesn’t have.  We’ve been talking a lot about measurement on this blog recently (for example,  here ), and I think this new story fits into these discussions somehow.</p><p>3 0.97891414 <a title="2295-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-03-Question_about_predictive_checks.html">1363 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-03-Question about predictive checks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Klaas Metselaar writes: 
  
  
I [Metselaar] am currently involved in a discussion about the use of the notion “predictive” as used in “posterior predictive check”. I would argue that the notion “predictive” should be reserved for posterior checks using information not used in the determination of the posterior. 
I quote from the discussion: 
“However, the predictive uncertainty in a Bayesian calculation requires sampling from all the random variables, and this includes both the model parameters and the residual error”.


My [Metselaar's] comment:


This may be exactly the point I am worried about: shouldn’t the predictive uncertainty be defined as sampling from the posterior parameter distribution +  residual error + sampling from the prediction error distribution? 
Residual error reduces to measurement error in the case of a  model which is perfect for the sample of experiments. Measurement error could be reduced to almost zero by ideal and perfect measurement instruments.

<p>Introduction: Statisticians take tours in other people’s data.
 
All methods of statistical inference rest on statistical models. Experiments typically have problems with compliance, measurement error, generalizability to the real world, and representativeness of the sample. Surveys typically have problems of undercoverage, nonresponse, and measurement error.
 
Real surveys are done to learn about the general population. But real surveys are not random samples. For another example, consider educational tests: what are they exactly measuring? Nobody knows. Medical research: even if it’s a randomized experiment, the participants in the study won’t be a random sample from the population for whom you’d recommend treatment. You don’t need random sampling to generalize the results of a medical experiment to the general population but you need some substantive theory to make the assumption that effects in your nonrepresentative sample of people will be similar to effects in the population of interest.

This time I’m sticking with  the plan :
 
1.  Don’t open a message until I’m ready to deal with it. 
2.  Don’t store anything–anything–in the inbox. 
3.  Put to-do items in the (physical) bookje rather than the (computer) “desktop.” 
4.  Never read email before 4pm.  (This is the one rule I  have  been following. 
5.  Only one email session per day.  (I’ll have to see how this one works.)</p><p>6 0.9774586 <a title="2295-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-18-Question_on_Type_M_errors.html">963 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-18-Question on Type M errors</a></p>

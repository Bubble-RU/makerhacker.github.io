I think this approach has some benefits but doesn’t really address the issues of preregistration that concern me—but I’d like to spend an entire blog post explaining why.  I have two key points:

</p><p>5 When the concern is the file drawer (the idea that Gelman or some other researcher performs lots of studies, and we want to hear about the failures as well as successes), “preregistration” is a “bare bones summary” that can be tweeted. [sent-15, score-0.176]
</p><p>6 Sure, preregistration doesn’t solve problems of experimental design. [sent-19, score-0.88]
</p><p>7 But I think it’s important to be clear what sort of preregistration we’re talking about in any particular case, and what we expect preregistration to be doing. [sent-21, score-1.45]
</p><p>8 Given that political science is (I assume) not among Neuroskeptic’s areas of expertise, I respect his or her decision to hold off judgment on the issue. [sent-24, score-0.058]

<p>Introduction: Chris Chambers and I had an enlightening discussion the other day at the blog of Rolf Zwaan, regarding the Garden of Forking Paths ( go here  and scroll down through the comments).
 
Chris sent me the following note:
  
I’m writing a book at the moment about reforming practices in psychological research (focusing on various bad practices such as p-hacking, HARKing, low statistical power, publication bias, lack of data sharing etc. – and posing solutions such as pre-registration, Bayesian hypothesis testing, mandatory data archiving etc.) and I am arriving at rather unsettling conclusion: that null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) simply isn’t valid for observational research. If this is true then most of the psychological literature is statistically flawed.


I was wonder what your thoughts were on this, both from a statistical point of view and from your experience working in an observational field.

<p>Introduction: I post (approximately) once a day and don’t plan to change that.
 
I have enough material to post more often—for example, I could intersperse existing blog posts with summaries of my published papers or of other work that I like; and, beyond this, we currently have a one-to-two-month backlog of posts—but I’m afraid that if the number of posts were doubled, the attention given to each would be roughly halved.
 
Looking at it the other way, I certainly don’t want to  reduce  my level of posting.  Sure, it takes time to blog, but these are things that are important for me to say.  If I were to blog less frequently, it would only be because I was pouring all these words into a different vessel, for example a book.  For now, though, I think it makes sense to blog and then collect the words later as appropriate.  With blogging I get comments, and many of these comments are helpful—either directly (by pointing out errors in my thinking or linking to relevant software or literature) or indirec</p><p>4 0.19661534 <a title="2241-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-31-Jessica_Tracy_and_Alec_Beall_%28authors_of_the_fertile-women-wear-pink_study%29_comment_on_our_Garden_of_Forking_Paths_paper%2C_and_I_comment_on_their_comments.html">2355 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-31-Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall (authors of the fertile-women-wear-pink study) comment on our Garden of Forking Paths paper, and I comment on their comments</a></p>

Our paper is unpublished, but I do have the megaphone of this blog, and Tracy and Beall do not, so I think it’s only fair to link to their note right away.

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.

<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Our statistics book made it possible for Kruschke to write his excellent book for psycholo</p><p>5 0.86948013 <a title="2241-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-08-Discussion_with_Steven_Pinker_on_research_that_is_attached_to_data_that_are_so_noisy_as_to_be_essentially_uninformative.html">2326 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-08-Discussion with Steven Pinker on research that is attached to data that are so noisy as to be essentially uninformative</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I pointed Steven Pinker to my post,  How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless? , and he responded:
  
Clearly it *is* important to call out publicized research whose conclusions are likely to be false. The only danger is that it’s so easy and fun to criticize, with all the perks of intellectual and moral superiority for so little cost, that there is a moral hazard to go overboard and become a professional slasher and snarker. (That’s a common phenomenon among literary critics, especially in the UK.) There’s also the risk of altering the incentive structure for innovative research, so that researchers stick to the safest kinds of paradigm-twiddling. I think these two considerations were what my late colleague Dan Wegner had in mind when he made the bumbler-pointer contrast — he himself was certainly a discerning critic of social science research.

<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

<p>Introduction: Chris Chambers pointed me to a blog by someone called Neuroskeptic who  suggested  that I preregister my political science studies:
  
So when Andrew Gelman (let’s say) is going to start using a new approach, he goes on Twitter, or on his blog, and posts a bare-bones summary of what he’s going to do. Then he does it. If he finds something interesting, he writes it up as a paper, citing that tweet or post as his preregistration. . . .
  
I think this approach has some benefits but doesn’t really address the issues of preregistration that concern me—but I’d like to spend an entire blog post explaining why.  I have two key points:
 
1.  If your study is crap, preregistration might fix it.  Preregistration is fine—indeed, the wide acceptance of preregistration might well motivate researchers to not do so many crap studies—but it doesn’t solve fundamental problems of experimental design.
 
2.  “Preregistration” seems to mean different things in different scenarios:

<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.  The input is the heat from solar radiation (easy enough to compute given the trajectory).  On the computer I tr</p><p>5 0.97982818 <a title="2241-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>6 0.9793793 <a title="2241-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>

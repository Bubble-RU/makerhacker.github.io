<br/><h2>meta infos for this blog</h2><p>Source: <a title="andrew_gelman_stats-2014-2204-html" href="http://andrewgelman.com/2014/02/09/keli-liu-xiao-li-meng-simpsons-paradox/">html</a></p><p>Introduction: XL sent me  this paper , “A Fruitful Resolution to Simpson’s Paradox via Multi-Resolution Inference.”
 
I told Keli and Xiao-Li that I wasn’t sure I fully understood the paper—as usual, XL is subtle and sophisticated, also I only get about half of his jokes—but I sent along these thoughts:
  
1.  I do not think counterfactuals or potential outcomes are necessary for Simpson’s paradox.  I say this because one can set up Simpson’s paradox with variables that cannot be manipulated, or for which manipulations are not directly of interest.


2.  Simpson’s paradox is part of a more general issue that regression coefs change if you add more predictors, the flipping of sign is not really necessary.


Here’s an example that I use in my teaching that illustrates both points:


I can run a regression predicting income from sex and height.  I find that the coef of sex is $10,000 (i.e., comparing a man and woman of the same height, on average the man will make $10,000 more) and the coefficient of h</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Simpson’s paradox is part of a more general issue that regression coefs change if you add more predictors, the flipping of sign is not really necessary.

</p><p>3 But the coef of sex in the above model seems very difficult to interpret:  why compare a man and a woman who are both 66 inches tall, for example? [sent-15, score-0.682]
</p><p>4 Keli replied:    There are variables which cannot be manipulated by a human, but it is still possible to imagine hypothetical manipulations. [sent-18, score-0.399]
</p><p>5 For example, we discuss how the color of a certain species of a plant is not really manipulable (it comes with the species). [sent-19, score-0.298]
</p><p>6 But one can imagine some sort of “proto”-plant which is that plant before it had color attached. [sent-20, score-0.347]
</p><p>7 We can now talk about manipulation of color for the proto-plant. [sent-21, score-0.423]
</p><p>8 The key however is that our unit of analysis has changed: when we think about manipulation of color, our fundamental unit is no longer plant but rather proto-plant. [sent-22, score-0.867]
</p><p>9 So we can always imagine hypothetical manipulations, but we need to keep careful accounting of what our unit of analysis is. [sent-23, score-0.514]
</p><p>10 Now to the second part of the question: why should we be interested in these hypothetical manipulations in the first place if we cannot perform the actual manipulation? [sent-24, score-0.32]
</p><p>11 Now suppose we want to study the effect of height on income. [sent-27, score-0.472]
</p><p>12 Our point is that to answer this question, you need to think about manipulation of height, even if it is only a hypothetical manipulation. [sent-29, score-0.561]
</p><p>13 In particular, when we think about the hypothetical manipulation of height, our unit of analysis is no longer an individual from the dataset (since these individuals come with height already). [sent-30, score-1.32]
</p><p>14 These “proto”-individuals have attributes but height is not one of these attributes—hence why we can think about manipulation of height. [sent-32, score-0.98]
</p><p>15 We should include in the regression all predictors which are attributes of this “proto”-individual, but leave out predictors which are not attributes of this “proto”-individual. [sent-33, score-0.681]
</p><p>16 When you say “indeed it would seem somehow ‘wrong’ to regress on height _without_ controlling for sex”, what you are implicitly doing in your mind is conceiving of this “proto”-individual and realizing that sex is in fact an attribute of this “proto”-individual. [sent-34, score-0.927]
</p><p>17 Similarly, when you say, “why compare a man and a woman who are both 66 inches tall, for example? [sent-35, score-0.346]
</p><p>18 ” what you have done is to imagine a hypothetical manipulation of gender. [sent-36, score-0.63]
</p><p>19 Hence we should not include height in the regression if our goal is to learn about the effect of gender. [sent-38, score-0.621]
</p><p>20 And I also think I can interpret those regressions without having to think about manipulation of height or of sex—to me, these are between-person comparisons, not requiring within-person manipulations. [sent-40, score-0.981]

<p>Introduction: I just want to share with you the best comment we’ve every had in the nearly ten-year history of this blog.  Also it has statistical content!
 
Here’s the story.  After seeing an amusing  article  by Tom Scocca relating how reporter John Lee Anderson called someone as a “little twerp” on twitter:
 
 
 
I  conjectured  that Anderson suffered from “tall person syndrome,” that problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.
 
But I had no idea of Anderson’s actual height.  Commenter Gary  responded  with this impressive bit of investigative reporting:
  
Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be about 9-10 inches taller than Catalina Garcia.


But how tall is Catalina Garcia? Not that tall – she’s  shorter  than the high-wire artist Phillipe Petit:

<p>Introduction: Best blog comment  ever , following up on our post, How tall is Jon Lee Anderson?:
  
Based on this picture: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/1640569735_05337bb974.jpg he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on this picture: http://www.catalinagarcia.com/cata/Libraries/BLOG_Images/Cata_w_Jon_Lee_Anderson.sflb.ashx he appears to be about 9-10 inches taller than Catalina Garcia.


But how tall is Catalina Garcia? Not that tall – she’s shorter than the high-wire artist Phillipe Petit http://www.catalinagarcia.com/cata/Libraries/BLOG_Images/Cata_w_Philippe_Petite.sflb.ashx. And he doesn’t appear to be that tall… about the same height as Claire Danes: http://cdn.theatermania.com/photo-gallery/Petit_Danes_Daldry_2421_4700.jpg – who according to Google is 5′ 6″.


So if Jon Lee Anderson is 10″ taller than Catalina Garcia, who is 2″ shorter than Philippe Petit, who is the same height as Claire Danes, then he is 6′ 2″ tall.

is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?  I [Bergman] have a sample size of roughly 400 people, and several binary variables correlate strongly with the outcome of interest and would also define interesting subgroups for analysis.  The problem is, stratifying over all of these (five or six) variables leaves me with strata that have only 1 person in them.  I have done some background reading on whether there is a rule of thumb for the maximum number of variables to stratify.  There does not seem to be much agreement (some say there should be between N/50-N/100 strata, others say as few as possible).  In economics, the paper I looked to is here, which seems to summarize literature related to clinical trials.  In short, my question is: is it bad to have several strata with 1 person in them?

<p>Introduction: This entry was posted by Phil Price. 
 
	A colleague is looking at data on car (and SUV and light truck) collisions and casualties.  He’s interested in causal relationships.  For instance, suppose car manufacturers try to improve gas mileage without decreasing acceleration.  The most likely way they will do that is to make cars lighter.  But perhaps lighter cars are more dangerous; how many more people will die for each mpg increase in gas mileage?
 
	There are a few different data sources, all of them seriously deficient from the standpoint of answering this question.  Deaths are very well reported, so if someone dies in an auto accident you can find out what kind of car they were in, what other kinds of cars (if any) were involved in the accident, whether the person was a driver or passenger, and so on.  But it’s hard to normalize:  OK, I know that N people who were passengers in a particular model of car died in car accidents last year, but I don’t know how many passenger-miles that</p><p>5 0.72654462 <a title="2204-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-30-Adjudicating_between_alternative_interpretations_of_a_statistical_interaction%3F.html">2274 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-30-Adjudicating between alternative interpretations of a statistical interaction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jacob Felson writes:
  
Say we have a statistically significant interaction in non-experimental data between two continuous predictors, X and Z and it is unclear which variable is primarily a cause and which variable is primarily a moderator.  One person might find it more plausible to think of X as a cause and Z as a moderator and another person may think the reverse more plausible.  My question then is whether there is are any set of rules or heuristics you could recommend to help adjudicate between alternate perspectives on such an interaction term.
  
My reply:
 
I think in this setting, it would make sense to think about different interventions, some of which affect X, others of which affect Z, others of which affect both, and go from there.  Rather than trying to isolate a single causal path, consider different cases of forward casual inference.  My guess is that the different stories regarding moderators etc. could motivate different thought experiments (and, ultimately, differe</p><p>6 0.71482784 <a title="2204-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-05-Understanding_regression_models_and_regression_coefficients.html">1656 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-05-Understanding regression models and regression coefficients</a></p>

<p>Introduction: XL sent me  this paper , “A Fruitful Resolution to Simpson’s Paradox via Multi-Resolution Inference.”
 
I told Keli and Xiao-Li that I wasn’t sure I fully understood the paper—as usual, XL is subtle and sophisticated, also I only get about half of his jokes—but I sent along these thoughts:
  
1.  I do not think counterfactuals or potential outcomes are necessary for Simpson’s paradox.  I say this because one can set up Simpson’s paradox with variables that cannot be manipulated, or for which manipulations are not directly of interest.


2.  Simpson’s paradox is part of a more general issue that regression coefs change if you add more predictors, the flipping of sign is not really necessary.


Here’s an example that I use in my teaching that illustrates both points:


I can run a regression predicting income from sex and height.  I find that the coef of sex is $10,000 (i.e., comparing a man and woman of the same height, on average the man will make $10,000 more) and the coefficient of h</p><p>2 0.92064106 <a title="2204-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-%E2%80%9CGenomics%E2%80%9D_vs._genetics.html">303 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-“Genomics” vs. genetics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>3 0.9032855 <a title="2204-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-29-Data_mining_and_allergies.html">685 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-29-Data mining and allergies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all this data floating around, there are some interesting analyses one can do. I came across  “The Association of Tree Pollen Concentration Peaks and Allergy Medication Sales in New York City: 2003-2008″  by  Perry Sheffield . There they correlate pollen counts with anti-allergy medicine sales – and indeed find that two days after high pollen counts, the medicine sales are the highest.
 
 
 
Of course, it would be interesting to play with the data to see *what* tree is actually causing the sales to increase the most. Perhaps this would help the arborists what trees to plant. At the moment they seem to be following  a rather sexist approach  to tree planting:
  

Ogren says the city could solve the problem by planting only female trees, which don’t produce pollen like male trees do.


City arborists shy away from females because many produce messy – or in the case of ginkgos, smelly – fruit that litters sidewalks.


In Ogren’s opinion, that’s a mistake. He says the females only pro</p><p>4 0.89899397 <a title="2204-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-16-The_lamest%2C_grudgingest%2C_non-retraction_retraction_ever.html">1626 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-16-The lamest, grudgingest, non-retraction retraction ever</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>5 0.89540499 <a title="2204-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Of_forecasts_and_graph_theory_and_characterizing_a_statistical_method_by_the_information_it_uses.html">1214 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Of forecasts and graph theory and characterizing a statistical method by the information it uses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta points me to  “EigenBracket 2012: Using Graph Theory to Predict NCAA March Madness Basketball”  and writes, “I [Folta] have got to believe that he’s simply re-invented a statistical method in a graph-ish context, but don’t know enough to judge.”
 
I have not looked in detail at the method being presented here—I’m not much of college basketball fan—but I’d like to use this as an excuse to make one of my favorite general point, which is that a good way to characterize any statistical method is by what information it uses. 
   
The basketball ranking method here uses score differentials between teams in the past season.  On the plus side, that is better than simply using one-loss records (which (a) discards score differentials and (b) discards information on who played whom).  On the minus side, the method appears to be discretizing the scores (thus throwing away information on the exact score differential) and doesn’t use any external information such as external ratings.

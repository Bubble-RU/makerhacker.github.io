<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.
  
But these numbers are incorrect, as I learned from a professor of oncology at the Univ</p><p>3 0.23408477 <a title="2280-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-14-1.5_million_people_were_told_that_extreme_conservatives_are_happier_than_political_moderates.__Approximately_.0001_million_Americans_learned_that_the_opposite_is_true..html">1458 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-14-1.5 million people were told that extreme conservatives are happier than political moderates.  Approximately .0001 million Americans learned that the opposite is true.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A Brooks op-ed  in the New York Times (circulation approximately 1.5 million):
  
People at the extremes are happier than political moderates. . . . none, it seems, are happier than the Tea Partiers . . .
  
 Jay Livingston  on his blog (circulation approximately 0 (rounding to the nearest million)), giving data from the 2009-2010 General Social Survey, which is the usual place people turn to for population data on happiness of Americans:
  
   


The GSS does not offer “bitter” or “Tea Party” as choices, but extreme conservatives are nearly three times as likely as others to be “not too happy.”
  
Livingston reports that the sample size for “Extremely Conservative” here is 80.  Thus the standard error for that green bar on the right is approx sqrt(0.3*0.7/80)=0.05.
 
So how could Brooks have made such a mistake?  I can think of two possibilities:
 
1.  Brooks has some other data source that directly addresses the happiness of supporters of the Tea Party movement.
 
2.  Brooks looked a</p><p>4 0.22074045 <a title="2280-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-24-Always_check_your_evidence.html">1025 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-24-Always check your evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Logical reasoning typically takes the following form:
 
1.  I know that A is true. 
2.  I know that A implies B. 
3.  Therefore, I can conclude that B is true.
 
I, like Lewis Carroll, have  problems  with this process sometimes, but it’s pretty standard.
 
There is also a statistical version in which the above statements are replaced by averages (“A usually happens,” etc.).
 
But in all these stories, the argument can fall down if you get the facts wrong.  Perhaps that’s one reason that statisticians can be obsessed with detail. 
   
For example, David Brooks wrote the following, in a  column  called “Living with Mistakes”:
  
The historian Leslie Hannah identified the ten largest American companies in 1912. None of those companies ranked in the top 100 companies by 1990.
  
Huh?  Could that really be?  I googled “ten largest american companies 1912″ and found  this , from Leslie Hannah:
 
  
 
No big deal:  two still in the top 10 rather than zero in the top 100, but Brooks’s general</p><p>5 0.21051192 <a title="2280-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-20-NYT_%28non%29-retraction_watch.html">2107 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-20-NYT (non)-retraction watch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko is  irritated  by the Times’s refusal to retract a recounting of a hoax regarding Dickens and Dostoevsky.  All I can say is, the Times refuses to retract mistakes of fact that are far more current than that!   See here  for two examples that particularly annoyed me, to the extent that I contacted various people at the Times but ran into refusals to retract.
 
I guess a daily newspaper publishes so much material that they can’t be expected to run a retraction every time they publish something false, even when such things are brought to their attention.
 
Speaking of corrections, I wonder if later editions of the Samuelson economics textbook discussed their notorious  graph  predicting Soviet economic performance.  The easiest thing would be just to remove the graph, but I think it would be a better economics lesson to discuss the error!
 
Similarly, I think the NYT would do well to run an article on their Dickens-Dostoevsky mistake, along with a column by Arthur Brooks on how</p><p>6 0.20869642 <a title="2280-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-20-Education_could_use_some_systematic_evaluation.html">1271 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-20-Education could use some systematic evaluation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.
  
But these numbers are incorrect, as I learned from a professor of oncology at the Univ</p><p>4 0.78615689 <a title="2280-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-28-Different_modes_of_discourse.html">1743 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-28-Different modes of discourse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.  Negotiation doesn</p><p>5 0.77843177 <a title="2280-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-20-NYT_%28non%29-retraction_watch.html">2107 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-20-NYT (non)-retraction watch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko is  irritated  by the Times’s refusal to retract a recounting of a hoax regarding Dickens and Dostoevsky.  All I can say is, the Times refuses to retract mistakes of fact that are far more current than that!   See here  for two examples that particularly annoyed me, to the extent that I contacted various people at the Times but ran into refusals to retract.
 
I guess a daily newspaper publishes so much material that they can’t be expected to run a retraction every time they publish something false, even when such things are brought to their attention.
 
Speaking of corrections, I wonder if later editions of the Samuelson economics textbook discussed their notorious  graph  predicting Soviet economic performance.  The easiest thing would be just to remove the graph, but I think it would be a better economics lesson to discuss the error!
 
Similarly, I think the NYT would do well to run an article on their Dickens-Dostoevsky mistake, along with a column by Arthur Brooks on how</p><p>6 0.77403373 <a title="2280-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-21-Red_state_blue_state%2C_or%2C_states_and_counties_are_not_persons.html">1587 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-21-Red state blue state, or, states and counties are not persons</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I followed  this link  from Chris Blattman to  an article  by economist Roland Fryer, who writes:
  
I [Fryer] find no evidence that teacher incentives increase student performance, attendance, or graduation, nor do I find any evidence that the incentives change student or teacher behavior.
  
What struck me were not the findings (which, as Fryer notes in his article, are plausible enough) but the use of the word “I” rather than “we.”  A field experiment is a big deal, and I was surprised to read that Fryer did it all by himself!
 
Here’s the note of acknowledgments (on the first page of the article):

<p>Introduction: Boris  writes :
  
 
By nearly all accounts, the Republicans looks set to take over the US House of Representatives in next week’s November 2010 general election. . . . Republicans, in this wave election that recalls 1994, look set to win not just swing districts, but also those districts that have been traditionally Democratic, or those with strong or longtime Democratic incumbents. Naturally, just as in 2008, this has led to overclaiming by jubilant conservatives and distraught liberals-though the adjectives were then reversed-that this portends a realignment in American politics. . . .


Republican moderates in Congress are often associated with two factors: 1) a liberal voting record earlier in their career, and 2) a liberal district. Of course, both are related, in the sense that ambitious moderates choose liberal districts to run in, and liberal districts weed out conservative candidates. . . . Given how competitive Republicans are in 2010, even in otherwise unfriendly territory,</p><p>3 0.96815681 <a title="2280-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-05-Racism%21.html">321 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-05-Racism!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last night I spoke at the Columbia Club of New York, along with some of my political science colleagues, in a  panel  about politics, the economy, and the forthcoming election.  The discussion was fine . . . until one guy in the audience accused us of bias based on what he imputed as our ethnicity.  One of the panelists replied by asking the questioner what of all the things we had said was biased, and the questioner couldn’t actually supply any examples.
 
It makes sense that the questioner couldn’t come up with a single example of bias on our part, considering that we were actually presenting  facts .
 
At some level, the questioner’s imputation of our ethnicity and accusation of bias isn’t so horrible.  When talking with my friends, I engage in casual ethnic stereotyping all the time–hey, it’s a free country!–and one can certainly make the  statistical  argument that you can guess people’s ethnicities from their names, appearance, and speech patterns, and in turn you can infer a lot</p><p>4 0.96625268 <a title="2280-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-06-Bayesian_model-building_by_pure_thought%3A__Some_principles_and_examples.html">1156 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-06-Bayesian model-building by pure thought:  Some principles and examples</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  is one of my favorite papers:
  
In applications, statistical models are often restricted to what produces reasonable estimates based on the data at hand. In many cases, however, the principles that allow a model to be restricted can be derived theoretically, in the absence of any data and with minimal applied context. We illustrate this point with three well-known theoretical examples from spatial statistics and time series. First, we show that an autoregressive model for local averages violates a principle of invariance under scaling. Second, we show how the Bayesian estimate of a strictly-increasing time series, using a uniform prior distribution, depends on the scale of estimation. Third, we interpret local smoothing of spatial lattice data as Bayesian estimation and show why uniform local smoothing does not make sense. In various forms, the results presented here have been derived in previous work; our contribution is to draw out some principles that can be derived theoretic</p><p>5 0.96574795 <a title="2280-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Popular_governor%2C_small_state.html">159 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Popular governor, small state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, upon the selection of Sarah Palin as vice-presidential nominee, I made some graphs of the popularity of governors of different-sized states:
 
 
 
As I wrote  at the time :
 
It seems to be easier to maintain high approval in a small state. What’s going on? Some theories: in a large state, there will be more ambitious politicians on the other side, eager to knock off the incumbent governor; small states often have part-time legislatures and thus the governor is involved in less political conflict; small states (notably Alaska) tend to get more funds per capita from the federal government, and it’s easier to be popular when you can disburse more funds; large states tend to be more heterogeneous and so it’s harder to keep all the voters happy.
 
I was curious how things have been going more recently, and Hanfei made an updated graph using data from  this archive .  Here’s the story:

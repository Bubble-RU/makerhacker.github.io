<p>Introduction: Just as scientists should never really have to think much about statistics, I feel that, in an ideal world, statisticians would never have to worry about computing.  In the real world, though, we have to spend a lot of time building our own tools.
 
It would be great if we could routinely run R with speed and memory limitations being less of a concern.  One suggestion that sometimes arises is to run things on “the cloud.”  So I was interested upon receiving this email from Niklas Frassa:
  
 
Time intensive calculations, as known from life science, finance or business intelligence, can now be processed at a whole new level of speed – in the Cloud. cloudnumbers.com provides an intuitive platform that enables everyone to run time consuming calculations on clusters with more than 1000 CPUs.


So far, High Performance Computing has only been accessible for large corporations and universities leading to significant competitive disadvantages for small and medium-sized companies.

The course went really well (it was a couple of years ago now). The course was run through a partnership my department has with the Ontario Fire College. Basically, firefighters can do a certificate and sometimes a degree in public administration and part of that is a course on methods. It was a small group — about 8 or so — very motivated guys (all guys). Some of them were chiefs or deputy chiefs from small towns, others captains who were doing the certificate in order to improve their chances for promotion or as a step into a broader public admin career. 


I had asked them ahead of time to bring with them whatever data they could get their hands on and that they thought would be interesting. This included response times, data on professional v voluntary firefighters, some insurance data and the like.

<p>Introduction: In connection with  this  workshop, I was asked to write a few paragraphs describing my perspective on “the current and near-term future state of the statistical sciences you are most familiar with.”  Here’s what I wrote:
  
I think that, at any given time, the field of statistics has a core, but that core changes over time.  There are different paradigmatic ways to solve problems.


100 or 150 years ago, the thing to do was to identify a phenomenon of interest with some probability distribution and then use the mathematics of that distribution to gain insight into the underlying process.  Thus, for example, if certain data looked like they came from a normal distribution, one could surmise that the values in question arose by adding many small independent pieces.  If the data looked like they came from a binomial distribution, that would imply independence and equal probabilities.  Waiting times that followed an exponential distribution could be considered as coming from a memoryless</p><p>5 0.085065164 <a title="2307-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-NYC_Data_Skeptics_Meetup.html">1837 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-NYC Data Skeptics Meetup</a></p>

The hype surrounding Big Data and Data Science is at a fever pitch with promises to solve the worldâ&euro;&trade;s business and social problems, large and small. How accurate or misleading is this message? How is it helping or damaging people, and which people? What opportunities exist for data nerds and entrepreneurs that examine the larger issues with a skeptical view?


 This Meetup  focuses on mathematical, ethical, and business aspects of data from a skeptical perspective. Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling. We will take deep dives into models in the fields of Data Science, statistics, financial engineering, and economics.

Your  recent post  on sharing data was of great interest to me, as my own research in computer science asks how to incentivize and lower barriers to data sharing.   I was particularly curious about your highlighting of effort as the major dis-incentive to sharing.  I would love to hear more, as this question of effort is on we specifically target in our development of tools for data authoring and publishing.


As a straw man, let me point out that sharing data technically requires no more than posting an excel spreadsheet online.  And that you likely already produced that spreadsheet during your own analytic work.   So, in what way does such low-tech publishing fail to meet your data sharing objectives?


Our own hypothesis has been that the effort is really quite low, with the problem being a lack of *immediate/tangible* benefits (as opposed to the long-term values you accurately describe).  To attack this problem, we’re developing  tools  (and, since it appear</p><p>3 0.78124654 <a title="2307-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-08-Turning_pages_into_data.html">192 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-08-Turning pages into data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There is a lot of data on the web, meant to be looked at by people, but how do you turn it into a spreadsheet people could actually  analyze  statistically? 
 
The technique to turn web pages intended for people into structured data sets intended for computers is called “screen scraping.” It has just been made easier with a wiki/community  http://scraperwiki.com/ . 
 
They provide libraries to extract information from PDF, Excel files, to automatically fill in forms and similar. Moreover, the community aspect of it should allow researchers doing similar things to get connected. It’s very good. Here’s an example of scraping  road accident data  or  port of London ship arrivals .
 
You can already find collections of structured data online, examples are  Infochimps  (“find the world’s data”), and  Freebase  (“An entity graph of people, places and things, built by a community that loves open data.”).

A friend of mine and I  cited  your  open data article  in our attempts to persuade a professor at another institution [Brian Leiter] into releasing the raw data from his influential rankings of philosophy departments. He is now claiming the national security response:

 
. . . disclosing the reputational data would violate the terms on  which the evaluators agreed to complete the surveys (did they even bother to read the description of the methodology, one wonders?).
 

I [Helzner] do not find this to be a compelling reply in this case. In fact, I  would say that when such data cannot be disclosed it reveals a flaw in the design of the survey. Experimental designs must be open so  that others can run the experiment. Mathematical proofs must be open so that they can be reviewed by others.

<p>Introduction: This post is by  David K. Park  
  
 As we have witnessed, the term “big data” has been thrusted onto the zeitgeist in the past several years, however, when one pushes beyond the hype, there seems to be little substance there. We’ve always had “data” so what so unique about it this time? Yes, we recognize it’s “big” but is there anything unique about data this time around? 
  

I’ve spend some time thinking about this and the answer seems to be yes, and it falls on three dimensions:

 
 
  Capturing Conversations & Relationships : Individuals have always communicated with one another, but now we can capture some of that conversation – email, blogs, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest) – and we can now do it with machines via sensors, ie “the internet of things” as we hear so much about; 
  Granularity : We can now understand individuals at a much finer level of analysis. No longer do we need to rely on a sample size of 500 people to “represent” the nation, but instead we can acc</p><p>2 0.94713348 <a title="2307-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-10-If_an_entire_article_in_Computational_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_were_put_together_from_other%2C_unacknowledged%2C_sources%2C_would_that_be_a_work_of_art%3F.html">1161 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-10-If an entire article in Computational Statistics and Data Analysis were put together from other, unacknowledged, sources, would that be a work of art?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Spy novelist Jeremy Duns  tells  the amazing story of Quentin Rowan, a young writer who based an entire career on patching together stories based on uncredited material from published authors, culminating in a patchwork job that Duns had blurbed as an “instant classic.”
 
Rowan did not merely plagiarize to fill in some gaps or cover some technical material that he was too lazy to rewrite; rather, he put together an entire novel out of others’ material. Rowan writes (as part of a longer passage that itself appears to be dishonest; see the November 15, 2011 5:36 AM comment later on in the thread):
  
I [Rowan] sat there with the books [by others] on my kitchen table and typed the passages up word for word. I had a plot in mind, initially, and looked for passages that would work within that context. People told me the initial plot was dull (spies being killed all over Europe – no one knows why), so I changed it to be more like the premise of McCarry’s “Second Sight” which was a whole lot</p><p>3 0.94229633 <a title="2307-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-10-Matching_and_regression%3A__two_great_tastes_etc_etc.html">796 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-10-Matching and regression:  two great tastes etc etc</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Bogard writes:
  
Regarding the book Mostly Harmless Econometrics, you  state :

 
A casual reader of the book might be left with the unfortunate impression that matching is a competitor to regression rather than a tool for making regression more effective.
 

But in fact isn’t that what they are arguing, that, in a  ‘mostly harmless way’ regression is in fact a matching estimator itself?


“Our view is that regression can be motivated as a particular sort of weighted matching estimator, and therefore the differences between regression and matching estimates are unlikely to be of major empirical importance” (Chapter 3 p. 70)


They seem to be distinguishing regression (without prior matching) from all other types of matching techniques, and therefore implying that regression can be a ‘mostly harmless’ substitute or competitor to matching. My previous understanding, before starting this book was as you say, that matching is a tool that makes regression more effective.

<p>Introduction: Someone sent me the following email:
  
I tried to do a logistic regression . . . I programmed the model in different ways and got different answers . . . can’t get the results to match . . . What am I doing wrong? . . . Here’s my code . . . 
  
I didn’t have the time to look at his code so I gave the following general response:
 
One way to check things is to try simulating data from the fitted model, then fit your model again to the simulated data and see what happens.
 
P.S.  He followed my suggestion and responded a few days later:
  
Yeah, that did the trick!  I was treating a factor variable as a covariate!

<p>Introduction: When we suggest a new method, we are duty-bound to not just demonstrate that it works better than existing approaches (or is superior in some other way such as simplicity or cost).  We also need to explain why, if this new method is so great, people aren’t  already  using it.
 
Various answers are possible, for example:
 
- The new idea is technically advanced, requiring a level of mathematical or engineering complexity such that it could not easily have been discovered by accident.  Hence its novelty can be explained as a product of some particular historical process.
 
- The new idea is clever and unexpected, as with the mechanical device underlying Rubik’s Cube.
 
- The new idea could only exist given recent technological developments (perhaps hardware developments such as a new composite material or an ultralight battery, or software developments such as a new MCMC algorithm).
 
- The new idea usually isn’t so impressive but it shows its virtues in some previously hidden domain (fo</p><p>6 0.94124126 <a title="2307-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-08-Understanding_Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_using_a_graph.html">2286 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-08-Understanding Simpson’s paradox using a graph</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil
 
A  recent post on this blog  discusses a prominent case of an Excel error leading to substantially wrong results from a statistical analysis. Excel is notorious for this because it is easy to add a row or column of data (or intermediate results) but forget to update equations so that they correctly use the new data. That particular error is less common in a language like R because R programmers usually refer to data by variable name (or by applying functions to a named variable), so the same code works even if you add or remove data.
 
Still, there is plenty of opportunity for errors no matter what language one uses. Andrew  ran into problems  fairly recently, and also blogged about  another instance.  I’ve never had to retract a paper, but that’s partly because I haven’t published a whole lot of papers. Certainly I have found plenty of substantial errors pretty late in some of my data analyses, and I obviously don’t have sufficient mechanisms in place to be sure</p><p>3 0.14176913 <a title="2190-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-13-Ross_Ihaka_to_R%3A__Drop_Dead.html">272 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-13-Ross Ihaka to R:  Drop Dead</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert posts  these thoughts :
  
I [Ross Ihaka] have been worried for some time that R isn’t going to provide the base that we’re going to need for statistical computation in the future. (It may well be that the future is already upon us.)  There are certainly efficiency problems (speed and memory use), but there are more fundamental issues too. Some of these were inherited from S and some are peculiar to R.

 One of the worst problems is scoping. Consider the following little gem.

 
  f =function() { 
if (runif(1) > .5) 
x = 10 
x 
} 

 

The x being returned by this function is randomly local or global. There are other examples where variables alternate between local and non-local throughout the body of a function. No sensible language would allow this.  It’s ugly and it makes optimisation really difficult.  This isn’t the only problem, even weirder things happen  because of interactions between scoping and lazy evaluation.


In light of this, I [Ihaka] have come to the c</p><p>4 0.10429926 <a title="2190-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-17-ff.html">418 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-17-ff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>5 0.095502742 <a title="2190-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-05-Call_for_book_proposals.html">557 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-05-Call for book proposals</a></p>

Large and complex datasets are becoming prevalent in the social and behavioral sciences and statistical methods are crucial for the analysis and interpretation of such data. The Chapman & Hall/CRC Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series aims to capture new developments in statistical methodology with particular relevance to applications in the social and behavioral sciences. It seeks to promote appropriate use of statistical, econometric and psychometric methods in these applied sciences by publishing a broad range of monographs, textbooks and handbooks.


The scope of the series is wide, including applications of statistical methodology in sociology, psychology, economics, education, marketing research, political science, criminology, public policy, demography, survey methodology and official statistics.

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.

<p>Introduction: The Stan meeting today reminded me of Joel Spolsky’s recasting of the Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the Painter. Joel retold it on his blog,  Joel on Software , in the post  Back to Basics :
  

Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”


“I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”

Certainly I have found plenty of substantial errors pretty late in some of my data analyses, and I obviously don’t have sufficient mechanisms in place to be sure</p><p>5 0.68077141 <a title="2190-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-17-ff.html">418 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-17-ff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>6 0.67555195 <a title="2190-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-09-The_future_of_R.html">266 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-09-The future of R</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrew and I have been discussing how we’re going to define functions in Stan for defining systems of differential equations;  see our evolving  ode design doc ;  comments welcome, of course.
 
 About Scope 
 
I mentioned to Andrew I would prefer pure lexical, static scoping, as found in languages like C++ and Java.  If you’re not familiar with the alternatives, there’s a nice overview in the  Wikipedia article on scope .  Let me call out a few passages that will help set the context.
  

A fundamental distinction in scoping is what “context” means – whether name resolution depends on the location in the source code (lexical scope, static scope, which depends on the lexical context) or depends on the program state when the name is encountered (dynamic scope, which depends on the execution context or calling context). Lexical resolution can be determined at compile time, and is also known as early binding, while dynamic resolution can in general only be determined at run time, and thus</p><p>2 0.92531538 <a title="2190-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Gregor_Mendel%E2%80%99s_suspicious_data.html">1449 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Gregor Mendel’s suspicious data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points me to a  thoughtful discussion  by Moti Nissani on “Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox.”
 
The paradox, as Nissani defines it, is that Mendel’s data seem in many cases too good to be true, yet Mendel had a reputation for probity and it seems doubtful that he had a Mark-Hauser-style attitude toward reporting scientific data.  Nissani writes:
  
Taken together, the situation seems paradoxical. On the one hand, we have evidence that “the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel’s expectations.” We also have good reasons to believe that Mendel encountered linkage but failed to report it and that he may have taken the somewhat unusual step of having his scientific records destroyed shortly after his death. On the other hand, everything else we know about him/in addition to his undisputed genius/suggests a man of unimpeachable integrity, fine observational powers, and a pa</p><p>3 0.91895372 <a title="2190-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert_update%3A__cartooning_can_give_you_the_strength_to_open_jars_with_your_bare_hands.html">664 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert update:  cartooning can give you the strength to open jars with your bare hands</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>4 0.90512586 <a title="2190-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-26-Antman_again_courts_controversy.html">973 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-26-Antman again courts controversy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>5 0.89779627 <a title="2190-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-19-Thiel_update.html">525 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-19-Thiel update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.

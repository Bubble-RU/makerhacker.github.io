(“According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.”  And, yes, the work they were shooting down really is that bad.)
 
If you want to see what the fuss is about, just google “2.9013.”   Here’s  an example (from 2012) of an uncritical reporting of the claim,  here’s  another one from 2010,  here’s  one from 2011 . . . well, you get the idea.
 
And  here’s a quick summary  posted by Rolf Zwaan after Brown et al. came out with their paper.
 
I know Sokal and Brown and so this story was not news to me.  I didn’t post anything about it on this blog because it seemed like it was getting enough coverage elsewhere.

</p><p>3 I think Nick Brown did a good job tracking this one down, and I don’t envy them the effort it took for them to publish their criticism in the American Psychologist. [sent-17, score-0.367]
</p><p>4 And of course I did not attempt to publish a letter in Psychological Science for each of their flawed papers (that would be a lot of letters! [sent-19, score-0.174]

</p><p>6 I was bothered by a headline    But that’s not why I wrote this post. [sent-23, score-0.179]
</p><p>7 The reason is that I was bothered by the subheadline, “The astonishing story of Nick Brown, the British man who began a part-time psychology course in his 50s – and ended up taking on America’s academic establishment. [sent-24, score-0.4]
</p><p>8 ”  I have no doubt that the author of the debunked work is indeed an establishment figure in American academia; the news article (see link at top of this post) makes that clear enough. [sent-26, score-0.437]
</p><p>9 But I’m also pretty sure that (a) most of America’s academic establishment had never heard of this work, and (b) many of the establishment who  had  heard of it, thought it was silly. [sent-27, score-0.806]
</p><p>10 After all, I’m part of America’s academic establishment too! [sent-28, score-0.452]
</p><p>11 So, while I liked Andrew Anthony’s reporting on this one, I thought the subheadline was misleading. [sent-29, score-0.192]
</p><p>12 I think they found a bad paper and then put in a big pile of effort to not just refute it, but to get their refutation published in a visible place. [sent-32, score-0.231]
</p><p>13 It’s not so much that they needed to fight the establishment; it’s more that they had to swim through the molasses which is the conventional attitude that presumes that a scientific claim is correct, just because it has been published in a respected journal. [sent-33, score-0.331]

[sent-43, score-0.797]
</p><p>18 At one level, I can understand this—the original article requires substantive research, while the correction can often be done just using methodological criticism alone—but the result is that lots of stuff that shouldn’t really be believed sits around in the literature.

<p>Introduction: I don’t want to make a  habit  of this, but . . . I was curious what Easterbrook would write as a follow-up to his recent Huntsman puff, and here’s what he  came up  with:
  
Tired of cookie-cutter political contests between hauntingly similar candidates? Then you’re going to like the upcoming race for one of the Senate seats in the late Ted Kennedy’s haunting grounds. Elizabeth Warren, best known for creating and fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is hoping to challenge Republican incumbent Scott Brown. They’re both qualified, but they couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.
  
Um, no.
 
1.  It seems a bit of a stretch to say the two candidates “couldn’t be more different personally.”  Brown is a 52-year-old married white lawyer with two children.  Warren is a 62-year-old married white lawyer with three children.  According to Wikipedia, they both had middle-class backgrounds, Brown in Massachusetts and Warren in Oklahoma, and they suffered some per</p><p>3 0.17856659 <a title="2177-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-27-Hey%2C_look_over_here%21__Another_rant%21.html">928 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-27-Hey, look over here!

<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.15011315 <a title="2177-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-19-The_replication_and_criticism_movement_is_not_about_suppressing_speculative_research%3B_rather%2C_it%E2%80%99s_all_about_enabling_science%E2%80%99s_fabled_self-correcting_nature.html">2217 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-19-The replication and criticism movement is not about suppressing speculative research; rather, it’s all about enabling science’s fabled self-correcting nature</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  points to  a post by Alex Holcombe, who disputes the idea that science is self-correcting.  Holcombe  writes  [scroll down to get to his part]:
  
The pace of scientific production has quickened, and self-correction has suffered. Findings that might correct old results are considered less interesting than results from more original research questions. Potential corrections are also more contested. As the competition for space in prestigious journals has become increasingly frenzied, doing and publishing studies that would confirm the rapidly accumulating new discoveries, or would correct them, became a losing proposition.
  
Holcombe picks up on some points that we’ve discussed a lot here in the past year.  Here’s Holcombe:
  
In certain subfields, almost all new work appears in only a very few journals, all associated with a single professional society. There is then no way around the senior gatekeepers, who may then suppress corrections with impunity. . . .

<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>3 0.88630617 <a title="2177-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-19-The_replication_and_criticism_movement_is_not_about_suppressing_speculative_research%3B_rather%2C_it%E2%80%99s_all_about_enabling_science%E2%80%99s_fabled_self-correcting_nature.html">2217 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-19-The replication and criticism movement is not about suppressing speculative research; rather, it’s all about enabling science’s fabled self-correcting nature</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>6 0.87544543 <a title="2177-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-26-Suggested_resolution_of_the_Bem_paradox.html">1139 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-26-Suggested resolution of the Bem paradox</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrew Anthony  tells the excellent story  of how Nick Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman shot down some particularly silly work in psychology.  (“According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.”  And, yes, the work they were shooting down really is that bad.)
 
If you want to see what the fuss is about, just google “2.9013.”   Here’s  an example (from 2012) of an uncritical reporting of the claim,  here’s  another one from 2010,  here’s  one from 2011 . . . well, you get the idea.
 
And  here’s a quick summary  posted by Rolf Zwaan after Brown et al. came out with their paper.
 
I know Sokal and Brown and so this story was not news to me.  I didn’t post anything about it on this blog because it seemed like it was getting enough coverage elsewhere.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  writes :
  
I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed.

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Sam Behseta, the new editor of Chance magazine, asked me if I’d like to have a column.  I said yes, I’d like to write on ethics and statistics.  My  first column  was called “Open Data and Open Methods” and I discussed the ethical obligation to share data and make our computations transparent wherever possible.  In my column, I recounted a story from a bit over 20 years ago when I noticed a problem in a published analysis (involving electromagnetic fields and calcium flow in chicken brains) and contacted the researcher in charge of the study, who would not share his data with me.
 
Two of the people from that research team—biologist Carl Blackman and statistician Dennis House—saw my Chance column and felt that I had misrepresented the situation and had criticized them unfairly.
 
Blackman and House expressed their concerns in letters to the editor which were just published, along with my reply, in the latest issue of  Chance .
 
Seeing as I posted my article here, I</p><p>5 0.92851037 <a title="2177-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-20-The_AAA_Tranche_of_Subprime_Science.html">2179 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-20-The AAA Tranche of Subprime Science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  our new ethics column for Chance , Eric Loken and I write about our current favorite topic:
  
One of our ongoing themes when discussing scientific ethics is the central role of statistics in recognizing and communicating uncer- 
tainty. Unfortunately, statistics—and the scientific process more generally—often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. . . .


We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages—that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty—were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a</p><p>6 0.92696321 <a title="2177-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-15-Static_sensitivity_analysis.html">804 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-15-Static sensitivity analysis</a></p>

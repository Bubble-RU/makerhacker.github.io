<p>Introduction: I just want to share with you the best comment we’ve every had in the nearly ten-year history of this blog.  Also it has statistical content!
 
Here’s the story.  After seeing an amusing  article  by Tom Scocca relating how reporter John Lee Anderson called someone as a “little twerp” on twitter:
 
 
 
I  conjectured  that Anderson suffered from “tall person syndrome,” that problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.
 
But I had no idea of Anderson’s actual height.  Commenter Gary  responded  with this impressive bit of investigative reporting:

<p>Introduction: The second best thing about  this story  (from Tom Scocca) is that Anderson spells “Tweets” with a capital T.
 
But the best thing is that Scocca is numerate—he compares numbers on the logarithmic scale:
  
Reminding Lake that he only had 169 Twitter followers was the saddest gambit of all. Jon Lee Anderson has 17,866 followers. And Kim Kardashian has, as I write this, 17,489,892 followers. That is: Jon Lee Anderson is 1/1,000 as important on Twitter, by his own standard, as Kim Kardashian. He is 10 times closer to Mitch Lake than he is to Kim Kardashian.
  
How often do we see a popular journalist who understands orders of magnitude?  Good job, Tom Scocca!
 
P.S.  Based on his “little twerp” comment, I also wonder if Anderson suffers from tall person syndrome—that’s the problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.

<p>Introduction: XL sent me  this paper , “A Fruitful Resolution to Simpson’s Paradox via Multi-Resolution Inference.”
 
I told Keli and Xiao-Li that I wasn’t sure I fully understood the paper—as usual, XL is subtle and sophisticated, also I only get about half of his jokes—but I sent along these thoughts:
  
1.  I do not think counterfactuals or potential outcomes are necessary for Simpson’s paradox.  I say this because one can set up Simpson’s paradox with variables that cannot be manipulated, or for which manipulations are not directly of interest.


2.  Simpson’s paradox is part of a more general issue that regression coefs change if you add more predictors, the flipping of sign is not really necessary.


Here’s an example that I use in my teaching that illustrates both points:


I can run a regression predicting income from sex and height.  I find that the coef of sex is $10,000 (i.e., comparing a man and woman of the same height, on average the man will make $10,000 more) and the coefficient of h</p><p>5 0.10710099 <a title="2250-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-23-%E2%80%9CI_mean%2C_what_exact_buttons_do_I_have_to_hit%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1995 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-23-“I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This American Life  reporter Gabriel Rhodes  says :
  
This is one of the big differences between Jon and Anthony, between scientist and non-scientist. For Jon, having a year’s worth of work suddenly thrown into question is a normal day at the office. But for Anthony, that’s not normal. And it’s not OK. The time in Jon’s lab was a year of his life, where he felt like Jon kept moving the goal posts. . . . But now, Anthony wants to know, before he starts turning his life upside down again, what will count as proof enough for Jon? How many experiments?

 
Anthony Holland:  So let’s say I do three weeks of experiment, and I only concentrate on these leukemia cells. And if I can kill at least 20% every single time, every week, will that do it? Would that be enough? Or do you want to see pancreatic die, or do you want to see—I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?
 
  
This captures a big problem with the research enterprise, as I see it.

less” than when alternative was fixed price w/ or w/o charity; and “buy more”  & “pay more” if consumer could name own price & 1/2 went to charity than if none went to charity. Pretty interesting.

I [Azhar] write with a question about language in the context of statistics. Consider the three statements below.


a) Y is significantly associated (correlated) with X;


b) knowledge of X allows us to account for __% of the variance in Y;


c) Y can be predicted to a significant extent given knowledge of X.


To what extent are these statements equivalent? Much of the (non-statistical) scientific literature doesn’t seem to distinguish between these notions. Is this just about semantics — or are there meaningful differences here, particularly between b and c?


Consider a framework where X constitutes a predictor space of p variables (x1,…,xp). We wish to generate a linear combination of these variables to yield a score that optimally correlates with Y. Can we substitute the word “predicts” for “optimally correlates with” in this context?


One can argue that “correlating” or “accounting for variance” suggests that we are trying to maximize goodness-of-fit (i</p><p>6 0.43671128 <a title="2250-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-Inventor_of_Connect_Four_dies_at_91.html">763 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-Inventor of Connect Four dies at 91</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Best blog comment  ever , following up on our post, How tall is Jon Lee Anderson?:
  
Based on this picture: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/1640569735_05337bb974.jpg he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on this picture: http://www.catalinagarcia.com/cata/Libraries/BLOG_Images/Cata_w_Jon_Lee_Anderson.sflb.ashx he appears to be about 9-10 inches taller than Catalina Garcia.


But how tall is Catalina Garcia? Not that tall – she’s shorter than the high-wire artist Phillipe Petit http://www.catalinagarcia.com/cata/Libraries/BLOG_Images/Cata_w_Philippe_Petite.sflb.ashx. And he doesn’t appear to be that tall… about the same height as Claire Danes: http://cdn.theatermania.com/photo-gallery/Petit_Danes_Daldry_2421_4700.jpg – who according to Google is 5′ 6″.


So if Jon Lee Anderson is 10″ taller than Catalina Garcia, who is 2″ shorter than Philippe Petit, who is the same height as Claire Danes, then he is 6′ 2″ tall.

<p>Introduction: From Wikipedia (via  Jay Livingston ):
  
Newsweek sells only about 40,000 newsstand copies compared with 1.5 million subscriptions.  (Both figures are substantially lower than they were a decade ago.)  The figures for Time are about double those of Newsweek, but the ratio of newsstand sales to subscriptions is about the same.

<p>Introduction: I just want to share with you the best comment we’ve every had in the nearly ten-year history of this blog.  Also it has statistical content!
 
Here’s the story.  After seeing an amusing  article  by Tom Scocca relating how reporter John Lee Anderson called someone as a “little twerp” on twitter:
 
 
 
I  conjectured  that Anderson suffered from “tall person syndrome,” that problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.
 
But I had no idea of Anderson’s actual height.  Commenter Gary  responded  with this impressive bit of investigative reporting:
  
Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on  this  picture:

<p>Introduction: This  (forwarded to me from Jeff, from a powerpoint by Willam Gawthrop) wins not on form but on content:
 
   
 
Really this graph should stand alone but it’s so wonderful that I can’t resist pointing out a few things: 
   
- The gap between 610 and 622 A.D. seems to be about the same as the previous 600 years, and only a little less than the 1400 years before that.
 
- “Pious and devout” Jews are portrayed as having steadily increased in nonviolence up to the present day.  Been to Israel lately?
 
- I assume the line labeled “Bible” is referring to Christians?  I’m sort of amazed to see pious and devout Christians listed as being maximally violent at the beginning.  Huh?  I thought Christ was supposed to be a nonviolent, mellow dude.  The line starts at 3 B.C., implying that  baby Jesus  was at the extreme of violence.
 
Gong forward, we can learn from the graph that pious and devout Christians in 1492 or 1618, say, were much more peaceful than Jesus and his crew.

<p>Introduction: In my discussion of dentists-named-Dennis study, I referred to my back-of-the-envelope  calculation  that the effect (if it indeed exists) corresponds to an approximate 1% aggregate chance that you’ll pick a profession based on your first name.  Even if there are nearly twice as many dentist Dennises as would be expected from chance alone, the base rate is so low that a shift of 1% of all Dennises would be enough to do this.  My point was that (a) even a small effect could show up when looking at low-frequency events such as the choice to pick a particular career or live in a particular city, and (b) any small effects will inherently be difficult to detect in any direct way.
 
Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the original name-choice article by Brett Pelham et al.) wrote:
  
 
In terms of the effect size. I [Simonsohn] think of it differently and see it as too big to be believable.

<p>Introduction: Around these parts we see a continuing flow of unusual claims supported by some statistical evidence.  The claims are varyingly plausible a priori.  Some examples (I won’t bother to supply the links; regular readers will remember these examples and newcomers can find them by searching):
 
- Obesity is contagious 
- People’s names affect where they live, what jobs they take, etc. 
- Beautiful people are more likely to have girl babies 
- More attractive instructors have higher teaching evaluations 
- In a basketball game, it’s better to be behind by a point at halftime than to be ahead by a point 
- Praying for someone without their knowledge improves their recovery from heart attacks 
- A variety of claims about ESP
 
How should we think about these claims?  The usual approach is to evaluate the statistical evidence–in particular, to look for reasons that the claimed results are not really statistically significant.  If nobody can shoot down a claim, it survives.

I was looking at baby name data last night and I stumbled upon something curious. I follow the  baby names blog  occasionally but not regularly, so I’m not sure if it’s been noticed before. Let me present it like this:  Take the statement…


Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.


(… You can pause and try to guess now. Spoilers to follow.)


Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier).

In this case, we’re talking about  the one-way street fallacy , which is the implicit assumption of unidirectionality in a setting that actually has underlying symmetry.
 
1.  A month or so ago we  reported  on an op-ed by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who was discussing recent research exemplified by the headline, “Study: Having daughters makes parents more likely to be Republican.”  Douthat wrote all about different effects of having girls, without realizing that the study was comparing parents of girls to parents of boys.  He just as well could have talked about the effects of having sons, and how that is associated with voting for Democrats (according to the study).  But he did not do so; he was implicitly considering boy children to be the default.

<p>Introduction: Devah Pager points me to  this article  by Uri Simonsohn, which begins:
  
Three articles published [by Brett Pelham et al.] have shown that a disproportionate share of people choose spouses, places to live, and occupations with names similar to their own. These findings, interpreted as evidence of implicit egotism, are included in most modern social psychology textbooks and many university courses. The current article successfully replicates the original findings but shows that they are most likely caused by a combination of cohort, geographic, and ethnic confounds as well as reverse causality.
  
From Simonsohn’s article, here’s a handy summary of the claims and the evidence (click on it to enlarge):

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  links  to Steve Hsu  linking  to a 1977  interview  by Katherine Sopka of physics professor Sidney Coleman.
 
I don’t know anything about Coleman’s research but the interview caught my eye because one of my roommates in grad school was one of Coleman’s advisees.
 
Anyway, here’s the key bit from the interview:
  
Sopka:  But you do enjoy working with students or do you?


Coleman:  No. I hate it. You do it as part of the job. Well, that’s of course false…or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. Occasionally there’s a student who is a joy to work with. But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students…


Sopka:  I guess your remark means then that you would like to avoid teaching undergraduate courses or even required graduate courses…


Coleman:  Or even special topics courses. Teaching is unpleasant work. No question about it. It has its rewards. One feels happy about having a job well done.

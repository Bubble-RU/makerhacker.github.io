 School sports and life outcomes 
 
An interesting case of all this came up recently in a post on  Freakonomics  that pointed to a post on  Deadspin  that pointed to a  research article .

[sent-5, score-0.475]
</p><p>2 The claim was that “sports participation [in high school] causes women to be less likely to be religious . [sent-6, score-0.922]
</p><p>3 But, as the authors of the paper (Phoebe Clarke and Ian Ayres) explain in their blog posts and the scholarly article, they’re not measuring the effects of sports participation directly. [sent-15, score-0.937]
</p><p>4 in which variation in rates of boys’ athletic participation across states before the passage of Title IX is used to instrument for changes in girls’ athletic participation following its passage . [sent-22, score-1.304]
</p><p>5 More specifically, their analysis is “comparing women in states with greater levels of 1971 male [high school] sports participation . [sent-26, score-1.289]
</p><p>6 to women in states with lower levels of 1971 male sports participation. [sent-29, score-0.862]
</p><p>7 ”  So they’re doing their best to a target their analysis on the group of women who’d be affected by the treatment. [sent-31, score-0.28]
</p><p>8 Then they run individual-level regressions on binary variables (just as a minor point, I’d prefer to keep the original ordered responses; not a big deal but it can’t hurt), but the action is all coming from the state-level predictor (the measure of male athletic participation in 1971, by state). [sent-32, score-0.579]
</p><p>9 Suppose some states were randomly selected to get the Title IX treatment and some were not. [sent-36, score-0.217]
</p><p>10 Finally, of course the interaction being studied is not random; there are systematic differences between states with higher and lower boys’ high school sports participation in 1971. [sent-41, score-1.165]
</p><p>11 Clarke and Ayres are measuring correlations and giving them a causal interpretation. [sent-44, score-0.262]
</p><p>12 As noted above, if a ten percentage-point increase in state-level female sports participation is associated with a five percentage-point increase in the proportion of women who are mothers, there’s no way that most of this can be coming from a direct effect. [sent-60, score-1.343]
</p><p>13 The implication would be that there’s this huge group of girls who (i) will have children if they do sports, and (ii) will not have children if they do not do sports. [sent-61, score-0.395]
</p><p>14 Clearly these estimated elasticities have to be driven by big differences between states that possibly have nothing to do with high school sports. [sent-62, score-0.404]
</p><p>15 Finally, if you’re interested in the substantive questions about the effects of sports participation, I think it’s essential to make a connection to whatever is already known in this field. [sent-69, score-0.461]
</p><p>16 Sure, survey data have their limitations:  as Clarke and Ayres note, kids select into sports participation. [sent-70, score-0.397]
</p><p>17 The article includes the following footnote:    It is true that many successful women with professional careers, such as Sheryl Sandberg and Brandi Chastain, are married. [sent-75, score-0.201]
</p><p>18 Women who participate in sports may “reject marriage” by getting divorces when they find themselves in unhappy marriages. [sent-77, score-0.397]
</p><p>19 It may well be true that, at the individual level, “sports participation causes women to be less religious, more likely to have children, and, if they do have children, more likely to be single mothers,” even if the actual effects are an order of magnitude lower than claimed. [sent-85, score-1.122]
</p><p>20 Recall that if we were studying state-level correlations of income and voting, we’d come to the false conclusion that poor people are more likely to vote Republican. [sent-87, score-0.193]

<p>Introduction: Karl Broman  writes :
  
I [Karl] personally would avoid sports entirely, as I view the subject to be insufficiently serious. . . . Certainly lots of statisticians are interested in sports. . . . And I’m not completely uninterested in sports: I like to watch football, particularly Nebraska, Green Bay, and Baltimore, and to see Notre Dame or any team from Florida or Texas lose.


But statistics about sports? Yawn.
  
As a person who loves sports, statistics, and sports statistics, I have a few thoughts:
 
1.  Not everyone likes sports, and even fewer are interested in any particular sport.  It’s ok to use sports examples, but don’t delude yourself into thinking that everyone in the class cares about it.
 
2.  Don’t forget foreign students.  A lot of them don’t even know the rules of kickball, fer chrissake!
 
3.  Of the students who care about a sport, there will be a minority who  really  care.  We had some serious basketball fans in our class last year.

<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Our statistics book made it possible for Kruschke to write his excellent book for psycholo</p><p>4 0.15625063 <a title="2336-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?  It depends on the size of the treatment interactions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class. I really *hope* you why that is an absurd criticism – especially of au</p><p>5 0.14213163 <a title="2336-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>3 0.80998689 <a title="2336-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-08-The_Supreme_Court_meets_the_fallacy_of_the_one-sided_bet.html">1793 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-08-The Supreme Court meets the fallacy of the one-sided bet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.

<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok with a good  catch :
  
In  Why Don’t Women Patent? , a recent NBER paper, Jennifer Hunt et al. [Jean-Philippe Garant, Hannah Herman, and David Munroe] present a stark fact: Only 5.5% of the holders of commercialized patents are women. One might think that this is explained by the relative lack of women with science and engineering degrees but Hunt et al. find that “women with such a degree are scarcely more likely to patent than women without.” Instead, most of the difference is “accounted for by differences among those with a science or engineering degree” especially the fact that women are underrepresented in patent-intensive fields such as electrical and mechanical engineering and in development and design.


Predictably, the authors do not ask why women might self-selection into non patent-intensive fields, perhaps because this would require at least a discussion of  politically incorrect questions . The failure to investigate these questions leads to some dubious co</p><p>6 0.79180211 <a title="2336-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: José Iparraguirre writes:
  
I’ve read  a recent paper  by the International Monetary Fund on the effects of fiscal consolidation measures on income inequality (Fiscal Monitor October 2012, Appendix 1).


They run a panel regression with 48 countries and 30 years (annual data) of a measure of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on a number of covariates, including a measure of fiscal consolidation.


Footnote 39 (page 51) informs that they’ve employed seemingly unrelated regression and panel-corrected standard errors, and that to double-check they’ve also run ordinary least squares and fixed-effects panel regressions—all with similar results.


So far, so good. However, the footnote goes on to explain that “Some of the results (e.g. the causal relationship between consolidation and inequality) may be subject to endogeneity and should be interpreted with caution”. (Italics are mine).


Therefore, it seems that the crux of the exercise—i.e. estimating the relationship between fiscal con</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97473115 <a title="2336-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-16-How_much_can_we_learn_about_individual-level_causal_claims_from_state-level_correlations%3F.html">2336 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-16-How much can we learn about individual-level causal claims from state-level correlations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, we all know the answer:  “correlation does not imply causation”—but of course life is more complicated than that.  As philosophers, economists, statisticians, and others have repeatedly noted, most of our information about the world is observational not experimental, yet we manage to draw causal conclusions all the time.  Sure, some of these conclusions are wrong (more often than 5% of the time, I’m sure) but that’s an accepted part of life.
 
Challenges in this regard arise in the design of a study, in the statistical analysis, in how you write it up for a peer-reviewed journal, and finally in how you present it to the world.
 
 School sports and life outcomes 
 
An interesting case of all this came up recently in a post on  Freakonomics  that pointed to a post on  Deadspin  that pointed to a  research article .

I have read an  article  on NPR and the  journal article  that spun this news.  


What draw my attention was the discussion in terms of causation implied by one of the authors of the article interviewed in the NPR news, and also by the conclusions of the article itself claiming large effects.


Although the total sample (self-selecting pregnant women) seems very large (85,176) the subsamples (270 out of which 114 were in the sub-subsample revealing statistically significant association) used to support the analysis seem to be too small. Or not?
  
My response:
 
The different sources of information do seem to be in some conflict:

<p>Introduction: Bob told me the other day (the other week, actually, as I’m stacking up posts here with a roughly one-month delay) that I shouldn’t try to compete with the electrical engineers when it comes to length of C.V.:  according to Bob, these dudes can have over two  thousand  publications!
 
How do they do it?  First, an EE prof will have tons of graduate students and postdocs, they’re all writing papers and presenting at conferences,  and they all stick his name on the author list.  Second, these students and postdocs write up and publish  every experiment they do .  Including (especially!) computer experiments.
 
And . . . all these people writing paper cite each other, so they quickly rack up thousands of citations.
 
Upon hearing this, my first reaction to this was fear, plain and simple.  One of the distinguishing characteristics of my own research record is that I have so many publications and citations.

<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar  writes :
  
While bike theft is an epidemic in major US cities, most people seem resigned that it’s just a fact of life. . . . at Priceonomics, we thought we’d take a crack at trying to reduce bike theft. Could we use software to help people fight back against bike thieves?


Professional bike thieves exist because they can make a profit. Luckily, this author went to business school and remembers exactly one equation from the experience:


Profit = Revenue – Cost


From a criminal’s perspective, the “Cost” of bike theft is about zero. The odds of getting caught are negligible and the penalty is about zero as well. Most commentators suggest that in order to prevent bike theft, the government should increase the penalties to make it a less attractive crime. As we stated earlier, we somehow doubt government intervention is going to happen any time soon.


We decided to focus on the revenue half of the equation. Could we make it harder for bike thieves to turn their contraband</p><p>3 0.11342504 <a title="2271-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Online_Education_and_Jazz.html">1752 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Online Education and Jazz</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>6 0.095606074 <a title="2271-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-My_proposal_for_making_college_admissions_fairer.html">93 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-My proposal for making college admissions fairer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I encountered this  news article , “Chicago school bans some lunches brought from home”:
  
At Little Village, most students must take the meals served in the cafeteria or go hungry or both. . . . students are not allowed to pack lunches from home. Unless they have a medical excuse, they must eat the food served in the cafeteria. . . . Such discussions over school lunches and healthy eating echo a larger national debate about the role government should play in individual food choices.  “This is such a fundamental infringement on parental responsibility,” said J. Justin Wilson, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Center for Consumer Freedom, which is partially funded by the food industry. . . . For many CPS parents, the idea of forbidding home-packed lunches would be unthinkable. . . . 
  
If I had read this two years ago, I’d be at one with J. Justin Wilson and the outraged kids and parents.  But last year we spent a sabbatical in Paris, where . . . kids aren’t allowed to bring</p><p>3 0.73001814 <a title="2271-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood_in_the_math_curriculum.html">992 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood in the math curriculum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.


I started asking hardcore math people — mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, rocket scientists — if they.’d ever u</p><p>4 0.71422851 <a title="2271-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-06-Followup_questions.html">452 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-06-Followup questions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Upon returning from sabbatical I came across a few magazines from a year ago that I hadn’t gotten around to reading.  I’m thinking that I should read everything on a one-year delay.  The too-topical stuff (for example, promos tied to upcoming movies) I can ignore, and other items are enhanced by knowing what happened a year or two later.
 
For example, the 11 May 2009 issue of the New Yorker featured  an article  by Douglas McGray about an organization in Los Angeles called Green Dot that runs charter schools.  According to the article, Green Dot, unlike typical charter school operators, educate just about everyone in their schools’ areas and so don’t benefit so much from  selection .  I don’t know enough about the details to evaluate these claims, but I was curious about this bit:
  
[L.A. schools superintendent] Cortines has also agreed in principle to a partnership in Los Angeles. . . . Green Dot could take over as many as five Los Angeles schools in 2010, and maybe more.

<p>Introduction: Sharon Otterman  reports :
  
When report card grades were released in the fall for the city’s 455 high schools, the highest score went to a small school in a down-and-out section of the Bronx . . . A stunning 94 percent of its seniors graduated, more than 30 points above the citywide average. . . . “When I interviewed for the school,” said Sam Buchbinder, a history teacher, “it was made very clear: this is a school that doesn’t believe in anyone failing.”


That statement was not just an exhortation to excellence. It was school policy.


By order of the principal, codified in the school’s teacher handbook, all teachers should grade their classes in the same way: 30 percent of students should earn a grade in the A range, 40 percent B’s, 25 percent C’s, and no more than 5 percent D’s. As long as they show up, they should not fail.

<p>Introduction: I was unlocking my bike, with music turned on low, and a couple of high school kids were lounging around nearby.  One of them walked over and asked, « Qui est-ce qui chante? ». I responded, “Stevie Wonder” (not trying any accent on this one).  The kid said, « Ees good ».</p><p>2 0.8478905 <a title="2271-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-14-Learning_how_to_speak.html">1938 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-14-Learning how to speak</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>3 0.84210515 <a title="2271-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-08-Econ_debate_about_prices_at_a_fancy_restaurant.html">1105 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-08-Econ debate about prices at a fancy restaurant</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon  writes :
  
Economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson  have a problem  with Grant Achatz’s pricing strategy at Next, where tickets are sold at a fixed price and are then free to be resold at an enormous markup on the secondary market . . .

 
“It’s democratic in theory, but not in practice,” said Wolfers . . .


If a person can sell a ticket for $3,000, the true cost of going to the restaurant — what an economist would call the opportunity cost — is $3000, because that’s how much money the person is giving up for the meal.
 

Bloomberg’s Mark Whitehouse concludes that Next should “consider selling tickets to the highest bidder and giving the extra money to charity” . . .
  
What strikes me is how weird this discussion is.  Why should this restaurant owner have some sort of moral obligation to maximize his income and then donate to charity?  For one thing, if he really did make more money off the deal he might just keep it.  But more to the point, this sort of maximiz</p><p>4 0.83961463 <a title="2271-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-A_calibrated_Cook_gives_Dems_the_edge_in_Nov%2C_sez_Sandy.html">300 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-A calibrated Cook gives Dems the edge in Nov, sez Sandy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>5 0.8344695 <a title="2271-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-12-Election_symposium_at_Columbia_Journalism_School.html">337 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-12-Election symposium at Columbia Journalism School</a></p>

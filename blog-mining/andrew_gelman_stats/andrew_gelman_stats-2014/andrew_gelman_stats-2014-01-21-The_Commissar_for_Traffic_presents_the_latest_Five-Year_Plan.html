Phil Price points us to  this  news article by Clark Williams-Derry:
  
As the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin points out, the US Department of Transportation has been making the virtually identical vehicle travel forecasts for well over a decade. All of those forecasts project rapid and incessant growth in vehicle travel for as far as the eye can see. Meanwhile, actual traffic volumes have flattened out, and may actually be falling.


 


Each of the rising colored lines represents a forecast from a different year.  The black line represents actual traffic trends on US roads—which never rose as quickly as the forecasters had predicted, and actually started a modest decline in 2007.
  
I’d like to see a label on the y-axis, and I’d recommend labeling the x-axis at 5-year intervals rather than every year, but the point seems pretty clear.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko is  irritated  by the Times’s refusal to retract a recounting of a hoax regarding Dickens and Dostoevsky.  All I can say is, the Times refuses to retract mistakes of fact that are far more current than that!   See here  for two examples that particularly annoyed me, to the extent that I contacted various people at the Times but ran into refusals to retract.
 
I guess a daily newspaper publishes so much material that they can’t be expected to run a retraction every time they publish something false, even when such things are brought to their attention.
 
Speaking of corrections, I wonder if later editions of the Samuelson economics textbook discussed their notorious  graph  predicting Soviet economic performance.  The easiest thing would be just to remove the graph, but I think it would be a better economics lesson to discuss the error!
 
Similarly, I think the NYT would do well to run an article on their Dickens-Dostoevsky mistake, along with a column by Arthur Brooks on how</p><p>3 0.12645371 <a title="2181-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-03-Some_thoughts_on_election_forecasting.html">391 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-03-Some thoughts on election forecasting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc., or see here for a  more technical paper  with Kari Lock) but had a few things to add in light of Sam Wang’s  recent efforts . As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.  I</p><p>4 0.12562007 <a title="2181-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-Comparison_of_forecasts_for_the_2010_congressional_elections.html">270 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-Comparison of forecasts for the 2010 congressional elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>5 0.11432038 <a title="2181-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-02-Roads%2C_traffic%2C_and_the_importance_in_decision_analysis_of_carefully_examining_your_goals.html">988 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-02-Roads, traffic, and the importance in decision analysis of carefully examining your goals</a></p>

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>3 0.75419611 <a title="2181-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-Politics_is_not_a_random_walk%3A__Momentum_and_mean_reversion_in_polling.html">364 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-Politics is not a random walk:  Momentum and mean reversion in polling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.

Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>4 0.74014264 <a title="2181-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-02-Selection_bias%2C_or%2C_How_you_can_think_the_experts_don%E2%80%99t_check_their_models%2C_if_you_simply_don%E2%80%99t_look_at_what_the_experts_actually_are_doing.html">1295 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-02-Selection bias, or, How you can think the experts don’t check their models, if you simply don’t look at what the experts actually are doing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.

<p>Introduction: Jeff the Productivity Sapper points me to  this insulting open letter to Nate Silver  written by pollster John Zogby.  I’ll go through bits of Zogby’s note line by line.  (Conflict of interest warning:  I have collaborated with Nate and I blog on his site).
  
Zogby writes:  Here is some advice from someone [Zogby] who has been where you [Silver] are today.
  
Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.

Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.

<p>Introduction: What do Paul Samuelson and the U.S. Department of Transportation have in common?
 
Phil Price points us to  this  news article by Clark Williams-Derry:
  
As the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin points out, the US Department of Transportation has been making the virtually identical vehicle travel forecasts for well over a decade. All of those forecasts project rapid and incessant growth in vehicle travel for as far as the eye can see. Meanwhile, actual traffic volumes have flattened out, and may actually be falling.


 


Each of the rising colored lines represents a forecast from a different year.  The black line represents actual traffic trends on US roads—which never rose as quickly as the forecasters had predicted, and actually started a modest decline in 2007.
  
I’d like to see a label on the y-axis, and I’d recommend labeling the x-axis at 5-year intervals rather than every year, but the point seems pretty clear.
 
Williams-Derry continues:</p><p>2 0.88845098 <a title="2181-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-22-Researching_the_cost-effectiveness_of_political_lobbying_organisations.html">969 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-22-Researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.

<p>Introduction: Much-honored playwright Tony Kushner was set to receive one more honor–a degree from John Jay College–but it was suddenly  taken away  from him on an 11-1 vote of the trustees  of the City University of New York.  This was the first rejection of an honorary degree nomination since 1961.
 
The news article focuses on one trustee, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment adviser and onetime political aide, who opposed Kushner’s honorary degree, but to me the relevant point is that the committee as a whole voted 11-1 to ding him.
 
Kusnher said, “I’m sickened,” he added, “that this is happening in New York City. Shocked, really.”  I can see why he’s shocked, but perhaps it’s not so surprising that it’s happening in NYC.  Recall the famous incident from 1940 in which Bertrand Russell was invited and then uninvited to teach at City College.  The problem that time was Russell’s views on free love (as they called it back then).  There seems to be a long tradition of city college officials being will</p><p>4 0.88312656 <a title="2181-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-24-In_case_you_were_wondering%2C_here%E2%80%99s_the_price_of_milk.html">588 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-24-In case you were wondering, here’s the price of milk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seeing Sarah Palin’s recent  witticism :
  
It’s no wonder Michelle Obama is telling everybody you need to breast feed your babies … the price of milk is so high!
  
I was reminded of Dan Quayle’s quip during the 1988 campaign:
  
The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber ducky drowned in the bathtub.
  
And this got me wondering:  how often do legitimate political figures–not talk show hosts, but actual politicians–communicate via schoolyard-style taunts?
  

 
I’m not talking here about dry wit of the Bob Dole or Morris Udall variety, or political gamesmanship such as Ronald Reagan’s “make my day,” or flat-out partisanship like Alan Grayson’s “the Republicans want you to die quickly” or James Watt’s line about “liberals and Americans.”  It’s gotta be an actual joke.
 
There must be some other examples of Palin/Quayle style humor, but I’m not sure where to look.
 
I keep thinking of Veronica Geng’s hilarious story which includes the line:

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll [yes, I've learned how to smoothly do this using alt-o] gives  some writing advice :
  
What gives a text presence is our commitment to asserting facts. We have to face the possibility that we may be wrong about them resolutely, and we do this by writing about them as though we are right.
  
This and an earlier  remark  by Basbøll are closely related in my mind to predictive model checking and to  Bayesian statistics :  we make strong assumptions and then engage the data and the assumptions in a dialogue:  assumptions + data -> inference, and we can then compare the inference to the data which can reveal problems with our model (or problems with the data, but that’s really problems with the model too, in this case problems with the model for the data).
 
I like the idea that a condition for a story to be useful is that we put some belief into it.  (One doesn’t put belief into a joke.)  And also the converse, that thnking hard about a story and believing it can be the pre</p><p>6 0.88144928 <a title="2181-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-18-Should_kids_be_able_to_bring_their_own_lunches_to_school%3F.html">718 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-18-Should kids be able to bring their own lunches to school?</a></p>

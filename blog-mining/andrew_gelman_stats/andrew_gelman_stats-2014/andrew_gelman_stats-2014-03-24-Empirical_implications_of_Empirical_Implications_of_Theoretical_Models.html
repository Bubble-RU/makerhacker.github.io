<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>3 0.24055031 <a title="2263-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed_or_two-tailed%3F.html">2295 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed or two-tailed?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo quotes me as saying, “Popper has argued (convincingly, in my opinion) that scientific inference is not inductive but deductive.”  She then  follows up  with:
  
Gelman employs significance test-type reasoning to reject a model when the data sufficiently disagree.


Now, strictly speaking, a model falsification, even to inferring something as weak as “the model breaks down,” is not purely deductive, but Gelman is right to see it as about as close as one can get, in statistics, to a deductive falsification of a model. But where does that leave him as a Jaynesian?
  
My reply:
 
I was influenced by reading a toy example from Jaynes’s book where he sets up a model (for the probability of a die landing on each of its six sides) based on first principles, then presents some data that contradict the model, then expands the model.
 
I’d seen very little of this sort of this reasoning before in statistics!  In physics it’s the standard way to go:  you set up a model based on physic</p><p>5 0.20325148 <a title="2263-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-04-The_Notorious_N.H.S.T._presents%3A__Mo_P-values_Mo_Problems.html">2281 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-04-The Notorious N.H.S.T. presents:  Mo P-values Mo Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.

Despite the myriad rules and procedures of science, some research findings are pure flukes. Perhaps you’re testing a new drug, and by chance alone, a large number of people spontaneously get better. The better your study is conducted, the lower the chance that your result was a fluke – but still, there is always a certain probability that it was.


Statistical significance testing gives you an idea of what this probability is.


In science we’re always testing hypotheses. We never conduct a study to ‘see what happens’, because there’s always at least one way to make any useless set of data look important.

I [Seaver] happened to be reading an ironic  article  by Karl Friston when I learned something new about frequentist vs bayesian, namely Lindley’s paradox, on page 12.  The text is as follows:

 
So why are we worried about trivial effects? They are important because the probability that the true effect size is exactly zero is itself zero and could cause us to reject the null hypothesis inappropriately. This is a fallacy of classical inference and is not unrelated to Lindley’s paradox (Lindley 1957). Lindley’s paradox describes a counterintuitive situation in which Bayesian and frequentist approaches to hypothesis testing give opposite results. It occurs when; (i) a result is significant by a frequentist test, indicating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis d=0 and (ii) priors render the posterior probability of d=0 high, indicating strong evidence that the null hypothesis is true. In his original 
treatment, Lindley (1957) showed that – under a parti</p><p>6 0.84369814 <a title="2263-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-23-Of_hypothesis_tests_and_Unitarians.html">1024 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-23-Of hypothesis tests and Unitarians</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aki and I  write :
  
The very generality of the boostrap creates both opportunity and peril, allowing researchers to solve otherwise intractable problems but also sometimes leading to an answer with an inappropriately high level of certainty.


We demonstrate with two examples from our own research:  one problem where bootstrap smoothing was effective and led us to an improved method, and another case where bootstrap smoothing would not solve the underlying problem.  Our point in these examples is not to disparage bootstrapping but rather to gain insight into where it will be more or less effective as a smoothing tool.


 An example where bootstrap smoothing works well

 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables). Bayesian inference involves calculating the objective degree of plausibility of a hypothesis (typically the truth value of the hypothesis is a function of the variables mentioned above) given such a</p><p>3 0.9865402 <a title="2263-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding_the_p-value.html">1760 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding the p-value</a></p>

Today’s  column , by Nicholas Balakar, is in error.  The column begins:
  
When medical researchers report their findings, they need to know whether their result is a real effect of what they are testing, or just a random occurrence. To figure this out, they most commonly use the p-value.
  
This is wrong on two counts.  First, whatever researchers might feel, this is something they’ll never know.  Second, results are a combination of real effects and chance, it’s not either/or.
 
Perhaps the above is a forgivable simplification, but I don’t think so; I think it’s a simplification that destroys the reason for writing the article in the first place.  But in any case I think there’s no excuse for this, later on:

My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Robert Bloomfield writes:
  
Most of the people in my field (accounting, which is basically applied economics and finance, leavened with psychology and organizational behavior) use ‘positive research methods’, which are typically described as coming to the data with a predefined theory, and using hypothesis testing to accept or reject the theory’s predictions.  But a substantial minority use ‘interpretive research methods’ (sometimes called qualitative methods, for those that call positive research ‘quantitative’).  No one seems entirely happy with the definition of this method, but I’ve found it useful to think of it as an attempt to see the world through the eyes of your subjects, much as Jane Goodall lived with gorillas and tried to see the world through their eyes.)

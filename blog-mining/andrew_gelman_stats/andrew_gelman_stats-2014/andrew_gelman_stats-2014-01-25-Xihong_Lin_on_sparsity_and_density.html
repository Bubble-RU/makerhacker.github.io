<p>Introduction: Rob Tibshirani  writes :
  
Hastie et al. (2001) coined the informal “Bet on Sparsity” principle. The l1 methods assume that the truth is sparse, in some basis. If the assumption holds true, then the parameters can be efficiently estimated using l1 penalties. If the assumption does not hold—so that the truth is dense—then no method will be able to recover the underlying model without a large amount of data per parameter.
  
I’ve earlier  expressed  my full and sincere appreciation for Hastie and Tibshirani’s work in this area.
 
Now I’d like to briefly comment on the above snippet.  The question is, how do we think about the “bet on sparsity” principle in a world where the truth  is  dense?  I’m thinking here of social science, where no effects are clean and no coefficient is zero (see page 960 of  this article  or various blog discussions in the past few years), where every contrast is meaningful—but some of these contrasts might be lost in the noise with any realistic size of data.</p><p>3 0.12644647 <a title="2185-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-04-Honored_oldsters_write_about_statistics.html">2317 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-04-Honored oldsters write about statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The new book titled: Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science is now  available for download .
 
The official description makes the book sound pretty stuffy:
  
Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science, commissioned by the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) to celebrate its 50th anniversary and the International Year of Statistics, will be published in April by Taylor & Francis/CRC Press. Through the contributions of a distinguished group of 50 statisticians, the book showcases the breadth and vibrancy of statistics, describes current challenges and new opportunities, highlights the exciting future of statistical science, and provides guidance for future statisticians. Contributors are past COPSS award honorees.
  
But it actually has lots of good stuff, including the chapter by Tibshirani which I  discussed  last year (in the context of the “bet on sparsity principle”), and chapters by XL and other fun people.

<p>Introduction: On the side of less regulation is  Alex Tabarrok  in “Our DNA, Our Selves”:
  
At the same time that the NSA is secretly and illegally obtaining information about Americans the FDA is making it illegal for Americans to obtain information about themselves. 
In a warning letter the FDA has told Anne Wojcicki, The Most Daring CEO In America, that she “must immediately discontinue” selling 23andMe’s Personal Genome Service . . .
  
Alex clarifies:
  
I am not offended by all regulation of genetic tests. Indeed, genetic tests are already regulated. . . . the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) . . . requires all labs, including the labs used by 23andMe, to be inspected for quality control, record keeping and the qualifications of their personnel. . . .


What the FDA wants to do is categorically different.

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis, a medical scientist perhaps best known for his  controversial  claim (see also  here ), based on joint work with James Fowler, that obesity is contagious,  writes : 
  
  
The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .


I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomen</p><p>3 0.63358146 <a title="2185-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-01-Why_big_effects_are_more_important_than_small_effects.html">1744 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-01-Why big effects are more important than small effects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this post is silly but I have an important point to make, regarding an implicit model which I think many people assume even though it does not really make sense.
 
Following a link from Sanjay Srivastava, I came across  a post  from David Funder saying that it’s useful to talk about the sizes of effects (I actually prefer the term “comparisons” so as to avoid the causal baggage) rather than just their signs.  I  agree , and I wanted to elaborate a bit on a point that comes up in Funder’s discussion.  He quotes an (unnamed) prominent social psychologist as writing:
  
The key to our research . . . [is not] to accurately estimate effect size. If I were testing an advertisement for a marketing research firm and wanted to be sure that the cost of the ad would produce enough sales to make it worthwhile, effect size would be crucial. But when I am testing a theory about whether, say, positive mood reduces information processing in comparison with negative mood, I am worried abou</p><p>4 0.62614602 <a title="2185-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-31-Social_scientists_who_use_medical_analogies_to_explain_causal_inference_are%2C_I_think%2C_implicitly_trying_to_borrow_some_of_the_scientific_and_cultural_authority_of_that_field_for_our_own_purposes.html">1555 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-31-Social scientists who use medical analogies to explain causal inference are, I think, implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m sorry I don’t have any new zombie papers in time for Halloween.  Instead I’d like to be a little monster by reproducing a mini-rant from  this article  on experimental reasoning in social science:
  
I will restrict my discussion to social science examples. Social scientists are often tempted to illustrate their ideas with examples from medical research. When it comes to medicine, though, we are, with rare exceptions, at best ignorant laypersons (in my case, not even reaching that level), and it is my impression that by reaching for medical analogies we are implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes. Evidence-based medicine is the subject of a large literature of its own (see, for example, Lau, Ioannidis, and Schmid, 1998).</p><p>5 0.62454844 <a title="2185-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-30-%E2%80%9CPresidential_Election_Outcomes_Directly_Influence_Suicide_Rates%E2%80%9D.html">382 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-30-“Presidential Election Outcomes Directly Influence Suicide Rates”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This came in the spam the other day:
  
College Station, TX–August 16, 2010–Change and hope were central themes to the November 2008 U.S. presidential election. A new longitudinal study published in the September issue of  Social Science Quarterly   analyzes suicide rates at a state level from 1981ï¼2005 and determines that presidential election outcomes directly influence suicide rates among voters.


In states where the majority of voters supported the national election winner suicide rates decreased. However, counter-intuitively, suicide rates decreased even more dramatically in states where the majority of voters supported the election loser (4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 lower for females). This article is the first in its field to focus on candidate and state-specific outcomes in relation to suicide rates. Prior research on this topic focused on whether the election process itself influenced suicide rates, and found that suicide rates fell during the election season.

<p>Introduction: I pointed Xihong Lin to  this post  from last month regarding Hastie and Tibshirani’s “bet on sparsity principle.”  I argued that, in the worlds in which I work, in social and environmental science, every contrast is meaningful, even if not all of them can be distinguished from noise given a particular dataset.  That is, I claim that effects are dense but data can be sparse—and any apparent sparsity of effects is typically just an artifact of sparsity of data.
 
But things might be different in other fields.  Xihong had an interesting perspective in the application areas where she works:
  
Sparsity and density both appear in genetic studies too. For example, ethnicity has effects across millions of genetic variants across the genome (dense). Disease associated genetic variants are sparse.</p><p>2 0.83605802 <a title="2185-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-%E2%80%9CGenomics%E2%80%9D_vs._genetics.html">303 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-“Genomics” vs. genetics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>3 0.83304101 <a title="2185-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-07-Diabetes_stops_at_the_state_line%3F.html">454 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-07-Diabetes stops at the state line?</a></p>

 Razib Khan  asks:
  
But follow the gradient from El Paso to the Illinois-Missouri border. The differences are small across state lines, but the consistent differences along the borders really don’t make. Are there state-level policies or regulations causing this? Or, are there state-level differences in measurement? This weird pattern shows up in other CDC data I’ve seen.

  
Turns out that CDC isn’t providing  data , they’re providing  model . Frank Howland answered: 
  

I suspect the answer has to do with the manner in which the county estimates are produced. I went to the original data source, the CDC, and then to the  relevant FAQ .


There they say that the diabetes prevalence estimates come from the “CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program. The BRFSS is an ongoing, monthly, state-based telephone survey of the adult population. The survey provides state-specific informati</p><p>4 0.82034069 <a title="2185-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-29-Data_mining_and_allergies.html">685 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-29-Data mining and allergies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all this data floating around, there are some interesting analyses one can do. I came across  “The Association of Tree Pollen Concentration Peaks and Allergy Medication Sales in New York City: 2003-2008″  by  Perry Sheffield . There they correlate pollen counts with anti-allergy medicine sales – and indeed find that two days after high pollen counts, the medicine sales are the highest.
 
 
 
Of course, it would be interesting to play with the data to see *what* tree is actually causing the sales to increase the most. Perhaps this would help the arborists what trees to plant. At the moment they seem to be following  a rather sexist approach  to tree planting:
  

Ogren says the city could solve the problem by planting only female trees, which don’t produce pollen like male trees do.


City arborists shy away from females because many produce messy – or in the case of ginkgos, smelly – fruit that litters sidewalks.


In Ogren’s opinion, that’s a mistake. He says the females only pro</p><p>5 0.81663048 <a title="2185-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-12-The_power_of_the_puzzlegraph.html">1669 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-12-The power of the puzzlegraph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  reports  that the following project from Krisztina Szucs and Mate Cziner has won their visualization challenge, “launched in September 2012 to solicit visualisations based on the OECD’s data-rich Education at a Glance report”:

From the press release:
  
Entries from around the world focused on data related to the economic costs and return on investment in education . . . [The winning entry] takes a detailed look at public vs. private and men vs. women for selected countries . . .


The judges were particularly impressed by the angled slope format of the visualisation, which encourages comparison between the upper-secondary and tertiary benefits of education. Szucs and Cziner were also lauded for  their striking visual design, which draws users into exploring their piece  [emphasis added].

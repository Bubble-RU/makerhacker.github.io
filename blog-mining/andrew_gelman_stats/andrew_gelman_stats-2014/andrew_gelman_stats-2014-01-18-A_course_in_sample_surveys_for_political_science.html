<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>3 0.21616891 <a title="2175-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-02-My_course_this_fall_on_l%E2%80%99analyse_bay%C3%A9sienne_de_donn%C3%A9es.html">1965 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-02-My course this fall on l’analyse bayésienne de données</a></p>
<p>Introduction: X marks the  spot .  I’ll post the slides soon (not just for the students in my class; these should be helpful for anyone teaching Bayesian data analysis from  our book ).

<p>Introduction: We had 28 class periods, so I wrote an exam with an approximate correspondence of one question per class.  Rather than dumping the exam in your lap all at once, I’ll post the questions once per day.  Then each day I’ll post the answer to yesterday’s questions.  So it will be 29 days in all.  I’ll post them to appear late in the day so as not to interfere with our main daily posts (which are currently backed up to early June).
 
The course was offered in the political science department and covered a mix of statistical and political topics.  Followers of our  recent discussion  on test questions won’t be surprised to learn that some of the questions are ambiguous.  This wasn’t on purpose.  I tried my best, but good questions are hard to write.
 
Question 1 will appear tomorrow.</p><p>5 0.20609796 <a title="2175-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-03-A_question_for_psychometricians.html">313 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-03-A question for psychometricians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Don Coffin writes:
  
A colleague of mine and I are doing a presentation for new faculty on a number of topics related to teaching.  Our charge is to identify interesting issues and to find research-based information for them about how to approach things.  So, what I wondered is, do you know of any published research dealing with the sort of issues about structuring a course and final exam in the ways you talk about in  this blog post ?  Some poking around in the usual places hasn’t turned anything up yet.
  
I don’t really know the psychometrics literature but I imagine that some good stuff has been written on principles of test design. There are probably some good papers from back in the 1920s.  Can anyone supply some references?</p><p>6 0.14828119 <a title="2175-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-08-chartsnthings_%21.html">1308 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-08-chartsnthings !</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.

<p>Introduction: A colleague asked if I had any material for a course in sample surveys.  And indeed I do.   See here .
 
It’s all the slides for a 14-week course, also the syllabus (“surveyscourse.pdf”), the final exam (“final2012.pdf”) and various misc files. Also more discussion of final exam questions  here  (keep scrolling thru the “previous entries” until you get to Question 1).
 
Enjoy!  This is in no way a self-contained teach-it-yourself course, but I do think it could be helpful for anyone who is trying to teach a class on this material.</p><p>2 0.9168638 <a title="2175-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-14-BDA_class_G%2B_hangout_another_try.html">2100 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-14-BDA class G+ hangout another try</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30 (Paris time) I will be teaching my Bayesian Data Analysis  class  (class4a.pdf and class4b.pdf, you can follow the slides  here ).
 
We had  problems  earlier with the regular G+ hangout, so this time we’re trying the G+ On-Air Hangout which I think should work better.
 
I’ll post a blog entry tomorrow with a link to the hangout.  Let’s hope for the best!</p><p>3 0.87512416 <a title="2175-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t_think_of_it_as_duplication._Think_of_it_as_a_single_paper_in_a_superposition_of_two_quantum_journals.%E2%80%9D.html">1654 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-“Don’t think of it as duplication.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>4 0.87299055 <a title="2175-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-10-Presenting_at_the_econ_seminar.html">1050 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-10-Presenting at the econ seminar</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Savage saw  this  and pointed me to  this  video.  I didn’t actually look at it, but given that it is labeled, “For new econ Ph.D.’s about to look for a job . . . what you might expect when you give your first talk presenting your research,” I can pretty much guess what it’ll look like.</p><p>5 0.87217933 <a title="2175-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-18-G%2B_hangout_for_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_course_now%21_%28actually%2C_in_5_minutes%29.html">2068 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-18-G+ hangout for Bayesian Data Analysis course now!

<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?  Thanks.</p><p>6 0.86856806 <a title="2175-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>

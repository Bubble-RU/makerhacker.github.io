[sent-18, score-0.441]
</p><p>2 On the left, people think that 100% of working-class people should vote for the left, so anything less than 100% makes them feel that there is something that went wrong. [sent-21, score-0.647]
</p><p>3 Another way of saying this is that if you compare people’s attitudes from surveys in Republican-leaning states to Democrat-leaning states, low-income people don’t differ much, on average, in their social and economic attitudes. [sent-47, score-0.509]
</p><p>4 In Republican states they tend to be very conservative on economic issues and moderate on social issues. [sent-50, score-0.52]
</p><p>5 In Democrat-leaning states, upper-middle-class or rich people tend to be moderately conservative on economics and liberal on social issues. [sent-51, score-0.616]
</p><p>6 If he’s talking about a place where people vote for Democrats, it always seems to be a declining, rust-belt, corrupt area, and when it’s an area that’s voting for Republicans, it’s always a dynamic, exciting part of the country. [sent-81, score-0.675]
</p><p>7 OK, I’ll look up the part of New York state I live in, because I’ve always wondered about the political attitudes of the people around me. [sent-102, score-0.574]
</p><p>8 When they posted the election results after election day, there were a certain number of people who voted for Franklin Roosevelt, the Democrat, and a certain number of people who voted for Alf Landon the Republican, and then there was one vote for the Communist. [sent-110, score-0.965]
</p><p>9 One is people where they know who they’re going to vote for, but they’re not sure that they’re going to vote. [sent-129, score-0.565]
</p><p>10 If they think you’re already likely to vote for a certain candidate, they’ll try to find somebody to knock on your door and convince you that it’s an important election and it’s worth voting for. [sent-135, score-0.49]
</p><p>11 Or attitudes about economic issues – Americans are more economically conservative and more socially liberal than they used to be. [sent-166, score-0.49]
</p><p>12 But on issues that people have thought about, people have fairly sensible views. [sent-174, score-0.499]
</p><p>13 Even if people get a lot of the facts wrong – and you can certainly do survey after survey, where you see people getting the facts wrong, and misunderstanding things – it is reasonable to say you’re less supportive of the president after some bad economic times. [sent-205, score-0.667]
</p><p>14 So there’s a lot of evidence that people vote for what they think is good for the country. [sent-210, score-0.534]
</p><p>15 It would probably be hard to find many people who would argue that the American healthcare system is better than the French healthcare system, or even the Taiwanese healthcare system. [sent-227, score-0.5]
</p><p>16 The idea is that the richer places within a country – or even within a continent like Europe – tend to be more cosmopolitan, more socially liberal and lower-income places tend to be more traditional. [sent-243, score-0.459]
</p><p>17 I think a lot of white people feel Democrats are the black party and don’t support them for that reason. [sent-292, score-0.485]
</p><p>18 It was just assumed that white people weren’t going to vote for this guy. [sent-296, score-0.622]
</p><p>19 People did some surveys where they claimed that some percentage of white people were less likely to vote for Obama because he was black. [sent-306, score-0.56]
</p><p>20 Richard Nixon could get political success, basically, by convincing a lot of white people – not the white people who are traditionally in charge of the country but so-called ethnic white people – that the Democrats were not on their side. [sent-324, score-1.298]

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>3 0.34297058 <a title="2255-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-The_moral_of_the_story_is%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_look_yourself_up_on_Google.html">125 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-The moral of the story is, Don’t look yourself up on Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The fun part of this entry comes near the end.
 
Amanda Marcotte has some  nice things to say  about Red State, Blue State and connects our findings with some current political conflicts.  She picks up on our theme of perception and reality, that national journalists live in a different world and can have difficulty grasping national voting patterns:
  
 
The book definitively answers the perplexing question of our time, which is, “Why do poor people in red states vote against their economic interests?” The answer is, quite simply, they don’t.  There is no paradox.  To quote Gelman: “If poor people were a state, they would be ‘bluer’ even than Massachusetts; if rich people were a state, they would be as ‘red’ as Alabama, Kansas, the Dakotas, or Texas.”


Of course, I don’t think the stereotype of tea baggers have ever been that they’re poor.  But I do think there’s a supposition that they’re lower or middle middle class, and not well-educated.  That’s based on the illiterate signage, t</p><p>4 0.34271258 <a title="2255-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>5 0.33636212 <a title="2255-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.   But that is always the case.

<p>Introduction: Shankar Vedantam  writes :
  
Americans distrust the GOP. So why are they voting for it? . . . Gallup tells us that 71 percent of all Americans blame Republican policies for the bad economy, while only 48 percent blame the Obama administration. . . . while disapproval of congressional Democrats stands at 61 percent, disapproval of congressional Republicans stands at 67 percent.


[But] Republicans are heavily tipped to wrest control of one or both houses of Congress from the Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
  
Hey!  I know the answer to that one.  As I  wrote  in early September:
  
 
Those 10% or so of voters who plan to vote Republican–even while thinking that the Democrats will do a better job–are not necessarily being so unreasonable. The Democrats control the presidency and both houses of Congress, and so it’s a completely reasonable stance to prefer them to the Republicans yet still think they’ve gone too far and need a check on their power.

For one thing, more than half of them live in California, New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: Stephen Olivier points me to this horrible, horrible  news article  by Jonathan Haidt, “Why working-class people vote conservative”:
  
Across the world, blue-collar voters ally themselves with the political right . . . Why on Earth would a working-class person ever vote for a conservative candidate? This question has obsessed the American left since Ronald Reagan first captured the votes of so many union members, farmers, urban Catholics and other relatively powerless people – the so-called “Reagan Democrats”. . . .
  
Sorry, but no no no no no.  Where to start?
 
Here’s the difference between upper-income and lower-income votes in presidential elections:
 
   
 
Ronald Reagan did about 20 percentage points better among voters in the upper third of income, compared to voters in the lower third.  The relation between income and voting since 1980 is about the same as it was in the 1940s.
 
Oh yeah, Haidt said something about “across the world.”  How bout this:
 
   
 
It varies.  In mos</p><p>5 0.87877071 <a title="2255-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Same_old_story.html">1229 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Same old story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a review of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” William Saletan  writes :
  
You’re smart. You’re liberal. You’re well informed. You think conservatives are narrow-minded. You can’t understand why working-class Americans vote Republican. You figure they’re being duped. You’re wrong. . . .


Haidt diverges from other psychologists who have analyzed the left’s electoral failures. The usual argument of these psycho-­pundits is that conservative politicians manipulate voters’ neural roots — playing on our craving for authority, for example — to trick people into voting against their interests. But Haidt treats electoral success as a kind of evolutionary fitness test. He figures that if voters like Republican messages, there’s something in Republican messages worth liking. He chides psychologists who try to “explain away” conservatism, treating it as a pathology. Conservatism thrives because it fits how people think, and that’s what validates it.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>2 0.98479456 <a title="2255-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>3 0.9846406 <a title="2255-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-13-A_departmental_wiki_page%3F.html">571 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-13-A departmental wiki page?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?
 
In the meantime, if anybody feels like setting up a wikipedia entry for the research of Columbia’s statistics faculty, that</p><p>4 0.98419422 <a title="2255-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-23-My_last_post_on_albedo%2C_I_promise.html">625 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-23-My last post on albedo, I promise</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After seeing my recent  blogs  on Nathan Myhrvold, a friend told me that, in the tech world, the albedo-obsessed genius is known as a patent troll.
 
Really?
 
Yup.  My friend writes:
  
 
It’s perhaps indicative that Myhrvold comes up in the top-ten hits on Google for [patent troll]. These blog posts lay it out pretty clearly:

Here’s the story:  Katherine Chen  writes :
  
An executive summary version of Ackman and Dineen’s Powerpoint analysis underscores the potential impact of DSOs [direct selling organizations] upon distributors’ networks:

 
Recruiting family members, friends, work and church acquaintances and others in their communities into a rigged game, one that is highly likely to exact financial and emotional harm on those loved and trusted by them, has an impact that cannot be repaired or recompensed with dollars alone.
 

In class discussions over the years, students have made similar conclusions, with some sharing experiences about how they no longer can socialize with relatives and friends who are members of DSOs because of the relentless pressure to buy and join.  Others continue to do part-time work as DSO members who were recruited by family.</p><p>6 0.98356736 <a title="2255-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-03-He_doesn%E2%80%99t_trust_the_fit_._._._r%3D.999.html">315 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-03-He doesn’t trust the fit . . . r=.999</a></p>

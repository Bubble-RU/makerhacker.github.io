<p>Introduction: This is an echo of yesterday’s post,  Basketball Stats: Don’t model the probability of win, model the expected score differential .
 
As with basketball, so with baseball:  as the great Bill James wrote, if you want to predict a pitcher’s win-loss record, it’s better to use last year’s ERA than last year’s W-L.
 
As with basketball and baseball, so with epidemiology:  as Joseph Delaney  points out  in my favorite blog that nobody reads, you will see much better prediction if you first model change in the parameter (e.g. blood pressure) and then convert that to the binary disease state (e.g. hypertension) then if you just develop a logistic model for prob(hypertension).
 
As with basketball, baseball, and epidemiology, so with political science:  instead of modeling election winners, better to model vote differential, a point that I made back in 1993 (see page 120  here ) but which seems to continually need  repeating .  A forecasting method should get essentially no credit for correctl</p><p>3 0.2121838 <a title="2222-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-25-Basketball_Stats%3A__Don%E2%80%99t_model_the_probability_of_win%2C_model_the_expected_score_differential..html">2224 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-25-Basketball Stats:  Don’t model the probability of win, model the expected score differential.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone who wants to remain anonymous writes:
  
I am working to create a more accurate in-game win probability model for basketball games. My idea is for each timestep in a game (a second, 5 seconds, etc), use the Vegas line, the current score differential, who has the ball, and the number of possessions played already (to account for differences in pace) to create a point estimate probability of the home team winning.


This problem would seem to fit a multi-level model structure well. It seems silly to estimate 2,000 regressions (one for each timestep), but the coefficients should vary at each timestep. Do you have suggestions for what type of model this could/would be? Additionally, I believe this needs to be some form of logit/probit given the binary dependent variable (win or loss).


Finally, do you have suggestions for what package could accomplish this in Stata or R?
  
To answer the questions in reverse order: 
3.  I’d hope this could be done in Stan (which can be run from R)</p><p>4 0.20511475 <a title="2222-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-09-On_deck_this_week.html">2366 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-09-On deck this week</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Remember that bizarre episode in Freakonomics 2, where Levitt and Dubner went to the Batcave-like lair of a genius billionaire who told them that “the problem with solar panels is that they’re  black .”  I’m  not the only one  who wondered at the time:  of all the issues to bring up about solar power, why that one?
 
Well, I think I’ve found the answer in  this article  by John Lanchester:
  
In 2004, Nathan Myhrvold, who had, five years earlier, at the advanced age of forty, retired from his job as Microsoft’s chief technology officer, began to contribute to the culinary discussion board egullet.org . . . At the time he grew interested in sous vide, there was no book in English on the subject, and he resolved to write one. . . . broadened it further to include information about the basic physics of heating processes, then to include the physics and chemistry of traditional cooking techniques, and then to include the science and practical application of the highly inventive new techniq</p><p>3 0.88756603 <a title="2222-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-12-The_power_of_the_puzzlegraph.html">1669 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-12-The power of the puzzlegraph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  reports  that the following project from Krisztina Szucs and Mate Cziner has won their visualization challenge, “launched in September 2012 to solicit visualisations based on the OECD’s data-rich Education at a Glance report”:

From the press release:
  
Entries from around the world focused on data related to the economic costs and return on investment in education . . . [The winning entry] takes a detailed look at public vs. private and men vs. women for selected countries . . .


The judges were particularly impressed by the angled slope format of the visualisation, which encourages comparison between the upper-secondary and tertiary benefits of education. Szucs and Cziner were also lauded for  their striking visual design, which draws users into exploring their piece  [emphasis added].

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Around the time I was finishing up my Ph.D. thesis, I was trying to come up with a good title–something more grabby than “Topics in Image Reconstruction for Emission Tomography”–and one of the other students said:  How about something iike, Female Mass Murderers:  Babes Behind Bars?  That sounded good to me, and I was all set to use it.  I had a plan:  I’d first submit the one the boring title–that’s how it would be recorded in all the official paperwork–but then at the last minute I’d substitute in the new title page before submitting to the library.  (This was in the days of hard copies.)  Nobody would look at the time, then later on, if anyone went into the library to find my thesis, they’d have a pleasant surprise.  Anyway, as I said, I was all set to do this, but a friend warned me off.  He said that at some point, someone might find it, and the rumor would spread that I’m a sexist pig.  So I didn’t.

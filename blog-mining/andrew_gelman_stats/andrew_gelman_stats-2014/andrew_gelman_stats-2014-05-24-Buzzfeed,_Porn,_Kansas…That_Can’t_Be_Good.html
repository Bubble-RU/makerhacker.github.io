Thought you might find this funny:


Buzzfeed set out to study porn consumption versus the red/blue political spectrum. And they failed miserably. An article form  opennews.org  outlines six major fallacies Buzzfeed committed, the best of which resulted in the Kansas effect:


“Pornhub’s writeup omitted any explicit description of their methodology—this is never a good sign—but it seems to have involved mapping the IP addresses from which users visited the site to physical addresses and reverse geocoding those to get states…. a large percentage of IP addresses could not be resolved to an address any more specific than “USA.” When that address was geocoded, it returned a point in the centroid of the continental United States, which placed it in the state of—you guessed it—Kansas!”


As a result, Kansas was 2.95 std dev above the mean. Those pervs!

<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes:
  
We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: One of my left-wing colleagues pointed me to  this  Fox TV interview in which UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose expresses displeasure with having his research criticized by liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America.
 
My colleague thought it was irresponsible and unprofessional for Groseclose to get all indignant about the criticism.  But I understood.  I remember how after the state Attorney General’s office released the study Jeff Fagan and I did on police stops ( see here  for the research-paper version), we were viciously attacked.  Some creep from the NYC Law Department sent a nasty letter full of accusations that were . . . I’d say “bullshit” but I don’t want to say that because “bullshit” contains the word “shit” and I don’t want to use profanity on this blog . . . anyway, this lawyer creep sent us an aggressive letter with bogus claims about our research competence.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: This post is by  David K. Park  and courtesy of Alex Palen Ellis…
  
Thought you might find this funny:


Buzzfeed set out to study porn consumption versus the red/blue political spectrum. And they failed miserably. An article form  opennews.org  outlines six major fallacies Buzzfeed committed, the best of which resulted in the Kansas effect:


“Pornhub’s writeup omitted any explicit description of their methodology—this is never a good sign—but it seems to have involved mapping the IP addresses from which users visited the site to physical addresses and reverse geocoding those to get states…. a large percentage of IP addresses could not be resolved to an address any more specific than “USA.” When that address was geocoded, it returned a point in the centroid of the continental United States, which placed it in the state of—you guessed it—Kansas!”


As a result, Kansas was 2.95 std dev above the mean. Those pervs!

<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>3 0.75043929 <a title="2346-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-20-Last_post_on_Hipmunk.html">917 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-20-Last post on Hipmunk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:
  
Check out the figure below from The Grammar of Graphics. Dan Rope invented this graphic and programmed it in Java in the late 1990′s. We shopped this graph around to Orbitz and Expedia but they weren’t interested.

<p>Introduction: Nick Polson and James Scott  write :
  
We generalize the half-Cauchy prior for a global scale parameter to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Finally, we prove a result that characterizes the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators under all priors in the class. These arguments provide an alternative, classical justification for the use of the half-Cauchy prior in Bayesian hierarchical models, complementing the arguments in Gelman (2006).
  
This makes me happy, of course.  It’s great to be validated.
 
The only think I didn’t catch is how they set the scale parameter for the half-Cauchy prior.  In my 2006 paper I frame it as a weakly informative prior and recommend that the scale be set based on actual prior knowledge.  But Polson and Scott are talking about a default choice.  I used to think that such a</p><p>5 0.71990681 <a title="2346-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-27-Heat_map.html">593 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-27-Heat map</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jarad Niemi sends along this plot:
 
 
 
and writes:
  
2010-2011 Miami Heat offensive (red), defensive (blue), and combined (black) player contribution means (dots) and 95% credible intervals (lines) where zero indicates an average NBA player. Larger positive numbers for offensive and combined are better while larger negative numbers for defense are better.


In retrospect, I [Niemi] should have plotted -1*defensive_contribution so that larger was always better. The main point with this figure is that this awesome combination of James-Wade-Bosh that was discussed immediately after the LeBron trade to the Heat has a one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other aspect. At least according to my analysis, Bosh is hurting his team compared to the average player (although not statistically significant) due to his terrible defensive contribution (which is statistically significant).
  
All fine so far.  But the punchline comes at the end, when he writes:

</p><p>7 But, in October 2008, Mankiw  calculated  that Obama’s would tax his marginal dollar at 93%. [sent-11, score-0.668]
</p><p>8 What we’re saying, then, is that Mankiw’s marginal tax rate is currently thirteen percentage points lower than he’d anticipated two years ago. [sent-12, score-1.044]
</p><p>9 In fact, Mankiw’s stated current marginal tax rate of 80% is three points lower than the tax rate he expected to pay under a McCain administration! [sent-13, score-1.519]
</p><p>10 And if the proposed new tax laws are introduced, Mankiw’s marginal tax rate of 90% is  still  three percentage points lower than he’d anticipated, back during the 2008 election campaign. [sent-14, score-1.341]
</p><p>11 If the new tax plans are put into effect, Mankiw will still keep 43% more of his money than he was expecting to keep, only two years ago. [sent-17, score-0.655]
</p><p>12 I think he’s writing the articles because he has views that he thinks are important and he wants to share them with the world. [sent-33, score-0.292]

</p><p>15 And here’s  what I wrote at the time :    To start with, it does sound like Mankiw’s kids are already well provided for, and, although I’m sure they’d disagree with me on this, it’s not clear that they would benefit from having more money in the bank when their parents are gone. [sent-45, score-0.36]
</p><p>16 But, for that, the marginal tax rate is nothing close to 90% or even 80%. [sent-52, score-0.796]

</p><p>18 Back to taxes    In writing the above, I’m not trying to suggest that the tax rate be X% or Y% or Z%. [sent-56, score-0.757]
</p><p>19 He can accept that he plays with his kids for non-monetary reasons; why is it so difficult to accept that he writes newspaper columns for nonmonetary reasons also? [sent-72, score-0.359]
</p><p>20 I’m not saying he should not write more columns; I just think it’s a bit silly to analyze that decision based on his dollar compensation for them, given that this has got to be the most minor reason for writing them. [sent-73, score-0.315]

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to a  blog  by Greg Mankiw with further details on his argument that his anticipated 90% marginal tax rate will reduce his work level.
 
Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.
 
2.  Neither Cowen nor Mankiw address</p><p>4 0.56989932 <a title="2261-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw_tax_update.html">366 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw tax update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.  At the time, I conjectured this was a general difference in attitude between political scientists and economists, but in retrospect I realize I’m dealing with n=1 in each case.
 
 See here  for further discussion of taxing “justly acquired endowments.”
 
The only reason I’m bringing this all up now is that I think it is relevant to our recent discussion  here  and  here  of Mankiw’s work incentives.  Mankiw objected to paying a higher marginal tax rate, and I think part of this is that he sees taxes as a form of punishment, and since he came by his income honestly he doesn’t think it’s fair to have to pay taxes on it.   My perspective i</p><p>5 0.41044229 <a title="2261-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.19763328 <a title="2261-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-Economists_don%E2%80%99t_think_like_accountants%E2%80%94but_maybe_they_should.html">922 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-Economists don’t think like accountants—but maybe they should</a></p>

So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.

<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.  At the time, I conjectured this was a general difference in attitude between political scientists and economists, but in retrospect I realize I’m dealing with n=1 in each case.
 
 See here  for further discussion of taxing “justly acquired endowments.”
 
The only reason I’m bringing this all up now is that I think it is relevant to our recent discussion  here  and  here  of Mankiw’s work incentives.  Mankiw objected to paying a higher marginal tax rate, and I think part of this is that he sees taxes as a form of punishment, and since he came by his income honestly he doesn’t think it’s fair to have to pay taxes on it.   My perspective i</p><p>5 0.86539173 <a title="2261-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.78012007 <a title="2261-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-30-A_tax_on_inequality%2C_or_a_tax_to_keep_inequality_at_the_current_level%3F.html">1145 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-30-A tax on inequality, or a tax to keep inequality at the current level?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Greg Mankiw  writes  (link from  Tyler Cowen ):
  
Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000.

<p>Introduction: Wegman:  “It’s not reprinted 100 percent like you had it.”
 
Wikipedia guy:  “No, you added another paragraph at the end and you changed the headline. . . . You even copied the typos that I’ve corrected on my website.  It was taken verbatim and reprinted in your paper.”
 
The original author got a  check  for $500 but, unfortunately, no free subscription to “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics” (a $1400-$2800  value ).
 
P.S.  To those who think I’m being mean to Wegman:  I haven’t yet heard that he’s apologized to the people whose work he copied without attribution, or to the people who spent their time tracking all this down, or to the U.S. Congress for misrepresenting his expertise in his official report.
 
Everyone makes mistakes, and just about everyone has ethical lapses at times.  But when you get caught you’re supposed to make apology and restitution.</p><p>6 0.8656044 <a title="2261-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-12-Update_on_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_work_incentives.html">338 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-12-Update on Mankiw’s work incentives</a></p>

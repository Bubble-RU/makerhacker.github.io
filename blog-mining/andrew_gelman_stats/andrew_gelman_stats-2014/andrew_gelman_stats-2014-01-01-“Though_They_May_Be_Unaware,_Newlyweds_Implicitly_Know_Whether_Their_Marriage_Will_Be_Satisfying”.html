<p>Introduction: David Duvenaud writes:
  
I’ve been following  your recent discussions  about how an AI could do statistics [see also  here ].  I was especially excited about your suggestion for new statistical methods using “a language-like approach to recursively creating new models from a specified list of distributions and transformations, and an automatic approach to checking model fit.”


Your discussion of these ideas was exciting to me and my colleagues because we recently  did some work  taking a step in this direction, automatically searching through a grammar over Gaussian process regression models.


Roger Grosse previously  did the same thing , but over matrix decomposition models using held-out predictive likelihood to check model fit.


These are both examples of automatic Bayesian model-building by a search over more and more complex models, as you suggested.  One nice thing is that both grammars include lots of standard models for free, and they seem to work pretty well, although the</p><p>4 0.12857002 <a title="2156-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-24-Bleg%3A_Automatic_Differentiation_for_Log_Prob_Gradients%3F.html">535 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-24-Bleg: Automatic Differentiation for Log Prob Gradients?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need help picking out an automatic differentiation package for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior of a  generalized linear model with deep interactions.  Specifically, we need to compute gradients for log probability functions with thousands of parameters that involve matrix (determinants, eigenvalues, inverses), stats (distributions), and math (log gamma) functions.  Any suggestions?
    
 The Application: Hybrid Monte Carlo for Posteriors 
 
We’re getting serious about implementing posterior sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC speeds up mixing by including gradient information to help guide the Metropolis proposals toward areas  high probability.  In practice, the algorithm requires a handful or  of gradient calculations per sample, but there are many dimensions and the functions are hairy enough we don’t want to compute derivaties by hand.

<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups.

<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).

This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

<p>Introduction: I had a couple of email exchanges with Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and James Fowler, two of the authors of the article on the gene that is associated with life satisfaction which we  blogged  the other day.  (Bruno Frey, the third author of the article in question, is out of town according to his email.)  Fowler also commented  directly  on the blog.
 
I won’t go through all the details, but now I have a better sense of what’s going on.  (Thanks, Jan and James!)  Here’s my current understanding:
 
 1.   The original manuscript was divided into two parts:   an article  by De Neve alone published in the Journal of Human Genetics, and  an article  by De Neve, Fowler, Frey, and Nicholas Christakis submitted to Econometrica.  The latter paper repeats the analysis from the Adolescent Health survey and also replicates with data from the Framingham heart study (hence Christakis’s involvement).

I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”
 
Hutson  writes : 
  
  
Psychological Science recently published a fascinating new study on jealousy. I was interested to read Newsweek’s 1300-word article covering the research by their science editor, Sharon Begley.

 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years. We found no correlation between spouses’ automatic and conscious attitu</p><p>2 0.93953353 <a title="2156-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-04-Burgess_on_Kipling.html">16 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-04-Burgess on Kipling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my last entry derived from  Anthony Burgess’s book reviews , and it’ll be short.  His review of Angus Wilson’s “The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling:  His Life and Works” is a wonderfully balanced little thing.  Nothing incredibly deep–like most items in the collection, the review is only two pages long–but I give it credit for being a rare piece of Kipling criticism I’ve seen that (a) seriously engages with the politics, without (b) congratulating itself on bravely going against the fashions of the politically incorrect chattering classes by celebrating Kipling’s magnificent achievement blah blah blah.  Instead, Burgess shows respect for Kipling’s work and puts it in historical, biographical, and literary context.
 
Burgess concludes that Wilson’s book “reminds us, in John Gross’s words, that Kipling ‘remains a haunting, unsettling presence, with whom we still have to come to terms.’  Still.”  Well put, and generous of Burgess to end his review with another’s quote.

<p>Introduction: Jessy, Aki, and I  write :
  
We review the Akaike, deviance, and Watanabe-Akaike information criteria from a Bayesian perspective, where the goal is to estimate expected out-of-sample-prediction error using a bias-corrected adjustment of within-sample error. We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this review is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.
  
I like this paper.  It came about as a result of preparing Chapter 7 for the  new BDA .  I had difficulty understanding AIC, DIC, WAIC, etc., but I recognized that these methods served a need.  My first plan was to just apply DIC and WAIC on a couple of simple examples (a linear regression and the 8 schools) and leave it at that.

<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

<p>Introduction: Commenter Rahul  asked  what I thought of this  note  by Scott Firestone ( link  from Tyler Cowen) criticizing a recent  discussion  by Kevin Drum suggesting that lead exposure causes violent crime.  Firestone writes: 
  
  
It turns out there was in fact a prospective study done—but its implications for Drum’s argument are mixed. The study was a cohort study done by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. Between 1979 and 1984, 376 infants were recruited. Their parents consented to have lead levels in their blood tested over time; this was matched with records over subsequent decades of the individuals’ arrest records, and specifically arrest for violent crime. Ultimately, some of these individuals were dropped from the study; by the end, 250 were selected for the results.


The researchers found that for each increase of 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, there was a higher risk for being arrested for a violent crime, but a further look at the numbers shows a more mixe</p><p>6 0.91166484 <a title="2156-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Duncan_Watts_and_the_Titanic.html">1370 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Duncan Watts and the Titanic</a></p>

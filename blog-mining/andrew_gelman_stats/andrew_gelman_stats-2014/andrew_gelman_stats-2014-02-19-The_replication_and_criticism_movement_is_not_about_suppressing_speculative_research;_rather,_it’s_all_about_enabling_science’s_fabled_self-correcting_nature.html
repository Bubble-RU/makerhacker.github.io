[sent-5, score-0.247]
</p><p>2 But I wonder what the effect would be on reducing the opportunity for scientific mistakes that turn into big ideas. [sent-19, score-0.5]
</p><p>3 Nobody is suggesting “not allowing” for the publication of scientific mistakes. [sent-23, score-0.257]
</p><p>4 The point is to suggest there should be fewer barriers to the publication of criticism of this sort of high-profile publication. [sent-25, score-0.492]
</p><p>5 Meanwhile, criticism of this work ends up appears in blogs etc. [sent-27, score-0.337]
</p><p>6 The most notorious example was that Bem paper where the journal that published his ridiculous paper refused to publish the failed replications. [sent-28, score-0.371]
</p><p>7 So, yes, let’s give people the chance to publish and fail, even to embarrass themselves! [sent-29, score-0.237]
</p><p>8 In the grand scheme of things, a scientist who publishes 9 failures and one major success may well be making more of a positive contribution than an otherwise equally placed scientist who publishes 10 boring minor incremental contributions, even if they happen to be correct. [sent-30, score-0.466]
</p><p>9 But let’s move that process forward and make it easier for people to point out the mistakes in those 9 failures sooner. [sent-31, score-0.362]
</p><p>10 Science can be self-correcting, but that “self-correcting” process is the result of actions of many individuals in the system, and right now I do agree with Holcomb the barriers to the publications of replications and criticism are too high. [sent-32, score-0.616]
</p><p>11 As noted above, I don’t oppose the publication (in journals or in blogs) of speculation, as long as the source of the relevant data (in this case, all my anecdotes) is made clear. [sent-37, score-0.327]
</p><p>12 But let me get back to the key point:  as Holcomb says, the self-correction that is central to the scientific process can be slowed down or it can be helped along. [sent-41, score-0.278]
</p><p>13 Working to improve the self-correction process is  not  equivalent to “reducing the opportunity for scientific mistakes that turn into big ideas. [sent-42, score-0.591]
</p><p>14 One issue that came up in the discussion is that a published criticism could well be a lesser piece of work, compared to original research. [sent-46, score-0.436]
</p><p>15 Indeed, if I think a paper is flawed and I go to the trouble of criticizing it, I probably  won’t  want to put an equivalent effort into the criticism as the original researcher put into the published paper. [sent-47, score-0.588]
</p><p>16 Still, I think the criticism should be published, and I think it’s a big mistake when journals reject criticisms because they’re not major research contributions. [sent-50, score-0.703]
</p><p>17 One problem, I think, is that publication in journals is not just about the science, it’s a scarce measure of value that’s used in hiring, promotion, grant review, etc. [sent-51, score-0.385]
</p><p>18 With that issue in mind,  I’d have no problem if journals were to flag corrections and replications, so that tenure committees etc would recognize that these are not original research. [sent-55, score-0.568]
</p><p>19 This way, people don’t have to worry that the credit for their original research is being diluted by endless trivial criticisms and replications. [sent-58, score-0.531]
</p><p>20 But science as a whole would benefit, because these criticisms and replications would be right out there in the literature for anyone to read. [sent-59, score-0.488]

<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.

<p>Introduction: Social science research has been getting pretty bad press recently, what with the Excel buccaneers who didn’t know how to handle data with different numbers of observations per country, and the psychologist who published dozens of papers based on fabricated data, and the Evilicious guy who wouldn’t let people review his data tapes, etc etc.  And that’s not even considering Dr. Anil Potti.
 
On the other hand, the revelation of all these problems can be taken as evidence that things are getting better.  Psychology researcher Gary Marcus  writes :
  
There is something positive that has come out of the crisis of replicability—something vitally important for all experimental sciences. For years, it was extremely difficult to publish a direct replication, or a failure to replicate an experiment, in a good journal. . . . Now, happily, the scientific culture has changed. . . . The Reproducibility Project, from the Center for Open Science is now underway . . .

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>5 0.22932467 <a title="2217-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-06-How_much_time_%28if_any%29_should_we_spend_criticizing_research_that%E2%80%99s_fraudulent%2C_crappy%2C_or_just_plain_pointless%3F.html">2235 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-06-How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a brief email exchange with Jeff Leek regarding our recent  discussions  of replication, criticism, and the self-correcting process of science.
 
Jeff writes:
  
(1) I can see the problem with serious, evidence-based criticisms not being published in the same journal (and linked to) studies that are shown to be incorrect. I have been mostly seeing these sorts of things show up in blogs. But I’m not sure that is a bad thing. I think people read blogs more than they read the literature. I wonder if this means that blogs will eventually be a sort of “shadow literature”? 


(2) I think there is a ton of bad literature out there, just like there is a ton of bad stuff on Google. If we focus too much on the bad stuff we will be paralyzed. I still manage to find good papers despite all the bad papers. 


(3) I think one positive solution to this problem is to incentivize/publish referee reports and give people credit for a good referee report just like they get credit for a good paper.

<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>3 0.91456163 <a title="2217-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-I_posted_this_as_a_comment_on_a_sociology_blog.html">2353 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-I posted this as a comment on a sociology blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  blog post  by Phil Davis on “the emergence of a citation cartel.”  Davis tells the story: 
  
  
Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived. Of the remaining 45 citations, 44 cited the Me</p><p>5 0.90297359 <a title="2217-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-31-How_to_fix_the_tabloids%3F__Toward_replicable_social_science_research.html">1878 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-31-How to fix the tabloids?

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>6 0.90244842 <a title="2217-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-16-%E2%80%9CGroundbreaking_or_Definitive%3F_Journals_Need_to_Pick_One%E2%80%9D.html">1122 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-16-“Groundbreaking or Definitive?

<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  points to  a post by Alex Holcombe, who disputes the idea that science is self-correcting.  Holcombe  writes  [scroll down to get to his part]:
  
The pace of scientific production has quickened, and self-correction has suffered. Findings that might correct old results are considered less interesting than results from more original research questions. Potential corrections are also more contested. As the competition for space in prestigious journals has become increasingly frenzied, doing and publishing studies that would confirm the rapidly accumulating new discoveries, or would correct them, became a losing proposition.
  
Holcombe picks up on some points that we’ve discussed a lot here in the past year.  Here’s Holcombe:
  
In certain subfields, almost all new work appears in only a very few journals, all associated with a single professional society. There is then no way around the senior gatekeepers, who may then suppress corrections with impunity. . . .

<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.

<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>4 0.95212567 <a title="2217-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.95031101 <a title="2217-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-29-%E2%80%9CQuestioning_The_Lancet%2C_PLOS%2C_And_Other_Surveys_On_Iraqi_Deaths%2C_An_Interview_With_Univ._of_London_Professor_Michael_Spagat%E2%80%9D.html">2191 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-29-“Questioning The Lancet, PLOS, And Other Surveys On Iraqi Deaths, An Interview With Univ. of London Professor Michael Spagat”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat points to  this interview , which, he writes, covers themes that are discussed on the blog such as wrong ideas that don’t die, peer review and the statistics of conflict deaths.
 
I agree.  It’s good stuff.  Here are some of the things that Spagat says (he’s being interviewed by Joel Wing):
  
In fact, the standard excess-deaths concept leads to an interesting conundrum when combined with an interesting fact exposed in the next-to-latest  Human Security Report ; in most countries child mortality rates decline during armed conflict (chapter 6). So if you believe the usual excess-death causality story then you’re forced to conclude that many conflicts actually save the lives of many children. Of course, the idea of wars savings lives is pretty hard to swallow. A much more sensible understanding is that there are a variety of factors that determine child deaths and that in many cases the factors that save the lives of children are stronger than the negative effects that confli</p><p>6 0.94974715 <a title="2217-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>

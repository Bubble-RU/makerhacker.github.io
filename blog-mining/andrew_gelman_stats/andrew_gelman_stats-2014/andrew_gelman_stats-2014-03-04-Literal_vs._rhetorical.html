</p><p>9 It’s hard to get a paper published in a top journal—and, from an editor’s point of view, it’s hard to get media publicity—so, in either case, when you’ve achieved that goal, it’s natural to want to take a rest. [sent-36, score-0.457]

<p>Introduction: I post (approximately) once a day and don’t plan to change that.
 
I have enough material to post more often—for example, I could intersperse existing blog posts with summaries of my published papers or of other work that I like; and, beyond this, we currently have a one-to-two-month backlog of posts—but I’m afraid that if the number of posts were doubled, the attention given to each would be roughly halved.
 
Looking at it the other way, I certainly don’t want to  reduce  my level of posting.  Sure, it takes time to blog, but these are things that are important for me to say.  If I were to blog less frequently, it would only be because I was pouring all these words into a different vessel, for example a book.  For now, though, I think it makes sense to blog and then collect the words later as appropriate.  With blogging I get comments, and many of these comments are helpful—either directly (by pointing out errors in my thinking or linking to relevant software or literature) or indirec</p><p>3 0.22245838 <a title="2233-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-11-What_if_I_were_to_stop_publishing_in_journals%3F.html">2244 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-11-What if I were to stop publishing in journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In our recent discussion of modes of publication, Joseph Wilson wrote, “The single best reform science can make right now is to decouple publication from career advancement, thereby reducing the number of publications by an order of magnitude and then move to an entirely disjointed, informal, online free-for-all communication system for research results.”
 
My first thought on this was: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. But then I got to thinking: what would it  really  mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me—I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future—but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).
 
However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should’ve just typed it all in then.  In the old days I just wouldn’t run this</p><p>4 0.21275835 <a title="2233-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.18909101 <a title="2233-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  blog post  by Phil Davis on “the emergence of a citation cartel.”  Davis tells the story: 
  
  
Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived. Of the remaining 45 citations, 44 cited the Me</p><p>3 0.91287255 <a title="2233-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-I_posted_this_as_a_comment_on_a_sociology_blog.html">2353 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-I posted this as a comment on a sociology blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>4 0.91218144 <a title="2233-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>5 0.90641177 <a title="2233-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-11-What_if_I_were_to_stop_publishing_in_journals%3F.html">2244 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-11-What if I were to stop publishing in journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In our recent discussion of modes of publication, Joseph Wilson wrote, “The single best reform science can make right now is to decouple publication from career advancement, thereby reducing the number of publications by an order of magnitude and then move to an entirely disjointed, informal, online free-for-all communication system for research results.”
 
My first thought on this was: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. But then I got to thinking: what would it  really  mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me—I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future—but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).
 
However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should’ve just typed it all in then.

<p>Introduction: Someone points me to  this report  from Tilburg University on disgraced psychology researcher Diederik Stapel.  The reports includes bits like this:
  
When the fraud was first discovered, limiting the harm it caused for the victims was a matter of urgency. This was particularly the case for Mr Stapel’s former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers . . . However, the Committees were of the opinion that the main bulk of the work had not yet even started. . . . Journal publications can often leave traces that reach far into and even beyond scientific disciplines. The self-cleansing character of science calls for fraudulent publications to be withdrawn and no longer to proliferate within the literature. In addition, based on their initial impressions, the Committees believed that there were other serious issues within Mr Stapel’s publications . . . This brought into the spotlight a research culture in which this sloppy science, alongside out-and-out fraud, was able to remain undetected</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96228468 <a title="2233-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-04-Literal_vs._rhetorical.html">2233 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-04-Literal vs. rhetorical</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>4 0.948883 <a title="2233-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-15-How_do_I_make_my_graphs%3F.html">1764 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-15-How do I make my graphs?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone who wishes to remain anonymous writes: 
  
  
I’ve been following your blog a long time and enjoy your posts on visualization/statistical graphics matters.  I don’t recall however you ever describing the details of your setup for plotting.  I’m a new R user (convert from matplotlib) and would love to know your thoughts on the ideal setup: do you use mainly the R base?  Do you use lattice?  What do you think of ggplot2?  etc.  


I found ggplot2 nearly indecipherable until a recent eureka moment, and I think its default theme is a waste tremendous ink (all those silly grey backgrounds and grids are really unnecessary), but if you customize that away it can be made to look like ordinary, pretty statistical graphs.  


Feel free to respond on your blog, but if you do, please remove my name from the post (my colleagues already make fun of me for thinking about visualization too much.) 
  
I love that last bit!
 
Anyway, my response is that I do everything in base graphics (using my</p><p>5 0.94256467 <a title="2233-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-16-30_days_of_statistics.html">771 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-16-30 days of statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was talking with a colleague about one of our research projects and said that I would write something up, if blogging didn’t get in the way.  She suggested that for the next month I just blog about my research ideas.
 
So I think I’ll do that.  This means no mocking of plagiarists, no reflections on literature, no answers to miscellaneous questions about how many groups you need in a multilevel model, no rants about economists, no links to pretty graphs, etc., for 30 days.
 
Meanwhile, I have a roughly 30-day backlog.  So after my next 30 days of stat blogging, the backlog will gradually appear.  There’s some good stuff there, including reflections on Milos, a (sincere) tribute to the haters, an updated Twitteo Killed the Bloggio Star, a question about acupuncture, and some remote statistical modeling advice I gave that actually worked!  I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.
 
But you’ll have to wait for all that fun stuff.  For the next thirty days, it’s statistics research every day.

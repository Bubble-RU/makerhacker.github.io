I have  two postdoc openings for basic research in probabilistic modeling .


The thrusts are (a) scalable inference and (b) model checking.  We 
will be developing new methods and implementing them in probabilistic 
programming systems.  I am open to applicants interested in many kinds 
of applications and from any field.
  
“Scalable inference” means black-box VB and related ideas, and “probabilistic programming systems” means Stan!  (You might be familiar with Stan as an implementation of Nuts for posterior sampling, but Stan is also an efficient program for computing probability densities and their gradients, and as such is an ideal platform for developing scalable implementations of variational inference and related algorithms.)
 
And you know I like model checking.

<p>Introduction: We’re working with polling company YouGov to track public opinion, state-by-state and district-by-district, during the 2014 campaign.  We’ll be using multilevel regression and poststratification, and implementing it in Stan, and developing the necessary new parts of Stan to get this running scalably and efficiently.  And we’ll be making the most detailed, up-to-date election forecasts.
 
What you’ll be doing if you join us as a postdoc: 
- You’ll be in the midst of the most advanced polling team anywhere; 
- You’ll be doing cutting-edge statistical research on MRP with deep interactions; 
- You’ll be doing basic research in statistical computing, developing fast and scalable deterministic and stochastic algorithms for fitting multilevel models; 
- You’ll be working inside Stan, the most advanced general computational framework for Bayesian analysis. 
 We’re doing research, not just implementing existing methods. 
 
What we need:

<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.
 
 Fernando:   Incentives? Impact factors? Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . .

I’ve only looked at the website, not the book itself, and I’m sure I’d find lots of places to disagree with it on details, but the general flow seemed reasonable, also I liked that there’s lots of course materials to go with it.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago Larry Bartels  presented  this graph, a version of which latter appeared in his book Unequal Democracy:
 
 
 
Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy. This is consistent with Democrats’ general policies of lowering unemployment, as compared to Republicans lowering inflation, and, by comparing first-term to second-term presidents, he found that the result couldn’t simply be explained as a rebound or alternation pattern.
 
The question then arose, why have the Republicans won so many elections? Why aren’t the Democrats consistently dominating? Non-economic issues are part of the story, of course, but lots of evidence shows the economy to be a key concern for voters, so it’s still hard to see how, with a pattern such as shown above, the Republicans could keep winning.
 
Larry had some explanations, largely having to do with timing:  under De</p><p>6 0.93978488 <a title="2173-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-01-Two_Postdoc_Positions_Available_on_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Modeling.html">62 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-01-Two Postdoc Positions Available on Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling</a></p>

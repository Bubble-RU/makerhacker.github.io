<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.

<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states. In light of this correlation, would you say that there currently is</p><p>5 0.10208385 <a title="2309-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Data_mining_efforts_for_Obama%E2%80%99s_campaign.html">951 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Data mining efforts for Obama’s campaign</a></p>

Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

I’m a neuroscientist at Caltech . . . I’m using the debate on the  ESP paper , as I’m sure other labs around the world are, as an opportunity to discuss some basic statistical issues/ideas w/ my lab.


Request: Is there any chance you would be willing to share your thoughts about the difference between exploratory “data mining” studies and confirmatory studies? What I have in mind is that one could use a dataset to explore/discover novel hypotheses  and then conduct another experiment to test those hypotheses rigorously. It seems that a good combination of both approaches could be the best of both worlds, since the first would lead to novel hypothesis discovery, and the later to careful testing. . . it is a fundamental issue for neuroscience and psychology.

Howdy Andrew,


Hope you’re keeping well! I was wondering if you’re open to guest posts at Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science – if you are interested, I can offer an original 500-1000 word, very high quality article in fitting with the site. All research and writing will be carried out by a professional writer (namely, me) and once approved it will be entirely yours to place on the site as you see fit.


I can choose a title for the article or you can suggest one and I’ll work around that. Normally I write for property and travel sites (particularly cruise and ski related), but I’m game for anything if you’re happy to entertain me. I can also include some copyright-free and high quality pictures related to the blog post.


You’re probably wondering what’s in it for me, which is a fair question – in return, all I’d ask is a subtle link back in return. Other than that, the material itself would be non-commericial</p><p>6 0.6890651 <a title="2309-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-24-An_open_site_for_researchers_to_post_and_share_papers.html">2304 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-24-An open site for researchers to post and share papers</a></p>

Brian Nosek, Eric Luis Uhlmann, Dan Martin, and I just launched a project through the Open Science Center we think you’ll find interesting.


The basic idea is to “Crowdstorm a Dataset”. Multiple independent analysts are recruited to test the same hypothesis on the same data set in whatever manner they see as best. If everyone comes up with the same results, then scientists can speak with one voice. If not, the subjectivity and conditionality of results on analysis strategy is made transparent. For this first project, we are crowdstorming the question of whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players.


The full project description is  here .


If you’re interested in being one of the crowdstormer analysts, you can register  here .


All analysts will receive an author credit on the final paper. We would love to have Bayesian analysts represented in the group.

In general, is there any way to do MCMC with a fixed constraint?


E.g., suppose I measure the three internal angles of a triangle with errors ~dnorm(0, tau) where tau might be different for the three measurements.  This would be an easy BUGS/WinBUGS/JAGS exercise but suppose, in addition, I wanted to include prior information to the effect that the three angles had to total 180 degrees exactly.


Is this feasible? Could you point me to any BUGS model in which a constraint of this type is implemented?


Note: Even in my own (non-hierarchical) code which tends to be component-wise, random-walk Metropolis with tuned Laplacian proposals, I cannot see how I could incorporate such a constraint.
  
My reply:  See page 508 of Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd edition).  We have an example of such a model there (from  this paper  with Bois and Jiang).</p><p>3 0.9344002 <a title="2309-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-30-Why_don%E2%80%99t_we_have_peer_reviewing_for_oral_presentations%3F.html">172 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-30-Why don’t we have peer reviewing for oral presentations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Panos Ipeirotis  writes in his blog  post :
  

Everyone who has attended a conference knows that the quality of the talks is very uneven. There are talks that are highly engaging, entertaining, and describe nicely the research challenges and solutions. And there are talks that are a waste of time. Either the presenter cannot present clearly, or the presented content is impossible to digest within the time frame of the presentation.


We already have reviewing for the written part. The program committee examines the quality of the written  paper and vouch for its technical content. However, by looking at a paper it is impossible to know how nicely it can be presented. Perhaps the seemingly solid but boring paper can be a very entertaining presentation. Or an excellent paper may be written by a horrible presenter.


Why not having a second round of reviewing, where the authors of accepted papers submit their presentations (slides and a YouTube video) for presentation to the conference.</p><p>4 0.93387401 <a title="2309-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-24-Difficulties_in_publishing_non-replications_of_implausible_findings.html">1137 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-24-Difficulties in publishing non-replications of implausible findings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone points me to  this  news article by Christopher Shea on the challenges of debunking ESP.  Shea  writes :
  
Earlier this year, a major psychology journal published a paper suggesting that there was some evidence for “pre-cognition,” a form of ESP. Stuart Ritchie, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh, is part of a team that tried, but failed, to replicate those results. Here, he tells the Chronicle of Higher Education’s Tom Bartlett about the difficulties he’s had getting the results published.


Several journals told the team they wouldn’t publish a study that did no more than disprove a previous study. . . . An editor at another journal said he’d “only accept our paper if we ran a fourth experiment where we got a believer [in ESP] to run all the participants, to control for . . . experimenter effects.”
  
My reaction is, this isn’t as easy a question as it might seem.  At first, one’s reaction might share Ritchie’s frustration that a shoddy paper by Bem got p</p><p>5 0.93310976 <a title="2309-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-02-RStudio_%E2%80%93_new_cross-platform_IDE_for_R.html">597 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-02-RStudio – new cross-platform IDE for R</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The new R environment  RStudio  looks really great, especially for users new to R. In teaching, these are often people new to programming anything, much less statistical models. The R GUIs were different on each platform, with (sometimes modal) windows appearing and disappearing and no unified design. RStudio fixes that and has already found a happy home on my desktop.
 
   
  Initial impressions  
I’ve been using it for the past couple of days. For me, it replaces the niche that R.app held: looking at help, quickly doing something I don’t want to pollute a project workspace with; sometimes data munging, merging, and transforming; and prototyping plots.  RStudio is better than R.app at all of these things.  For actual development and papers, though, I remain wedded to emacs+ess (good old  C-x M-c M-Butterfly ). 
  Favorite features in no particular order   
 plots seamlessly made in new graphics devices. This is huge— instead of one active plot window named something like  quartz(1)  t</p><p>6 0.93125427 <a title="2309-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-24-Analyzing_photon_counts.html">1509 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-24-Analyzing photon counts</a></p>

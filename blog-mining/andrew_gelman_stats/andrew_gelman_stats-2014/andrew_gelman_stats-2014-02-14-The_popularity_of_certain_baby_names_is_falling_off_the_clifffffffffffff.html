I was looking at baby name data last night and I stumbled upon something curious. I follow the  baby names blog  occasionally but not regularly, so I’m not sure if it’s been noticed before. Let me present it like this:  Take the statement…


Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.


(… You can pause and try to guess now. Spoilers to follow.)


Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier).

</p><p>3 I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U. [sent-4, score-0.707]
</p><p>4 )   Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier). [sent-13, score-0.622]
</p><p>5 Former powerhouse names James and John have fallen a bit lately, to #17 and #18, but Jacob and Joshua have surged past them and rank #1 and #3 in the 2000s. [sent-15, score-0.783]
</p><p>6 Lower than any of those is a letter I normally think of as a middle-range (ranking 15 in the ETAOIN SHRDLU):  F occurs in only three top 100 names, all girls (Jennifer, Faith, Sofia). [sent-16, score-0.682]
</p><p>7 And it’s not just that F has the fewest names (other than Q), but they rank lower as well. [sent-19, score-0.728]
</p><p>8 )   The other two letters that occur in fewer than 10 names are P and W. [sent-25, score-0.766]
</p><p>9 W has five names, all boys, but three of them rank in the top ten (Matthew #4, Andrew #7, William #10, Owen, Wyatt). [sent-26, score-0.434]
</p><p>10 The top four P names all use PH to make the F sound. [sent-29, score-0.734]
</p><p>11 Perhaps part of the reason that the F has disappeared from names is that in names people prefer to spell the F sound as PH. [sent-30, score-1.14]
</p><p>12 )   But counting the number of names in the top 100 is a crude way of looking at this. [sent-32, score-0.805]
</p><p>13 Then I’d run that for each single letter for the past 20 years or so, and then I’d draw a graph plotting each letter across time so I could see where the letter rank relative to each other and how they’ve trended. [sent-35, score-1.275]
</p><p>14 SSA provides  complete comma-delimited text files  for each year showing number of births for every name with 5 or more occurrences, so the data is available. [sent-36, score-0.374]
</p><p>15 Other fun fact: A’s dominance of names seems to be increasing. [sent-43, score-0.57]
</p><p>16 I didn’t count all 100 for the 2000s, but in the top 10 male and female names for 2012, 19 of 20 contain the letter A. [sent-44, score-1.2]
</p><p>17 I suppose you could do it either way, but I’m thinking in terms of the name contains the letter or it doesn’t, not how many times. [sent-49, score-0.503]
</p><p>18 Like it would be interesting to say “75% of all boys born in 2012 have an A in their name”, but not so much to say, “In the first names of the 2,000,000 boys born in 2012, the letter A occurs 1,600,000 times”. [sent-51, score-1.413]
</p><p>19 Or to put it another way, I’m not interested in letter frequency per se across the limited text corpus of baby names. [sent-54, score-0.558]
</p><p>20 So if there were a trend for names to become longer, in my conception all the frequencies would go up as a result, whereas in the other conception they’re essentially relative frequencies so it would be zero sum. [sent-56, score-0.975]

<p>Introduction: In our Cliff  thread  from yesterday, sociologist Philip Cohen pointed to  his discussions  in the decline in the popularity of the name Mary.
 
One thing that came up was the traditional trendiness of girls’ names.  So I thought I’d share my thoughts from a couple of years ago, as  reported  by David Leonhardt:
  
Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia and an amateur name-ologist, argues that many parents want their boys to seem mature and so pick classic names. William, David, Joseph and James, all longtime stalwarts, remain in the Top 20.


With girls, Gelman says, parents are attracted to names that convey youth even into adulthood and choose names that seem to be on the upswing. By the 1990s, of course, not many girls from the 1880s were still around, and that era’s names could seem fresh again. This search for youthfulness makes girls’ names more volatile — and increasingly so, as more statistics about names become available and parents grow more willing to experiment</p><p>3 0.25807148 <a title="2211-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-R_sucks.html">1919 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-R sucks</a></p>

I was looking at baby name data last night and I stumbled upon something curious. I follow the  baby names blog  occasionally but not regularly, so I’m not sure if it’s been noticed before. Let me present it like this:  Take the statement…


Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.


(… You can pause and try to guess now. Spoilers to follow.)


Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier).  J is heavily overrepresented, especial</p><p>2 0.94236034 <a title="2211-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-13-Can_you_write_a_program_to_determine_the_causal_order%3F.html">1801 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-13-Can you write a program to determine the causal order?</a></p>

Kaggle.com has launched a  competition  to determine what’s an effect and what’s a cause. They’ve got correlated variables, they’re deprived of context, and you’re asked to determine the causal order.  $5,000 prizes.
  
I followed the link and the example they gave didn’t make much sense to me (the two variables were temperature and altitude of cities in Germany, and they said that altitude causes temperature).  It has the feeling to me of one of those weird standardized tests we used to see sometimes in school, where there’s no real correct answer so the goal is to figure out what the test-writer wanted you to say.
 
Nonetheless, this might be of interest, so I’m passing it along to you.</p><p>3 0.93635309 <a title="2211-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-Going_negative.html">1918 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-Going negative</a></p>

I have measured total phosphorus, TP, on a number of dialysis patients, and also measured conventional phosphate, Pi. Now P is exchanged with the environment as Pi, so in principle a correlation between TP and Pi could perhaps be expected. I’m really most interested in the fraction of TP which is not Pi, that is TP-Pi. I would also expect that to be positively correlated with Pi. However, looking at the data using a mixed model an insignificant negative correlation is obtained. Then I thought, that since TP-Pi is bound to be small if Pi is large a negative correlation is almost dictated by the math even if the biology would have it otherwise in so far as the the TP-Pi, likely organic P, must someday have been Pi. Hence I thought about correcting the slight negative correlation between TP-Pi and Pi for the expected large negative correlation due to the math – to eventually recover what I came from: a positive correlation. People seems to agree that this thinki</p><p>4 0.93565071 <a title="2211-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-17-Macro_causality.html">807 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-17-Macro causality</a></p>

 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics.  The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money.  But how do we know it’s not the reverse:  that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well.  As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true.  What I’d call the demand-side story (more spending leads to more output) is everywhere, including this piece, from the usually reliable David Leonhardt.
  
This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?
 
Regarding the causal question, I’d like to move away from the idea of “Does A causes B or does B cause A” and toward a more intervention-based framework (Rubin’s model for</p><p>5 0.93451208 <a title="2211-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-14-Reproducibility_in_Practice.html">907 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-14-Reproducibility in Practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In light of the recent  article  about drug-target research and replication (Andrew blogged it  here ) and  l’affaire   Potti , I have mentioned the  “Forensic Bioinformatics” paper  (Baggerly & Coombes 2009) to several colleagues in passing this week. I have concluded that it has not gotten the attention it deserves, though it has been  discussed  on this blog before too.

The authors try to reproduce published data, and end up “reverse engineering” what the original authors had to have done. Some examples:
  
 §2.2: “Training data sensitive/resistant labels are reversed.” 
 §2.4: “Only 84/122 test samples are distinct; some samples are labeled both sensitive and resistant.” 
 §2.7: Almost half of the data is incorrectly labeled resistant. 
 §3.2: “This offset involves a single row shift: for example, … [data from] row 98 were used instead of those from row 97.”

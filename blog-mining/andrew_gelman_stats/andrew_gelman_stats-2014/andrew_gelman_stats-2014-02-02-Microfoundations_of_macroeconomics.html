<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi writes the above in a  discussion  of a misunderstanding of the economics of Keynes.
 
The discussion is interesting.  According to Sethi, Keynes wrote that, in a depression, nominal wages might be sticky but in any case a decline in wages would not do the trick to increase hiring.  But many modern economics writers have missed this. For example, Gary Becker writes, “Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in the downward direction. . . .

<p>Introduction: John Sides  followed up  on a discussion of his  earlier claim  that political independents vote for president in a reasonable way based on economic performance.  John’s original post led to the amazing claim by New Republic writer Jonathan Chait that John wouldn’t “even want to be friends with anybody who” voted in this manner.
 
I’ve been sensitive to discussions of rationality and voting ever since Aaron Edlin, Noah Kaplan, and I wrote  our article  on voting as a rational choice:  why and how people vote to improve the well-being of others.
 
Models of rationality are controversial In politics, just as they are in other fields ranging from economics to criminology.  On one side you have people trying to argue that all behavior is rational, from lottery playing to drug addiction to engaging in email with exiled Nigerian royalty.  Probably the only behavior that nobody has yet to claim is rational is blogging, but I bet that’s coming too.

<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>5 0.12727386 <a title="2195-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-23-That_odd_couple%2C_%E2%80%9Csubjectivity%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Crationality%E2%80%9D.html">921 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-23-That odd couple, “subjectivity” and “rationality”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nowadays “Bayesian” is often taken to be a synonym for rationality, and I can see how this can irritate thoughtful philosophers and statisticians alike: To start with, lots of rational thinking—even lots of rational statistical inference—does not occur within the Bayesian formalism. And, to look at it from the other direction, lots of self-proclaimed Bayesian inference hardly seems rational at all.  And in what way is “subjective probability” a model for rational scientific inquiry? On the contrary, subjectivity and rationality are in many ways opposites!  [emphasis added]


The goal of this paper is to break the link between Bayesian modeling (good, in my opinion) and subjectivity (bad). From this perspective, the irritation of falsificationists regarding exaggerated claims of Bayesian rationality are my ally. . . .

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.
 
P.S.  Perhaps this will clarify:  In a typical economics research pap</p><p>5 0.75060105 <a title="2195-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-11-Yes%2C_the_decision_to_try_%28or_not%29_to_have_a_child_can_be_made_rationally.html">1758 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-11-Yes, the decision to try (or not) to have a child can be made rationally</a></p>

But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>6 0.74032736 <a title="2195-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-Economists_don%E2%80%99t_think_like_accountants%E2%80%94but_maybe_they_should.html">922 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-Economists don’t think like accountants—but maybe they should</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following email the other day:
  
Given your past criticisms of this issue in your posts, I do not think you will like  my co-authored paper , “Microfoundations of the Business Cycle and Monetary Shocks” . . .
  
Given this lead-in, of course I had to take a look.  The paper is by James Holmes, John Holmes, and Patricia Hutton, it’s called “Microfoundations of the Business Cycle and Monetary Shocks,” and they say:
  
Non-rational expectations can produce larger expected real income for some or all agents than rational expectations. . . . Hence, “rational expectations” are not rational, and “money illusion” can be optimal and satisfy the “Lucas Critique.” . . . Nominal wage rigidity or stickiness can be the rational response of firms or workers and need not be evidence of money illusion.
  
I asked Holmes why he thought I would not like the paper, as I am not opposed to microfoundations when they are of interest.  My  opposition  is to the attitude that microfoundations a</p><p>2 0.93301666 <a title="2195-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-21-Roller_coasters%2C_charity%2C_profit%2C_hmmm.html">157 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-21-Roller coasters, charity, profit, hmmm</a></p>

 Here  is a very interesting article form Science that reports result of experiment that looked at whether people bought a product (picture of themselves screaming or vomiting on roller coaster) or paid more for it when told “1/2 to charity.” Answer was “buy more” but “pay lots 
less” than when alternative was fixed price w/ or w/o charity; and “buy more”  & “pay more” if consumer could name own price & 1/2 went to charity than if none went to charity. Pretty interesting.
  
But . . .
  
 
What’s odd, I [Kahan] think, is the measure used to report the result. The paper (written by some really amazingly good social psychologists; I know this from other studies) goes on & on, w/ figures & tables, about how the amusement park’s “revenue,” “revenue per ride” & “profit” went up by large amount when it used “name your own price & 1/2 to charity.” Yet that result is dominated by random effects — the marginal cost & volume of sales are peculiar to the product being sold &</p><p>3 0.92203236 <a title="2195-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-08-Is_linear_regression_unethical_in_that_it_gives_more_weight_to_cases_that_are_far_from_the_average%3F.html">1409 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-08-Is linear regression unethical in that it gives more weight to cases that are far from the average?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following note from someone who’d like to remain anonymous: 
  
  
I read  your post  on ethics and statistics, and the comments therein, with much interest.


I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?


I guess this gets me partly into loss f</p><p>4 0.9178623 <a title="2195-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-19-Prior_distributions_on_derived_quantities_rather_than_on_parameters_themselves.html">1946 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-19-Prior distributions on derived quantities rather than on parameters themselves</a></p>

One thing I meant by my initial query (but really didn’t manage to get across) was this: I have no idea what my prior would be on many many models, but just like Utility Theory expects ALL consumers to attach a utility to any and all consumption goods (even those I haven’t seen or heard of), Bayesian Stats (almost) expects the same for priors. (Of course it’s not a religious edict much in the way Utility Theory has, since there is no theory of a “modeler” in the Bayesian paradigm—nonetheless there is still an expectation that we should have priors over all sorts of parameters which mean almost nothing to us).


For most models with sufficient complexity, I also have no idea what my informative priors are actually doing and the only way to know anything is through something I can see and experience, through data, not parameters or state variables.

<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design. The paper also presents some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories. This evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or</p><p>6 0.91402626 <a title="2195-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-31-Statistical_modeling%2C_causal_inference%2C_and_social_science.html">1645 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-31-Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science</a></p>

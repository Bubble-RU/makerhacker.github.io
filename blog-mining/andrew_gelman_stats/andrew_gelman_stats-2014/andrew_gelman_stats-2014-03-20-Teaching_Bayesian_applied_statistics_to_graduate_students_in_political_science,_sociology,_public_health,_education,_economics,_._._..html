<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points us to  an article  by Shaaron Ainsworth, Vaughan Prain, and Russell Tytler:
  
Should science learners be challenged to draw more? Certainly making visualizations is integral to scientific thinking. Scientists do not use words only but rely on diagrams, graphs, videos, photographs, and other images to make discoveries, explain findings, and excite public interest. . . . However, in the science classroom, learners mainly focus on interpreting others’ visualizations; when drawing does occur, it is rare that learners are systematically encouraged to create their own visual forms to develop and show understanding (6). Drawing includes constructing a line graph from a table of values, sketching cells observed through a microscope, or inventing a way to show a scientific phenomenon (e.g., evaporation). Although interpretation of visualizations and other information is clearly critical to learning, becoming proficient in science also requires learners to develop many</p><p>3 0.12106251 <a title="2256-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-19-Grad_students%3A__Participate_in_an_online_survey_on_statistics_education.html">1813 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-19-Grad students:  Participate in an online survey on statistics education</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joan Garfield, a leading researcher in statistics education, is conducting a survey of graduate students who teach or assist with the teaching of statistics.  She writes: 
  
  
We want to invite them to take a short survey that will enable us to collect some baseline data that we may use in a grant proposal we are developing.  The project would provide summer workshops and ongoing support for graduate students who will be teaching or assisting with teaching introductory statistics classes. If the grant is funded, we would invite up to 40 students from around the country who are entering graduate programs in statistics to participate in a three-year training and support program.  The goal of this program is to help these students become expert and flexible teachers of statistics, and to support them as they move through their teaching experiences as graduate students.

<p>Introduction: April Galyardt writes:
  
I’m teaching my first graduate class this semester. It’s intro stats for graduate students in the college of education. Most of the students are first year PhD students. Though, there are a number of master’s students who are primarily in-service teachers. The difficulties with teaching an undergraduate intro stats course are still present, in that mathematical preparation and phobia vary widely across the class.


I’ve been enjoying the class and the students, but I’d like your take on an issue I’ve been thinking about. How do I balance teaching the standard methods, like hypothesis testing, that these future researchers have to know because they are so standard, with discussing the problems with those methods (e.g.  p-value as a measure of sample size , and  the decline effect , not to mention multiple testing and other common mistakes).

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: For “humanity, devotion to truth and inspiring leadership” at Columbia College.  Reading Jenny’s  remarks  (“my hugest and most helpful pool of colleagues was to be found not among the ranks of my fellow faculty but in the classroom. . . . we shared a sense of the excitement of the enterprise on which we were all embarked”) reminds me of the comment Seth made once, that the usual goal of university teaching is to make the students into carbon copies of the instructor, and that he found it to me much better to make use of the students’ unique strengths.  This can’t  always  be true–for example, in learning to speak a foreign language, I just want to be able to do it, and my own experiences in other domains is not so relevant.  But for a worldly subject such as literature or statistics or political science, then, yes, I do think it would be good for students to get involved and use their own knowledge and experiences.

<p>Introduction: This recent story  of a wacky psychology professor reminds me of  this old story  of a wacky psychology professor.
 
 This story  of a wacky philosophy professor reminds me of a course I almost took at MIT.  I was looking through the course catalog one day and saw that Thomas Kuhn was teaching a class in the philosophy of science.  Thomas Kuhn–wow!  So I enrolled in the class.  I only sat through one session before dropping it, though.  Kuhn just stood up there and mumbled.
 
At the time, this annoyed me a little.  In retrospect, though, it made more sense.  I’m sure he felt he had better things to do with his life than teach classes.  And MIT was paying him whether or not he did a good job teaching, so it’s not like he was breaking his contract or anything.  (Given the range of instructors we had at MIT, it was always a good idea to make use of the shopping period at the beginning of the semester.

Respected Professor Gelman 


I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). I am currently in the 8th Semester of my Master of Science (Integrated) in Mathematics and Scientific Computing program. I went through some of your previous work and found it to be very interesting, especially ‘Discussion of the article “website morphing”‘. I am interested in working under your guidance in a full time research during this summer (May 2014 – July 2014)


I have a deep interest in Economics (especially Game Theory), Applied Mathematics and Statistics and I have consistently performed well in many courses. My past research experience convinced me of my potential for research and I am in search of an opportunity under your guidance to hone my analytic and research skills


As evident from my resume, most of my work till now hovers around analysis and application of abstract ideas, where in mos</p><p>3 0.98890781 <a title="2256-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-Evaluating_Columbia_University%E2%80%99s_Frontiers_of_Science_course.html">1864 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-Evaluating Columbia University’s Frontiers of Science course</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Frontiers of Science is a course offered as part of Columbia University’s Core Curriculum.  The course is controversial, with some people praising its overview of several areas of science, and others feeling that a more traditional set of introductory science courses would do the job better.
 
Last month, the faculty in charge of the course wrote the following public  letter : 
  
  
The United States is in the midst of a debate over the value of a traditional college education. Why enroll in a place like Columbia College when you can obtain an undergraduate degree for $10,000 or learn everything from Massive Open Online Courses? In more parochial terms, what is the value added by approaches such as Columbia’s Core Curriculum? Recently students in our Core Course, Frontiers of Science (FoS), provided a partial answer. The FoS faculty designed a survey to gauge the scientific skills and knowledge of the Class of 2016 both before and after taking FoS.

Suppose I fit a two stage regression model


Y = a + bx + e 
a = cw + d + e1


I could fit it all in one step by using MCMC for example (my model is more complicated than that, so I’ll have to do it by MCMC). However, I could fit the first regression only using MCMC because those estimates are hard to obtain and perform the second regression using least squares or a separate MCMC. 


So there’s an ‘one step’ inference based on doing it all at the same time and a ‘two step’ inference by fitting one and using the estimates on the further steps. What is gained or lost between both? Is anything done in this question?
  
My response:
 
Rather than answering your particular question, I’ll give you my generic answer, which is to simulate fake data from your model, then fit your model both ways and see how the results differ.  Repeat the simulation a few thousand times and you can make all the statistical comparisons you like.</p><p>5 0.98701453 <a title="2256-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Robert_Kosara_reviews_Ed_Tufte%E2%80%99s_short_course.html">1451 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Robert Kosara reviews Ed Tufte’s short course</a></p>

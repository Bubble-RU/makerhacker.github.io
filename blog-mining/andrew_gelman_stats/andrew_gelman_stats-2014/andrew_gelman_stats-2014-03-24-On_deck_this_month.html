<p>Introduction: OK, I’ve given up on  theme weeks .  I have enough saved-up material to do it, and it wouldn’t be too much trouble to group the scheduled posts into themes, but there doesn’t really seem to be a point.  I say this because, having looked at the comment threads from the past few weeks, the comments seem pretty much tied to individual posts in any case.  So I think I’ll go back to the old system where each post stands alone.
 
Just for fun I thought I’d run a week’s worth of old posts, just some things I came across when searching for various things.  Of course I could just post the links right here but instead I’ll repost with my comments on how things have changed in the intervening years.

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

In their March 9 “ counterpoint ” in nature biotech to the prospect that we should try to integrate more sources of data in clinical practice (see “ point ” arguing for this), Isaac Kohane and David Margulies claim that,


“Finally, how much better is our new knowledge than older knowledge? When is the incremental benefit of a genomic variant(s) or gene expression profile relative to a family history or classic histopathology insufficient and when does it add rather than subtract variance?”  


Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability. That is, if you have a hierarchical model, and the family history / classical histopathology already suggests a parameter estimate with some variance, how could the new genomic info possibly increase the variance of that parameter estimate? Surely the question is how much variance the new genomic info reduces and whether it therefore justifies t</p><p>4 0.93899864 <a title="2264-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-News_coverage_of_statistical_issues%E2%80%A6how_did_I_do%3F.html">514 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-News coverage of statistical issues…how did I do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

<p>Introduction: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data :
  
We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation</p><p>6 0.93261153 <a title="2264-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-A_defense_of_Tom_Wolfe_based_on_the_impossibility_of_the_law_of_small_numbers_in_network_structure.html">1615 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-A defense of Tom Wolfe based on the impossibility of the law of small numbers in network structure</a></p>

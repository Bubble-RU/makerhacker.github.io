<p>Introduction: Hermann Goering is famous for two things:
 
1.  Being an air force general, and
 
2.  Being a really bad air force general.
 
What does this have to do, you may ask, with Jane Jacobs, who is famous for a book she wrote in the early 1960s advocating small, mixed-use street-level city development, in contrast to the mega-projects that were advocated by many influential planners at the time.
 
The connection is, as a London-based friend pointed out to me the other day, that the German bombing of London in WW2 knocked out random sections all over the city, which were then often replaced by various public developments.  The knocked-out portions were often small, so there was not always room for megablocks to replace them, and they were scattered—so the new housing was also distributed haphazardly all over the city.
 
Thus, Goering helped in two ways, corresponding to the two numbered points listed above:
 
1.  His air force dropped bombs and destroyed buildings all over London.
 
2.  His at</p><p>3 0.08541698 <a title="2165-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-18-Hierarchical_modeling_as_a_framework_for_extrapolation.html">1383 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-18-Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Phil recently  posted  on the challenge of extrapolation of inferences to new data.  After telling the story of a colleague who flat-out refused to make predictions from his model of buildings to new data, Phil wrote, “This is an interesting problem because it is sort of outside the realm of statistics, and into some sort of meta-statistical area. How can you judge whether your results can be extrapolated to the ‘real world,’ if you cant get a real-world sample to compare to?”
 
In reply, I wrote:
  
I agree that this is an important and general problem, but I don’t think it is outside the realm of statistics! I think that one useful statistical framework here is multilevel modeling. Suppose you are applying a procedure to J cases and want to predict case J+1 (in this case, the cases are buildings and J=52). Let the parameters be theta_1,…,theta_{J+1}, with data y_1,…,y_{J+1}, and case-level predictors X_1,…,X_{J+1}.

<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.
 
 Fernando:   Incentives? Impact factors? Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . .

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
I was re-reading your and Shalizi’s  “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics”  [see also the  rejoinder ] and noticed a statement near the end of section 6 about paradigm shifts coming in different magnitudes over different time spans.  That reminded me of the almost-mystical ideas surrounding 1/f (f being frequency”) noise in some areas — the notion that almost everything exhibits that effect, and that effect extends to arbitrarily low f.  (I sense the idea only gets mystical when f gets low enough so that the event that may happen stochastically is really big—say, you model the height of waves in the Atlantic as 1/f and discover that, at some low frequency, Bermuda becomes submerged.  In other words, does the same mechanism that accounts for physical vibrations in the range of Hertz also account for the creation and destruction of islands that may occur in the range of reciprocal centuries?)

<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.  I can’t believe anyone has such a precise estimate of the health effects of pesticides, and also I can’t believe anyone has such a precise effect of the health effect of eating an app</p><p>3 0.83239478 <a title="2165-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-01-Why_big_effects_are_more_important_than_small_effects.html">1744 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-01-Why big effects are more important than small effects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this post is silly but I have an important point to make, regarding an implicit model which I think many people assume even though it does not really make sense.
 
Following a link from Sanjay Srivastava, I came across  a post  from David Funder saying that it’s useful to talk about the sizes of effects (I actually prefer the term “comparisons” so as to avoid the causal baggage) rather than just their signs.  I  agree , and I wanted to elaborate a bit on a point that comes up in Funder’s discussion.  He quotes an (unnamed) prominent social psychologist as writing:
  
The key to our research . . . [is not] to accurately estimate effect size. If I were testing an advertisement for a marketing research firm and wanted to be sure that the cost of the ad would produce enough sales to make it worthwhile, effect size would be crucial. But when I am testing a theory about whether, say, positive mood reduces information processing in comparison with negative mood, I am worried abou</p><p>4 0.82512414 <a title="2165-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-18-Question_on_Type_M_errors.html">963 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-18-Question on Type M errors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Inti Pedroso writes:
  
Today during the group meeting at my new job we were revising a paper whose main conclusions were sustained by an ANOVA.


One of the first observations is that the experiment had a small sample size. Interestingly (may not so), some of the reported effects (most of them interactions) were quite large. One of the experience group members said that “there is a common wisdom that one should not believe effects from small sample sizes but [he thinks] if they [the effects] are large enough to be picked on a small study they must be real large effects”. I argued that if the sample size is small one could incur on a M-type error in which the magnitude of the effect is being over-estimated and that if larger samples are evaluated the magnitude may become smaller and also the confidence intervals. The concept of M-type error is completely new to all other members of the group (on which I am in my second week) and I was given the job of finding a suitable ref to explain</p><p>5 0.80957359 <a title="2165-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-29-Decline_Effect_in_Linguistics%3F.html">1400 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-29-Decline Effect in Linguistics?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Josef Fruehwald  writes :
  
In the past few years, the empirical foundations of the social sciences, especially Psychology, have been coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. For example, there was the New Yorker piece from 2010 called “The Truth Wears Off” about the “decline effect,” or how the effect size of a phenomenon appears to decrease over time. . . .


I [Fruehwald] am a linguist. Do the problems facing psychology face me? To really answer that, I first have to decide which explanation for the decline effect I think is most likely, and I think Andrew Gelman’s proposal is a good candidate:

 
The short story is that if you screen for statistical significance when estimating small effects, you will necessarily overestimate the magnitudes of effects, sometimes by a huge amount.

<p>Introduction: I know we have some readers in the L.A. area and you might be interested in a comment on our recent post regarding the beneficial (in a Jane Jacobs sense) effects of selective devastation of micro-neighborhoods in a city.  I  gave  the example of London after the fractal effects of bombing in WW2, and BMGM  wrote :
  
I have another case study for you.


The Northridge earthquake knocked out a great many apartment buildings in the San Fernando Valley (SFV part of LA) in 1994. Destruction was uneven for several reasons. “Soft story” buildings were particularly vulnerable and that type of design was common in small apartment complexes. The waves reflected off the nearby granite mountain ranges and formed an interference pattern across the alluvial plain/valley. This caused scattered destruction over a wide area.


The SFV has enjoyed a renaissance after the quake. It’s residents enjoy some of the highest Walkscores in California–comparable to San Francisco.

Drawing from My Mind’s Eye: 
Dorothea Rockburne in Conversation with David Cohen 
Introduced by Nina Samuel
 
Thursday, November 29 
6 pm 
BGC, 38 West 86th Street
 
Benoît Mandelbrot, unusual among mathematicians of the twentieth century, harnessed the power of visual images to express his theories and to pursue new lines of thought. In this conversation artist Dorothea Rockburne will share memories of studying with mathematician Max Dehn at Black Mountain College, of meeting Mandelbrot, and discuss her recent work.
 
Exhibition curator Nina Samuel will discuss the related exhibition “The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking,” on view in the BGC Focus Gallery through January 27, 2013.
 
  
   
David Cohen is editor and publisher of artcritical.com as well as founder and moderator of The Review Panel.

<p>Introduction: I’m a few weeks behind in my New Yorker reading and so just recently read  this fascinating article  by Ryan Lizza on the current administration’s foreign policy.  He gives some insights into the transformation Obama from antiwar candidate to a president conducting three wars.
 
Speaking as a statistician, though, what grabbed my eye was a doctrine of journalist/professor/policymaker Samantha Power.  Lizza writes:
  
In 2002, after graduating from Harvard Law School, she wrote “A Problem from Hell,” which surveyed the grim history of six genocides committed in the twentieth century. Propounding a liberal-interventionist view, Power argued that “mass killing” on the scale of Rwanda or Bosnia must be prevented by other nations, including the United States. She wrote that America and its allies rarely have perfect information about when a regime is about to commit genocide; a President, therefore, must have “a bias toward belief” that massacres are imminent.

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.

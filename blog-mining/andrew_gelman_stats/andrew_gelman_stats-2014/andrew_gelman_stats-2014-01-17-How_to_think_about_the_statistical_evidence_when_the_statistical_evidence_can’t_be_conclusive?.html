<p>Introduction: About 12 years ago Greg Wawro, Sy Spilerman, and I started a M.A. program here in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences, jointly between the departments of history, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and statistics.  We created a bunch of new features for the program, including an interdisciplinary course based on  this book .
  

 
And here’s their new logo:
 
 
 
Don’t blame me for the pie-chart motif!  Seriously, though, the program is great.  I’m proud to have gotten it started, and I’m impressed by the progress that Chris Weiss and others have made in expanding the program during the past decade.</p><p>3 0.12847298 <a title="2174-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-28-Economists_argue_about_Bayes.html">1695 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-28-Economists argue about Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>5 0.12329349 <a title="2174-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-05-Evidence_on_the_impact_of_sustained_use_of_polynomial_regression_on_causal_inference_%28a_claim_that_coal_heating_is_reducing_lifespan_by_5_years_for_half_a_billion_people%29.html">1968 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-05-Evidence on the impact of sustained use of polynomial regression on causal inference (a claim that coal heating is reducing lifespan by 5 years for half a billion people)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yu Xie thought I’d have something to say about  this recent paper , “Evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy from China’s Huai River policy,” by Yuyu Chen, Avraham Ebenstein, Michael Greenstone, and Hongbin Li, which begins:
  
This paper’s findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China’s Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectanci</p><p>6 0.12239176 <a title="2174-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-09-Commercial_Bayesian_inference_software_is_popping_up_all_over.html">1489 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-09-Commercial Bayesian inference software is popping up all over</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reacted  (see further discussion in comments  here ) to a recent study on early childhood intervention, in which researchers Paul Gertler, James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Arianna Zanolini, Christel Vermeerch, Susan Walker, Susan M. Chang, and Sally Grantham-McGregor estimated that a particular intervention on young children had raised incomes on young adults by 42%.  I wrote:
  
Major decisions on education policy can turn on the statistical interpretation of small, idiosyncratic data sets — in this case, a study of 129 Jamaican children. . . . Overall, I have no reason to doubt the direction of the effect, namely, that psychosocial stimulation should be good. But I’m skeptical of the claim that income differed by 42%, due to the reason of  the statistical significance filter . In section 2.3, the authors are doing lots of hypothesizing based on some comparisons being statistically significant and others being non-significant. There’s nothing wrong with speculation, b</p><p>3 0.80618924 <a title="2174-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Controversy_about_average_personality_differences_between_men_and_women.html">1114 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Controversy about average personality differences between men and women</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).
  
Echidne  quotes  a  news article  in which one of the study’s authors going overboard:

<p>Introduction: We recently considered a pair of studies that came out awhile ago involving children and political orientation: Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely to support left-wing parties, compared to parents of boys. And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys.
 
As I  discussed  the other day, the latest version of the Conley and Raucher study came with some incoherent evolutionary theorizing.  There was also some discussion regarding the differences between the two studies.
 
Oswald sent me some relevant comments:
  
It will be hard in cross-sections like the GSS to solve the problem of endogeneity bias. Conservative families may want to have boys, and may use that as a stopping rule.  If so, they will end up with disproportionately large number of girls.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Lumley  writes :
  
 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>6 0.79464173 <a title="2174-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-17-%E2%80%9CStop_and_frisk%E2%80%9D_statistics.html">1942 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-17-“Stop and frisk” statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following message from “Patricia Lopez” of “Premium Link Ads”:
  
Hello,


I am interested in placing a text link on your page: http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/. The link would point to a page on a website that is relevant to your page and may be useful to your site visitors. We would be happy to compensate you for your time if it is something we are able to work out.


The best way to reach me is through a direct response to this email. This will help me get back to you about the right link request. Please let me know if you are interested, and if not thanks for your time. Thanks.
  
Usually I just ignore these, but after our recent  discussion  I decided to reply.  I wrote:
  
How much do you pay?
  
But no answer.  I wonder what’s going on?  I mean, why bother sending the email in the first place if you’re not going to follow up?</p><p>2 0.96770352 <a title="2174-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-18-Understanding_posterior_p-values.html">2029 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-18-Understanding posterior p-values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Kaplan writes:
  
I came across your  paper  “Understanding Posterior Predictive P-values”, and I have a question regarding your statement “If a posterior predictive p-value is 0.4, say, that means that, if we believe the model, we think there is a 40% chance that tomorrow’s value of T(y_rep) will exceed today’s T(y).” This is perfectly understandable to me and represents the idea of calibration.  However, I am unsure how this relates to statements about fit.  If T is the LR chi-square or Pearson chi-square, then your statement that there is a 40% chance that tomorrows value exceeds today’s value indicates bad fit, I think.  Yet, some literature indicates that high p-values suggest good fit.  Could you clarify this?
  
My reply:
 
I think that “fit” depends on the question being asked.  In this case, I’d say the model fits for this particular purpose, even though it might not fit for other purposes.

<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>4 0.96271783 <a title="2174-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-R_needs_a_good_function_to_make_line_plots.html">252 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-R needs a good function to make line plots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: More and more I’m thinking that line plots are great.  More specifically, two-way grids of line plots on common scales, with one, two, or three lines per plot (enough to show comparisons but not so many that you can’t tell the lines apart).  Also dot plots, of the sort that have been masterfully used by Lax and Phillips to show comparisons and trends in support for gay rights.
 
There’s a big step missing, though, and that is to be able to make these graphs as a default.  We have to figure out the right way to structure the data so these graphs come naturally.
 
Then when it’s all working, we can talk the Excel people into implementing our ideas.  I’m not asking to be paid here; all our ideas are in the public domain and I’m happy for Microsoft or Google or whoever to copy us.

<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.

What makes the designer want to tilt the reader’s head?


This chart is unreadable. It also fails the self-sufficiency test. All 13 data points are printed onto the chart. You really don’t need the axis, and the gridlines.


A further design flaw is the use of signposts. Our eyes are drawn to the hexagons containing the brand icons but the data is at the other end of the signpost, where it is planted on the surface!


Here is a sketch of something not as cute:

 Here’s  my candidate for bad graphic of the year:


   


I [Seth] studied it and learned nothing. I have no idea how they assigned colors to locations. I already knew that there were more within-city calls than calls to individual distant locations — for example that there are more SF-SF calls than SF-LA calls. The researchers took a huge rich database and boiled it down to nothing (in terms of information value) — and I have a funny feeling they don’t realize how awful this is and what a waste.


I send it to you because it isn’t obvious how to do better — at least not obvious to them.
  
My reply:
 
My first reaction is to agree–I don’t get anything out of this graph either! But let me step back.
 
I think it’s best to understand this using the framework of  my paper with Antony Unwin , by thinking of the goals that are satisfied by different sorts of graphs.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  writes :
  
I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!

<p>Introduction: 1.  I  remarked  that Sharad had a good research article with some ugly graphs.
 
2.  Dan  posted  Sharad’s graph and some unpleasant alternatives, inadvertently associating me with one of the unpleasant alternatives.  Dan was comparing barplots with dotplots.
 
3.  I  commented  on Dan’s site that, in this case, I’d much prefer a well-designed lineplot.  I wrote:
  
There’s a principle in decision analysis that the most important step is not the evaluation of the decision tree but the decision of what options to include in the tree in the first place.


I think that’s what’s happening here. You’re seriously limiting yourself by considering the above options, which really are all the same graph with just slight differences in format. What you need to do is break outside the box.

What they did right:


- Did not put the data on a map 
- Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically 
- Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel 
- Only used three labels for the 11 years on the plot 
- Did not overdo the vertical scale either


The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go. I would have used smaller fonts throughout.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s comments. I could even add a few more, like using light gray for the backgrounds and a bright blue for the lines, spacing the graphs well, using full country names rather than three-letter abbreviations. There are so many standard mistakes that go into default data displays that it is refreshing to see a simple graph done</p><p>2 0.91904712 <a title="2288-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-09-Rasmussen_sez%3A__%E2%80%9C108%25_of_Respondents_Say_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">135 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-09-Rasmussen sez:  “108% of Respondents Say . . .”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The recent discussion of pollsters reminded me of  a story  from a couple years ago that perhaps is still relevant . . .
 
I was looking up the governors’ popularity numbers on the web, and came across  this page from Rasmussen Reports  which shows Sarah Palin as the 3rd-most-popular governor. But then I looked more carefully. Janet Napolitano of Arizona was viewed as Excellent by 28% of respondents, Good by 27%, Fair by 26%, and Poor by 27%. That adds up to 108%! What’s going on?
 
I’d think they would have a computer program to pipe the survey results directly into the spreadsheet. But I guess not, someone must be typing in these numbers one at a time.  Another possibility is that they are altering their numbers by hand, and someone made a mistake with the Napolitano numbers, adding a few percent in one place and forgetting to subtract elsewhere.  Or maybe there’s another explanation?

I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution? Do I combine the 5 imputed data set into one by averaging each imputed values so I get one single imputed data and compare with the ob</p><p>4 0.90448052 <a title="2288-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-09-Typo_in_Ghitza_and_Gelman_MRP_paper.html">2095 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-09-Typo in Ghitza and Gelman MRP paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Devin Caughey points out a typo in the second column of page 765 of  our AJPS paper .  Here’s what we have:
 
 
 
The typo is in the third line of the second paragraph above.  Where it says y^*_j = y.bar^*_j n_j, it should be y^*_j = y.bar^*_j n^*_j.
 
 One frustrating system of the current system of journal publication is that I know of no way to append this correction to the published article.  I can put it here, but anyone who misses this is stuck.  And I don’t think the AJPS can link from the article to this post.  I contacted the editor of the AJPS who said there will be no problem appending the correction to the electronic version of the article.</p><p>5 0.90371329 <a title="2288-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

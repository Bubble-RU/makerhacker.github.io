<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>3 0.15969527 <a title="2284-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-23-%E2%80%9CAny_old_map_will_do%E2%80%9D_meets_%E2%80%9CGod_is_in_every_leaf_of_every_tree%E2%80%9D.html">1278 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-23-“Any old map will do” meets “God is in every leaf of every tree”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a statistician I am particularly worried about the rhetorical power of anecdotes (even though I use them in my own reasoning; see discussion below).  But much can be learned from a  true  anecdote.  The rough edges—the places where the anecdote doesn’t fit your thesis—these are where you learn.
 
We have recently had a discussion ( here  and  here ) of Karl Weick, a prominent scholar of business management who plagiarized a story and then went on to draw different lessons from the pilfered anecdote in several different publications published over many years.
 
Setting aside an issues of plagiarism and rulebreaking, I argue that, by hiding the source of the story and changing its form, Weick and his management-science audience are losing their ability to get anything out of it beyond empty confirmation.

<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>5 0.14690603 <a title="2284-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-11-Incumbency_advantage_in_2010.html">408 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-11-Incumbency advantage in 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: “Explanation” is this thing that social scientists (or people in their everyday lives, acting like social scientists) do, where some event X happens and we supply a coherent story that concludes with X.  Sometimes we speak of an event as “overdetermined,” when we can think of many plausible stories that all lead to X.
 
My question today is:  what is explanation, in a statistical sense?
 
To understand why this is a question worth asking at all, compare to prediction.  Prediction is another thing that we all to, typically in a qualitative fashion:  I think she’s gonna win this struggle, I think he’s probably gonna look for a new job, etc.  It’s pretty clear how to map everyday prediction into a statistical framework, and we can think of informal qualitative predictions as approximations to the predictions that could be made by a statistical model (as in the  classic work  of Meehl and others on clinical vs. statistical prediction).

<p>Introduction: Dave Backus points me to  this review  by anthropologist Mike McGovern of two books by economist Paul Collier on the politics of economic development in Africa.  My first reaction was that this was interesting but non-statistical so I’d have to either post it on the sister blog or wait until the 30 days of statistics was over.  But then I looked more carefully and realized that this discussion is very relevant to applied statistics. 
 
Here’s McGovern’s substantive critique:
  
Much of the fundamental intellectual work in Collier’s analyses is, in fact, ethnographic. Because it is not done very self-consciously and takes place within a larger econometric rhetoric in which such forms of knowledge are dismissed as “subjective” or worse still biased by the political (read “leftist”) agendas of the academics who create them, it is often ethnography of a low quality. . . .


Despite the adoption of a Naipaulian unsentimental-dispatches-from-the-trenches rhetoric, the story told in Collier’s</p><p>5 0.70108002 <a title="2284-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form.

Gelman and Basbøll on stories.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In “Story:  A Definition,” visual analysis researcher Robert Kosara  writes :
  
A story

 
 ties facts together. There is a reason why this particular collection of facts is in this story, and the story gives you that reason. 
 provides a narrative path through those facts. In other words, it guides the viewer/reader through the world, rather than just throwing them in there. 
 presents a particular interpretation of those facts. A story is always a particular path through a world, so it favors one way of seeing things over all others. 
 
  
The relevance of these ideas to statistical graphics is apparent.
 
From a completely different direction, in “When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences,” Thomas Basbøll and I  write :
  
Storytelling has long been recognized as central to human cognition and communication. Here we explore a more active role of stories in social science research, not merely to illustrate concepts but also to develop new ideas and evalu</p><p>2 0.98002207 <a title="2284-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-23-When_are_complicated_models_helpful_in_psychology_research_and_when_are_they_overkill%3F.html">1690 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-23-When are complicated models helpful in psychology research and when are they overkill?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Brown is bothered by  this article , “An unscented Kalman filter approach to the estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems models,” by Sy-Miin Chow, Emilio Ferrer, and John Nesselroade.  The introduction of the article cites a bunch of articles in serious psych/statistics journals.  The question is, are such advanced statistical techniques really needed, or even legitimate, with the kind of very rough data that is usually available in psych applications? Or is it just fishing in the hope of discovering patterns that are not really there?
 
I wrote:
 
It seems like a pretty innocuous literature review.  I agree that many of the applications are silly (for example, they cite the work of the notorious  John Gottman  in fitting a predator-prey model to spousal relations (!)), but overall they just seem to be presenting very standard ideas for the mathematical-psychology audience.  It’s not clear whether advanced techniques are always appropriate here, but they come in through a natura</p><p>3 0.97866881 <a title="2284-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-21-Building_a_regression_model_._._._with_only_27_data_points.html">1506 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-21-Building a regression model . . . with only 27 data points</a></p>

I was wondering whether you would have any advice on building a regression model on a very small datasets. I’m in the midst of revamping the model to predict tax collections from unincorporated businesses. But I only have 27 data points, 27 years of annual data.  Any advice would be much appreciated.
  
My reply:
 
This sounds tough, especially given that 27 years of annual data isn’t even 27 independent data points.  
 
I have various essentially orthogonal suggestions:
 
1 [added after seeing John Cook's comment below].  Do your best, making as many assumptions as you need.  In a Bayesian context, this means that you’d use a strong and informative prior and let the data update it as appropriate.  In a less formal setting, you’d start with a guess of a model and then alter it to the extent that your data contradict your original guess.
 
2.  Get more data.  Not by getting information on more years (I assume you can’t do that) but by breaking up the data you do</p><p>4 0.9780606 <a title="2284-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-19-Just_chaid.html">421 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-19-Just chaid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reading somebody else’s statistics rant made me realize the inherent contradictions in much of my own statistical advice.
  

 
Jeff Lax sent along  this article  by Philip Schrodt, along with the cryptic comment:
  
Perhaps of interest to you. perhaps not.  Not meant to be an excuse for you to rant against hypothesis testing again.
  
In his article, Schrodt makes a reasonable and entertaining argument against the overfitting of data and the overuse of linear models.  He states that his article is motivated by the quantitative papers he has been sent to review for journals or conferences, and he explicitly excludes “studies of United States voting behavior,” so at least I think Mister P is off the hook.
 
I notice a bit of incoherence in Schrodt’s position–on one hand, he criticizes “kitchen-sink models” for overfitting and he criticizes “using complex methods without understanding the underlying assumptions” . . . but then later on he suggests that political scientists in this countr</p><p>5 0.97756356 <a title="2284-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy_of_Bayes_and_non-Bayes%3A__A_dialogue_with_Deborah_Mayo.html">291 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy of Bayes and non-Bayes:  A dialogue with Deborah Mayo</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>6 0.97671026 <a title="2284-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>

[sent-3, score-0.294]
</p><p>2 And in case you were wondering what the policy on this was at his institution,  here’s  something from a google search on *matthew whitaker syllabus*:            To be fair, though, this syllabus is from 2003. [sent-5, score-0.743]
</p><p>3 ” He referred further questions to the [University of Nebraska press, which published the book with the copied material]. [sent-10, score-0.274]
</p><p>4 She said the press does not and cannot check everything it publishes for plagiarism and that authors sign a statement saying they have not plagiarized, indemnifying the press from such charges. [sent-15, score-0.496]
</p><p>5 She thinks plagiarism is OK, maybe not for students taking a class, but it’s ok for professors publishing a book with the University of Nebraska Press. [sent-29, score-0.284]
</p><p>6 She doesn’t like plagiarism but she feels that this book is  only a little bit plagiarized . [sent-31, score-0.445]
</p><p>7 But not only has [Whitaker’s] book been through rigorous peer review, knowing that he’s had an issue in the past, he took tremendous pains to make sure that there wasn’t anything that could be questioned in this book. [sent-53, score-0.507]
</p><p>8 But we do have some pieces of information:   (a) Whitaker’s book has been through rigorous peer review. [sent-58, score-0.349]
</p><p>9 (b) Whitaker has been caught copying without attribution in the past. [sent-59, score-0.29]
</p><p>10 And, of course,   (d) Whitaker in his book actually included copies of many long passages from other sources without attribution. [sent-61, score-0.282]
</p><p>11 Based on the evidence shown above and others at that site, we can rule out (i) and (ii), so either the rigorous peer reviewers had bad luck or the peer review was not rigorous. [sent-65, score-0.503]
</p><p>12 Yet another possibility is that the rigorous peer reviewers did notice the plagiarism and told the University of Nebraska Press, but that the publisher chose to set this information aside. [sent-66, score-0.566]
</p><p>13 Now on to statement (b), which seems to be taken by Shear to be evidence against plagiarism, perhaps based on the reasoning that the peer reviewers would have been extra thorough when evaluating the work of a known copyist. [sent-74, score-0.354]
</p><p>14 But,  conditional on the copying actually being there (as is clear from the evidence) , this implies that the reviewers did not look carefully enough (or, again, maybe they did and the press decided to just publish the manuscript as is). [sent-76, score-0.328]
</p><p>15 The information provided by Shear is actually a bit mixed, because she’s reporting that the book is peer-reviewed but also that the author had problems with unacknowledged copying in the past. [sent-85, score-0.337]
</p><p>16 But, in any case, this information is much weaker than the direct data provided by the passages in the book that are so similar to previously published work of others. [sent-86, score-0.33]
</p><p>17 I mean, sure, this is Whitaker’s fault, he’s to blame for, first submitting a book with lots of copied and uncredited material and then not apologizing after he got caught—but, really, what can you expect given what came before? [sent-88, score-0.401]
</p><p>18 I’d think she’d be annoyed at Whitaker for sending her press a book with copied and uncredited material. [sent-90, score-0.452]
</p><p>19 Via email, Joseph said that he was not aware of any of the allegations concerning the new book until contacted by Inside Higher Ed. [sent-97, score-0.268]
</p><p>20 The point is really simpler than that, it’s about publishing a book and giving an award to a book that is copied from other sources. [sent-108, score-0.467]

<p>Introduction: Last month a history professor sent me a note regarding plagiarism at Arizona State University:
  
Matthew Whitaker, who had received an expedited promotion to full professor and was made Director of a new Center for the Study of Race and Democracy by Provost Elizabeth Capaldi and President Michael Crow, was charged by most of the full professors in the History Faculty with having plagiarized throughout his corpus of work, copying from regular works of scholarship and from web sources. Indeed, in his response, which claimed that the petitioners were racist, Whitaker admitted to plagiarism in his work, defending himself in part by stating that he had not reviewed carefully the research and writing he had hired others to do. . . .

<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

Which brings us to Ed Wegman, whose defense of  plagiari</p><p>4 0.16817835 <a title="2334-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader.

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes on what seems to be the  topic  of the  week :
  
In reflecting on  Lehrer , I [Kahan] have to wonder why the sanction is so much more severe — basically career “death penalty” subject to parole [I think he means "life imprisonment" --- ed.], I suppose, if he manages decades of “good behavior” — for this science journalist when scholars who stick plagiarized material in their “popular science” writing don’t even get slap on wrist — more like shrug of the shoulders. I do think the behavior is comparable; if anything, it’s probably “less wrong” to make up innocuous filler quotes (the Dylan one is, for sure), then to stick paragraphs of someone else’s writing into a book. But the cause is the same: laziness. (The plagarism I’m talking about is not the sort done by Wegman; its sort done by scholars who use factory production techniques to write popular press books —  teams of research assistants who write memos, which the “author” then knits together & passes off as learne</p><p>5 0.8220014 <a title="2334-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-That_last_satisfaction_at_the_end_of_the_career.html">1568 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-That last satisfaction at the end of the career</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just finished reading an amusing but somewhat disturbing  article  by Mark Singer, a reporter for the New Yorker who follows in that magazine’s tradition of writing about amiable frauds.  (For those who are keeping score at home, Singer employs a McKelway-style relaxed tolerance rather than Liebling-style pyrotechnics.)  Singer’s topic was a midwestern dentist named Kip Litton who fradulently invented a side career for himself as a sub-3-hour marathoner.  What was amazing was not so much that Litton lied about his accomplishments but, rather, the huge efforts that he undertook to support these lies.  He went to faraway cities to not run marathons.  He fabricated multiple personas on running message boards.  He even invented an entire marathon and made up a list of participants.
 
This got me thinking about Ed Wegman (sorry!), the statistician who got tangled in a  series of plagiarism scandals .  As with Litton, once Wegman was caught once, energetic people looked at the records and</p><p>6 0.82013547 <a title="2334-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Last_Wegman_post_%28for_now%29.html">766 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Last Wegman post (for now)</a></p>

Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching OpenDataLatinoamerica.org, a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.


We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain. Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight International Journalism Fellows.

<p>Introduction: Today’s item mixes two of my favorite themes in a horrible way, sort of like a Reese’s Cup but combining brussels sprouts and liver instead of peanut butter and chocolate.  In this case, the disturbing flavors that go together are  plagiarism  (you know what that is) and  the publication filter  (the  idea  that there should be very stringent standards for criticizing something, once it happens to be published somewhere).
 
 The copyist 
 
The first ingredient comes from Matthew Whitaker, an Arizona State University Foundation Professor of History who has a deplorable record of  copying material from other writers without attribution .
 
For convenience, I’ll  reproduce  an example here:
 
      
 
On the plus side; Whitaker removed the cliche’d phrase, “undisputed rulers of the roost” when copying from the online encyclopedia; on the downside, I don’t know what he was thinking when he rendered “Conservatives” with a capital letter.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: My Columbia colleague Irv Garfinkel recently came out with a book (with coauthors Lee Rainwater and Timothy Smeeding), “Mythbusters:  The U.S. Social Welfare State,” where they argue:
  
The United States is a capitalist nation that has eschewed Scandinavian-style socialist policies in favor of capitalism and economic growth, right? Wrong. The U.S. is not only one of the largest welfare states in the world, but it is strong economically precisely because of its adoption of some socialist policies–with public education as the primary driver.


The American welfare state faces large challenges. Restoring its historical lead in education is the most important but requires investing large sums in education–beginning with universal pre-school–and in complementary programs–including selected cash benefits for families with children–that aid children’s development. The American health insurance system is by far the most costly in the rich world, yet fails to insure one sixth of its population</p><p>5 0.92864788 <a title="2334-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-17-More_on_the_difficulty_of_%E2%80%9Cpreaching_what_you_practice%E2%80%9D.html">1325 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-17-More on the difficulty of “preaching what you practice”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>6 0.92752314 <a title="2334-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-22-Political_Belief_Networks%3A__Socio-cognitive_Heterogeneity_in_American_Public_Opinion.html">1 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-22-Political Belief Networks:  Socio-cognitive Heterogeneity in American Public Opinion</a></p>

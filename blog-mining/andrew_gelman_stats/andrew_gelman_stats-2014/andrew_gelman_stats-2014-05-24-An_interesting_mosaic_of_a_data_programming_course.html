I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.


My question: you are obviously evangelical about the benefits that Bayesian statistics brings, have you ever considered producing a Coursera (or similar) cour</p><p>3 0.11148881 <a title="2345-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Statoverflow.html">223 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Statoverflow</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  previous post , Andrew Wilson writes:
  
I agree we are in a really exciting time for statistics and machine learning.  There has been a lot of talk lately comparing machine learning with statistics.  I am curious whether you think there are many fundamental differences between the fields, or just superficial differences — different popular approximate inference methods, slightly different popular application areas, etc.  Is machine learning a subset of statistics?


In the paper we discuss how we think machine learning is fundamentally about pattern discovery, and ultimately, fully automating the learning and decision making process.  In other words, whatever a human does when he or she uses tools to analyze data, can be written down algorithmically and automated on a computer.  I am not sure if the ambitions are similar in statistics — and I don’t have any conventional statistics background, which makes it harder to tell. I think it’s an interesting discussion.</p><p>5 0.10434968 <a title="2345-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-The_Road_to_a_B.html">515 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-The Road to a B</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student in my intro class came by the other day with a lot of questions.  It soon became clear that he was confused about a lot of things, going back several weeks in the course.  What this means is that we did not do a good job of monitoring his performance earlier during the semester.  But the question now is:  what do do next?  I’ll sign the drop form any time during the semester, but he didn’t want to drop the class (the usual scheduling issues).  And he doesn’t want to get a C or a D.  He’s in big trouble and at this point is basically rolling the dice that he’ll do well enough on the final to eke out a B in the course.  (Yes, he goes to section meetings and office hours, and he even tried hiring a tutor.  But it’s tough–if you’ve already been going to class and still don’t know what’s going on, it’s not so easy to pull yourself out of the hole, even if you have a big pile of practice problems ahead of you.)

<p>Introduction: After reading Rachel and Cathy’s  book , I  wrote  that “Statistics is the least important part of data science . . . I think it would be fair to consider statistics as a subset of data science. . . . it’s not the most important part of data science, or even close.”
 
But then I received “Data Science for Business,” by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett, in the mail.  I might not have opened the book at all (as I’m hardly in the target audience) but for seeing a blurb by Chris Volinsky, a statistician whom I respect a lot.
 
So I flipped through the book and it indeed looked pretty good.  It moves slowly but that’s appropriate for an intro book.  But what surprised me, given the book’s title and our recent discussion on the nature of data science, was that the book was 100% statistics!   It had some math (for example, definitions of various distance measures), some simple algebra, some conceptual graphs such as ROC curve, some tables and graphs of low-dimensional data summaries—but almost</p><p>6 0.75392824 <a title="2345-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-20-Job_opening_at_an_organization_that_promotes_reproducible_research%21.html">1990 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-20-Job opening at an organization that promotes reproducible research!</a></p>

I have been working on a website, SlideRule that in its present state, is a catalog of online courses aggregated from over 35 providers. One of the products we are building on top of this is something called Learning Paths, which are essentially a sequence of Online Courses designed to help learners gain mastery over a certain subject.


We have recently released a Learning Path on  Data Analysis , contributed by Claudia Gold, an early data scientist at Airbnb. We’d love it if you could look at it and tell us what you think. We are always looking for constructive feedback.
  
I clicked through and took a look.  It’s pretty cool.  I haven’t tried to assess the actual teaching materials (they’re mostly about programming, not statistics) but I like how it’s structured based on pointers to existing resources, which seems like an excellent compromise between (a) someone trying to write the material all himself or herself (which would require either limiting the sco</p><p>2 0.97316182 <a title="2345-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-The_Road_to_a_B.html">515 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-The Road to a B</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student in my intro class came by the other day with a lot of questions.  It soon became clear that he was confused about a lot of things, going back several weeks in the course.  What this means is that we did not do a good job of monitoring his performance earlier during the semester.  But the question now is:  what do do next?  I’ll sign the drop form any time during the semester, but he didn’t want to drop the class (the usual scheduling issues).  And he doesn’t want to get a C or a D.  He’s in big trouble and at this point is basically rolling the dice that he’ll do well enough on the final to eke out a B in the course.  (Yes, he goes to section meetings and office hours, and he even tried hiring a tutor.  But it’s tough–if you’ve already been going to class and still don’t know what’s going on, it’s not so easy to pull yourself out of the hole, even if you have a big pile of practice problems ahead of you.)

I’m in Psych and Center for Neural Science and I’m teaching a doctoral course this term in methods in psychophysics (never mind the details) at the tail end of which I’m planning on at least 2 lectures on Bayesian parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison. So far, all the readings I have are a bit too obscure and either glancing (bits of machine-learning books: Bishop, MacKay) or too low-level. The only useful reference I’ve got is an application of these methods (a methods article of mine in a Neuroscience Methods journal). The idea is to give them a decent idea of both estimation (Jeffries priors, marginals of the posterior over the parameters) and model comparison (cross-validation, AIC, BIC, full-blown Bayesian model posterior comparisons, Bayes factor, Occam factor, blah blah blah).


So: have you any suggestions for articles or chapters that might be suitable (yes, I’m aware you have an entire book that’s obviously relevant)?

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  from Don Taylor:
  
Can national data be used to estimate state-level results? . . . A challenge is the fact that the sample size in many states is very small . . . Richard [Gonzales] used a regression approach to extrapolate this information to provide a state-level support for health reform:

 
To get around the challenge presented by small sample sizes, the model presented here combines the benefits of incorporating auxiliary demographic information about the states with the hierarchical modeling approach commonly used in small area estimation. The model is designed to “shrink” estimates toward the average level of support in the region when there are few observations available, while simultaneously adjusting for the demographics and political ideology in the state. This approach therefore takes fuller advantage of all information available in the data to estimate state-level public opinion.

<p>Introduction: Here’s a good one if you want to tell your students about question wording bias.  It’s fun because the data are all on the web–the research is something that students could do on their own–if they know what to look for.  Another win for Google.
 
Here’s the story.  I found the following graph on the front page of the American Enterprise Institute, a well-known D.C. think tank:
 
 
 
My first thought was that they should replace this graph by a time series, which would show so much more information.  I did a web search and, indeed, looking at a broad range of poll questions over time gives us a much richer perspective on public opinion about Afghanistan than is revealed in the above graph.
 
I did a quick google search (“polling report afghanistan”) and found  this .  The quick summary is that roughly 40% of Americans favor the Afghan war (down from about 50% from 2006 through early 2009).
 
The Polling Report page also features the Quninipiac poll featured in the above graph; here it r</p><p>6 0.94605041 <a title="2345-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-30-%E2%80%9CStatistical_Modeling%3A__A_Fresh_Approach%E2%80%9D.html">1782 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-30-“Statistical Modeling:  A Fresh Approach”</a></p>

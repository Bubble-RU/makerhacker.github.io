<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>4 0.12400755 <a title="2220-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-26-Age_and_happiness%3A__The_pattern_isn%E2%80%99t_as_clear_as_you_might_think.html">486 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-26-Age and happiness:  The pattern isn’t as clear as you might think</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>5 0.1180828 <a title="2220-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-30-Retracted_articles_and_unethical_behavior_in_economics_journals%3F.html">1435 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-30-Retracted articles and unethical behavior in economics journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>6 0.11656614 <a title="2220-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Commenter Tggp  links  to a criticism of science journalist Sharon Begley by science journalist Matthew Hutson.  I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”
 
Hutson  writes :

<p>Introduction: When I spoke at Princeton last year, I talked with neuroscientist Sam Wang, who told me about a project he did surveying incoming Princeton freshmen about mental illness in their families.  He and his coauthor Benjamin Campbell found some interesting results, which they just  published :
  
A link between intellect and temperament has long been the subject of speculation. . . . Studies of the artistically inclined report linkage with familial depression, while among eminent and creative scientists, a lower incidence of affective disorders is found.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Carroll  shoots down  a politically-loaded claim about cancer survival.  Lots of useful  background  from science reporter Sharon Begley:
  
With the United States spending more on healthcare than any other country — $2.5 trillion, or just over $8,000 per capita, in 2009 — the question has long been, is it worth it? At least for spending on cancer, a controversial new study answers with an emphatic “yes.” . . .


Experts shown an advance copy of the paper by Reuters argued that the tricky statistics of cancer outcomes tripped up the authors.


“This study is pure folly,” said biostatistician Dr. Don Berry of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “It’s completely misguided and it’s dangerous. Not only are the authors’ analyses flawed but their conclusions are also wrong.”
  
Ouch.  Arguably the study shouldn’t be getting any coverage at all, but given that it’s in the news, it’s good to see it get shot down.

<p>Introduction: I received a few emails today on bloggable topics.  Rather than expanding each response into a full post, I thought I’d just handle them all quickly. 
   
 1.   Steve Roth asks what I think of  this graph :
  
 
  
I replied:  Interseting but perhaps misleading, as of course any estimate of elasticity of -20 or +5 or whatever is just crap, and so the real question is what is happening in the more reasonable range.
 
 2.   One of my General Social Studies colleagues pointed me to  this report , writing “FYI – some interesting new results, using the linked GSS-NDI data. I trust this study will raise some heated discussions.”  Another colleague wrote, “I’m rather skeptical of the result but at least they spelled GSS right.”
 
The topic is a paper, “Anti-Gay Prejudice and All-Cause Mortality Among Heterosexuals in the United States,” published by Mark Hatzenbuehler, Anna Bellatorre, and Peter Muennig.
 
My reaction:  Yes, it seems ludicrous to me.  Especially this:

<p>Introduction: X  and I heard about  this  much-publicized recent paper by Val Johnson, who suggests changing the default level of statistical significance from z=2 to z=3 (or, as he puts it, going from p=.05 to p=.005 or .001).  Val argues that you need to go out to 3 standard errors to get a Bayes factor of 25 or 50 in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  I don’t really buy this, first because Val’s model is a weird (to me) mixture of two point masses, which he creates in order to make a minimax argument, and second because I don’t see why you need a Bayes factor of 25 to 50 in order to make a claim.  I’d think that a factor of 5:1, say, provides strong information already—if you really believe those odds.  The real issue, as I see it, is that we’re getting Bayes factors and posterior probabilities we don’t believe, because we’re assuming flat priors that don’t really make sense.  This is a topic that’s come up over and over in recent months on this blog, for example in this discussion of why I  d</p><p>3 0.97262812 <a title="2220-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-11-Adding_an_error_model_to_a_deterministic_model.html">1162 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-11-Adding an error model to a deterministic model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Lakeland  asks , “Where do likelihoods come from?”  He describes a class of problems where you have a deterministic dynamic model that you want to fit to data.  The data won’t fit perfectly so, if you want to do Bayesian inference, you need to introduce an error model.  This looks a little bit different from the usual way that models are presented in statistics textbooks, where the focus is typically on the random error process, not on the deterministic part of the model.  A focus on the error process makes sense in some applications that have inherent randomness or variation (for example, genetics, psychology, and survey sampling) but not so much in the physical sciences, where the deterministic model can be complicated and is typically the essence of the study.  Often in these sorts of studies, the staring point (and sometimes the ending point) is what the physicists call “nonlinear least squares” or what we would call normally-distributed errors.  That’s what we did for our</p><p>4 0.97248936 <a title="2220-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-25-Revised_statistical_standards_for_evidence_%28comments_to_Val_Johnson%E2%80%99s_comments_on_our_comments_on_Val%E2%80%99s_comments_on_p-values%29.html">2305 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-25-Revised statistical standards for evidence (comments to Val Johnson’s comments on our comments on Val’s comments on p-values)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, a few months ago Val Johnson  published  an article, “Revised standards for statistical evidence,” making a Bayesian argument that researchers and journals should use a p=0.005 publication threshold rather than the usual p=0.05.
 
Christian Robert and I were unconvinced by Val’s reasoning and wrote a  response , “Revised evidence for statistical standards,” in which we wrote:
  
Johnson’s minimax prior is not intended to correspond to any distribution of effect sizes; rather, it represents a worst case scenario under some mathematical assumptions. Minimax and tradeoffs do well together, and it is hard for us to see how any worst case procedure can supply much guidance on how to balance between two different losses. . . .


We would argue that the appropriate significance level depends on the scenario and that what worked well for agricultural experiments in the 1920s might not be so appropriate for many applications in modern biosciences . . .</p><p>5 0.97001016 <a title="2220-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-10-The_statistical_significance_filter.html">899 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-10-The statistical significance filter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”).
 
We presented some discussion and evidence from Dan Kahan suggesting that the evidence for such a change was not so clear at all.  Kahan drew his conclusions from a more detailed analysis of the much-discussed Pew data, along with a comparison to a recent Gallup poll.

[sent-1, score-0.745]
</p><p>2 Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”). [sent-5, score-0.174]
</p><p>3 Here are the results—the numbers represent the percent saying “evolved” minus the percent saying “existed in their present form. [sent-9, score-0.126]
</p><p>4 ”         The 2009 survey is an outlier—everyone was more likely to express support for evolution than they were in the surrounding years. [sent-10, score-0.605]
</p><p>5 I [Weakliem] am not sure why the results from this survey should be so different from the others, but I noticed that it focused on science, while the others had a mix of topics. [sent-11, score-0.251]
</p><p>6 So perhaps people felt more inclined to go along with the scientific consensus after answering a lot of questions on science and technology. [sent-12, score-0.083]
</p><p>7 Another possibility is that people who didn’t have much knowledge of science or faith in science were less likely to agree to participate in a survey on science. [sent-13, score-0.506]
</p><p>8 In any case, any comparison involving the 2009 results should be taken with a grain of salt. [sent-14, score-0.183]
</p><p>9 If you omit the 2009 survey, partisan differences have become a bit wider over the whole period, not because Republicans have become less likely to believe in evolution, but because Democrats and independents have become substantially more likely to believe in it. [sent-15, score-0.719]
</p><p>10 But, as Kahan notes, only 36% of surveyed Democrats believed “that humans and other living things have evolved over time due to natural processes”—with another 22% believing in evolution that was guided by a “supreme being. [sent-16, score-0.642]
</p><p>11 I pointed out that for all we know 2009 evoluton belief was “high,” in which case prior level of belief (in creatonism) is rebounding etc. [sent-20, score-0.218]
</p><p>12 No one doubts there is partisan divide, but the idea that it could change a lot in 4 yrs, while certainly *possible,* would be pretty amazing. [sent-24, score-0.172]
</p><p>13 But in any event, now that we have all the data, we can see plainly that the only thing that happened even in Pew data was a reallocation of small # of Repubs between “divine guided evolution” (somethin akin to “intelligent design”) & “creationism. [sent-26, score-0.255]
</p><p>14 ”  There was no meaningful shift in proportion of Repubs rejecting *real* evolution (natural selection kind). [sent-27, score-0.386]
</p><p>15 In fairness, Pew baited the misunderstanding trap by failing to release the the partisan breakdown for *entire* question in its initial “report”/”press release. [sent-28, score-0.23]
</p><p>16 Very very very unlike Pew, which is the only “public opinion survey” operation that does real opinion studies rather than “issue du jour. [sent-31, score-0.281]
</p><p>17 ”  I really love Pew precisely because it isn’t in the ‘opinion polling’ business but in the ‘public opinion analysis’ business. [sent-32, score-0.112]
</p><p>18 It employs super smart researchers who understand what survey items do & don’t measure & who use that understanding to enlarge knowledge of lots of complicated things, particularly relating to public understanding of science. [sent-33, score-0.435]
</p><p>19 I would label the lines in Weakliem’s graph directly rather than with a legend, also I’d use the conventional red/blue/purple colors rather than black/red/green, and I’d label the y-axis more descriptively. [sent-36, score-0.286]
</p><p>20 I make these sort of graphing comments not to discourage or intimidate the Weakliems of the world but rather as suggestions so that the future graphs they make can be even more useful. [sent-38, score-0.117]

<p>Introduction: From the  Gallup Poll :
  
Four in 10 Americans, slightly fewer today than in years past, believe God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago.
  
They’ve been asking the question since 1982 and it’s been pretty steady at 45%, so in some sense this is good news!  (I’m saying this under the completely unsupported belief that it’s better for people to believe truths than falsehoods.)
  

 
One way to think of this is that, for the overwhelming majority of people, a personal belief in young-earth creationism (or whatever you want to call it) is costless.  Or, to put it another way, the discomfort involved in holding a belief that contradicts everything you were taught in school is greater than the discomfort involved in holding a belief that seems to contradict your religious values (keeping in mind that, even among those who report attending church seldom or never, a quarter of these people agree that “God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago”).</p><p>3 0.1322704 <a title="2167-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-29-Splitting_the_data.html">544 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-29-Splitting the data</a></p>

I’m a neuroscientist at Caltech . . . I’m using the debate on the  ESP paper , as I’m sure other labs around the world are, as an opportunity to discuss some basic statistical issues/ideas w/ my lab.


Request: Is there any chance you would be willing to share your thoughts about the difference between exploratory “data mining” studies and confirmatory studies? What I have in mind is that one could use a dataset to explore/discover novel hypotheses  and then conduct another experiment to test those hypotheses rigorously. It seems that a good combination of both approaches could be the best of both worlds, since the first would lead to novel hypothesis discovery, and the later to careful testing. . . it is a fundamental issue for neuroscience and psychology.

I know too many cases where people screwed up in a survey when they were actually trying to get the right answer, for me to trust any report of a survey that doesn’t say what they did.

<p>Introduction: Everybody knows how you can lie with statistics by manipulating numbers, making inappropriate comparisons, misleading graphs, etc.  But, as I like to remind students, the simplest way to lie with statistics is to just lie!  You see this all the time, advocates who make up numbers or present numbers with such little justification that they might as well be made up (as in  this  purported survey of the “super-rich”).
 
Here I’m not talking about the  innumeracy  of a Samantha Power or  a  David Runciman, or Michael Barone-style  confusion  or Gregg Easterbrook-style  cluelessness  or even Tucker Carlson-style  asininity .  No, I’m talking about flat-out lying by a professional who has the numbers and deliberately chooses to misrepresent them.
 
The culprit is pollster Doug Schoen, and  the catch  was made by Jay Livingston.  Schoen wrote the following based on a survey he took of Occupy Wall Street participants:

The parenting club Bounty, which distributes their packs through midwives, hospitals, and large UK supermarket and pharmacy chains, commissioned a  fun little survey for Halloween from the company  OnePoll . Theme: Mothers as tricksters – tricking men into fathering their babies. You can find a full smackdown courtesy of UK-based sex educator and University College London psychologist Petra Boynton  here .
      
(One does wonder how a parenting club with such close links to the UK National Health Service thought a survey on this topic was at all appropriate, but that’s another rant.)


So far, so awful, but what I [Wolters] thought might grab your attention was the excuse OnePoll offered for their work in their email to Petra.

<p>Introduction: Here’s a good one if you want to tell your students about question wording bias.  It’s fun because the data are all on the web–the research is something that students could do on their own–if they know what to look for.  Another win for Google.
 
Here’s the story.  I found the following graph on the front page of the American Enterprise Institute, a well-known D.C. think tank:
 
 
 
My first thought was that they should replace this graph by a time series, which would show so much more information.  I did a web search and, indeed, looking at a broad range of poll questions over time gives us a much richer perspective on public opinion about Afghanistan than is revealed in the above graph.
 
I did a quick google search (“polling report afghanistan”) and found  this .  The quick summary is that roughly 40% of Americans favor the Afghan war (down from about 50% from 2006 through early 2009).
 
The Polling Report page also features the Quninipiac poll featured in the above graph; here it r</p><p>5 0.76431936 <a title="2167-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-A_False_Consensus_about_Public_Opinion_on_Torture.html">130 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-A False Consensus about Public Opinion on Torture</a></p>

Gronke et al. write (as excerpted by Sides):
  
Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.

<p>Introduction: The other day on the sister blog we  discussed  a recent Pew Research survey that seemed to show that Republicans are becoming more partisan about evolution (or, as Paul Krugman put it, “So what happened after 2009 that might be driving Republican views? . . . Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”).
 
We presented some discussion and evidence from Dan Kahan suggesting that the evidence for such a change was not so clear at all.  Kahan drew his conclusions from a more detailed analysis of the much-discussed Pew data, along with a comparison to a recent Gallup poll.
 
Also following up on this is sociologist David Wealiem, who pulls some more data into the discussion: 
  
  
Although the Pew report mentions only the 2009 survey, the question has been asked a number of times since 2005.

<p>Introduction: From the  Gallup Poll :
  
Four in 10 Americans, slightly fewer today than in years past, believe God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago.
  
They’ve been asking the question since 1982 and it’s been pretty steady at 45%, so in some sense this is good news!  (I’m saying this under the completely unsupported belief that it’s better for people to believe truths than falsehoods.)
  

 
One way to think of this is that, for the overwhelming majority of people, a personal belief in young-earth creationism (or whatever you want to call it) is costless.  Or, to put it another way, the discomfort involved in holding a belief that contradicts everything you were taught in school is greater than the discomfort involved in holding a belief that seems to contradict your religious values (keeping in mind that, even among those who report attending church seldom or never, a quarter of these people agree that “God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago”).</p><p>3 0.95284736 <a title="2167-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Wacky_surveys_where_they_don%E2%80%99t_tell_you_the_questions_they_asked.html">385 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Wacky surveys where they don’t tell you the questions they asked</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Maria Wolters writes:
  
The parenting club Bounty, which distributes their packs through midwives, hospitals, and large UK supermarket and pharmacy chains, commissioned a  fun little survey for Halloween from the company  OnePoll . Theme: Mothers as tricksters – tricking men into fathering their babies.

(One does wonder how a parenting club with such close links to the UK National Health Service thought a survey on this topic was at all appropriate, but that’s another rant.)


So far, so awful, but what I [Wolters] thought might grab your attention was the excuse OnePoll offered for their work in their email to Petra.

<p>Introduction: People seeking unemployment benefits or welfare would have to first pass a drug test under a proposal Sen. Orrin Hatch will try to add to legislation extending the social safety net during this time of economic turmoil.  
 
Hatch … said his idea would help battle drug addiction and could reduce the nation’s debt. He will try to get the Senate to include his amendment to a $140 billion bill extending tax breaks and social programs this week.
 
“This amendment is a way to help people get off of drugs to become productive and healthy members of society, while ensuring that valuable taxpayer dollars aren’t wasted,” he said after announcing his amendment. “Too many Americans are locked into a life of a dangerous dependency not only on drugs, but the federal assistance that serves to enable their addiction.”

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.

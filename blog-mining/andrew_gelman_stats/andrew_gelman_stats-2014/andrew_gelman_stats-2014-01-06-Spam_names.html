<p>Introduction: Some asshole who has a bug up his ass about compressed sensing is spamming our  comments  with a bunch of sock puppets.  All from the same IP address:  “George Stoneriver,” Scott Wolfe,” and just plain “Paul,”  all saying pretty much the same thing in the same sort of broken English (except for Paul, whose post was too short to do a dialect analysis). “Scott Wolfe” is a generic sort of name, but a quick google search reveals nothing related to this topic. “George Stoneriver” seems to have no internet presence at all (besides the comments at this blog).  As for “Paul,” I don’t know, maybe the spammer was too lazy to invent a last name?
 
Our spammer spends about half his time slamming the field of compressed sensing and the other half pumping up the work of someone named Xiteng Liu.  There’s no excuse for this behavior.  It’s horrible, a true abuse of our scholarly community.

<p>Introduction: I received the following two emails within fifteen minutes of each other.
 
First, from “Alexa Russell,” subject line “An idea for a blog post: The Role, Importance, and Power of Words”:
  
Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best, 
Alexa

<p>Introduction: I have to go through the inbox to approve new comments.  When I set to auto-approve, I get overwhelmed with spam.  As is, I still get spam but it’s manageable.
 
Usually the spam is uninteresting but this one caught my eye:
 
   
 
At first this seemed reasonable enough:  law firm is desperate for business, spams blogs to raise its Google ranking.  But what’s with the writing in the actual comment?  It’s incoherent but it doesn’t look computer-generated.  My guess is that the law firm in Massachusetts hired a company that promised to raise their Google rankings, and that this company hired some non-English-speaking foreigners to search through the web and write some spam comments.  If anyone actually reads the comments, they might get the impression that this law firm is staffed by illiterates . . . but, as we all know, nobody reads blog comments!

<p>Introduction: There was this thing going around awhile ago, the “porn star name,” which you create by taking the name of your childhood pet, followed by the name of the street where you grew up (for example, Blitz Clifton).
 
But recently I’ve been thinking about spam names.  Just in the last two days, I’ve received emails from “Blair Williams” (“I’m sorry to have to tell you this. Tomorrow is the last day that the 40% discount will be available.”), “Audrey Woods” (“I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we just launched an infographic . . .”), “Steven Harris” (“Part-Time Job – Earn $600/day in your spare-time”), and “Nick Bagnall” (“I sent you an email some weeks ago concerning . . .”).  Actually, I think “Nick Bagnall” is probably a real person who’s just spamming me.  But the first three names above look fake fake fake.  And then there were “George Stoneriver,” Scott Wolfe,” and just plain “Paul,” who were sockpuppeting our discussion on compressed sensing a couple months ago.

Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching OpenDataLatinoamerica.org, a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.


We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain. Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight International Journalism Fellows.


If you work in Latin America or Central America your organization can take part in OpenDataLatinoamerica.org.

<p>Introduction: My econ dept colleague Joseph Stiglitz  suggests  that financial fraudsters be sent to prison.  He points out that the usual penalty–million-dollar fines–just isn’t enough for crimes whose rewards can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
That all makes sense, but why do the options have to be:
 
1.  No punishment
 
2.  A fine with little punishment or deterrent value
 
3.  Prison. 
 
What’s the point of putting nonviolent criminals in prison?  As I’ve said  before , I’d prefer if the government just took all these convicted thieves’ assets along with 95% of their salary for several years, made them do community service (sorting bottles and cans at the local dump, perhaps; a financier should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc. If restriction of personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, they could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if you are ever more than 3 miles from your home.

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

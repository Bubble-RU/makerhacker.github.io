</p><p>6 Thus, my unfamiliarity or discomfort with Pearl’s causal diagrams does not represent an anti-endorsement but rather just an open statement about my own experiences. [sent-15, score-0.322]
</p><p>7 (I do have disagreements with some explicators of Pearl, for example I think Steven Sloman made fundamental misconceptions in his book that I  reviewed  a few years ago, but that’s another story. [sent-16, score-0.14]
</p><p>8 I can’t fault a method because it can lead to errors if used without full understanding, any more than I would slam Bayesian inference in general just because it can give bad results when people inappropriately  assume  flat priors. [sent-17, score-0.232]
</p><p>9 )   In any case, though, I resonate with Pearl’s general point that making strong assumptions can be good:  strong assumptions give many handles for model checking (see chapter 6 of BDA) and ultimately for model improvement. [sent-18, score-0.795]
</p><p>10 At the conclusion of his post, Pearl comments on the difficulties of working with the categories from Rubin’s 1976 paper on inference and missing data, with the three categories being Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR). [sent-21, score-0.55]
</p><p>11 Many years ago I asked Rubin about this point, that these particular definitions seem like an odd way to divide the world into three parts. [sent-23, score-0.206]
</p><p>12 Rubin’s reply, when I asked him this, was that he used this awkward partition with these awkward names to be consistent with the existing statistical literature. [sent-26, score-0.522]
</p><p>13 What was happening was that researchers were  already  using “missing at random” and similar terms but in a sloppy way, without any mathematical definition or clear statistical justification. [sent-27, score-0.148]
</p><p>14 So his 1976 paper was, to a large extent, an effort at rationalizing existing terms and practices, taking what people were already doing and uncovering the implicit models underlying these methods. [sent-28, score-0.655]
</p><p>15 )   So, although Pearl seems to think of work based on Rubin’s 1976 paper as somewhat unscientific, I think he should consider the history behind this:  Rubin’s definitions clarify the assumptions underlying the methods that people were already happy to use. [sent-32, score-0.652]
</p><p>16 I think this sort of activity—taking a proposed or existing method and considering what underlying model it corresponds to—to be an excellent thing to do, and very much in the Bayesian tradition. [sent-33, score-0.402]
</p><p>17 Here are two early examples of my own such efforts, from  1990  on a paper by Silverman et al. [sent-34, score-0.178]
</p><p>18 In both cases I don’t think the authors of the original papers really saw the point of my Bayesian reinterpretations, but I found it very helpful to take a method and consider what it meant as a model. [sent-36, score-0.172]

I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me:

<p>Introduction: In  an article  published in 2001, Pearl wrote:
  
I [Pearl] turned Bayesian in 1971, as soon as I began reading Savage’s monograph The Foundations of Statistical Inference [Savage, 1962]. The arguments were unassailable: (i) It is plain silly to ignore what we know, (ii) It is natural and useful to cast what we know in the language of probabilities, and (iii) If our subjective probabilities are erroneous, their impact will get washed out in due time, as the number of observations increases.


Thirty years later, I [Pearl] am still a devout Bayesian in the sense of (i), but I now doubt the wisdom of (ii) and I know that, in general, (iii) is false.
  
He elaborates:
  
The bulk of human knowledge is organized around causal, not probabilistic relationships, and the grammar of probability calculus is insufficient for capturing those relationships. Specifically, the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as “mud does not cause rain” and “symptom</p><p>5 0.18753982 <a title="2170-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-23-Fight%21__%28also_a_bit_of_reminiscence_at_the_end%29.html">1136 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-23-Fight!

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.

I [Pearl] turned Bayesian in 1971, as soon as I began reading Savage’s monograph The Foundations of Statistical Inference [Savage, 1962]. The arguments were unassailable: (i) It is plain silly to ignore what we know, (ii) It is natural and useful to cast what we know in the language of probabilities, and (iii) If our subjective probabilities are erroneous, their impact will get washed out in due time, as the number of observations increases.


Thirty years later, I [Pearl] am still a devout Bayesian in the sense of (i), but I now doubt the wisdom of (ii) and I know that, in general, (iii) is false.
  
He elaborates:
  
The bulk of human knowledge is organized around causal, not probabilistic relationships, and the grammar of probability calculus is insufficient for capturing those relationships.

<p>Introduction: Under the heading, “Bad graph candidate,” Kevin Wright points to  this article  [link fixed], writing:
  
Some of the figures use the same line type for two different series.


More egregious are the confidence intervals that are constant width instead of increasing in width into the future.
  
Indeed.  What’s even more embarrassing is that these graphs appeared in an article in the magazine Significance, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society.  
 
Perhaps every scientific journal could have a graphics editor whose job is to point out really horrible problems and require authors to make improvements.
 
The difficulty, as always, is that scientists write these articles for free and as a public service (publishing in Significance doesn’t pay, nor does it count as a publication in an academic record), so it might be difficult to get authors to fix their graphs.  On the other hand, if an article is worth writing at all, it’s worth trying to conv</p><p>2 0.98073852 <a title="2170-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-09-A_tale_of_two_discussion_papers.html">1848 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-09-A tale of two discussion papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I’ve written a dozen or so journal articles that have appeared with discussions, and I’ve participated in many published discussions of others’ articles as well.  I get a lot out of these article-discussion-rejoinder packages, in all three of my roles as reader, writer, and discussant.
 
 Part 1:  The story of an unsuccessful discussion 
 
The first time I had a discussion article was the result of an unfortunate circumstance.  I had a research idea that resulted in an  article  with Don Rubin on monitoring the mixing of Markov chain simulations. I new the idea was great, but back then we worked pretty slowly so it was awhile before we had a final version to submit to a journal.  (In retrospect I wish I’d just submitted the  draft version  as it was.)  In the meantime I presented the paper at a conference.  Our idea was very well received (I had a sheet of paper so people could write their names and addresses to get preprints, and we got either 50 or 150 (I can’t remembe</p><p>3 0.98039061 <a title="2170-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-The_importance_of_style_in_academic_writing.html">902 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-The importance of style in academic writing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my comments on  academic cheating , I briefly discussed the question of how some of these papers could’ve been published in the first place, given that they tend to be of low quality.  (It’s rare that people plagiarize the good stuff, and, when they do—for example when a senior scholar takes credit for a junior researcher’s contributions without giving proper credit—there’s not always a paper trail, and there can be legitimate differences of opinion about the relative contributions of the participants.)
 
Anyway, to get back to the cases at hand:  how did these rulebreakers get published in the first place?  The question here is not how did they get away with cheating but how is it that top journals were publishing mediocre research? 
   
In the case of the profs who falsified data (Diederik Stapel) or did not follow scientific protocol (Mark Hauser), the answer is clear:  By cheating, they were able to get the sort of too-good-to-be-true results which, if they  were  true, would be</p><p>4 0.97872198 <a title="2170-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-30-Retracted_articles_and_unethical_behavior_in_economics_journals%3F.html">1435 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-30-Retracted articles and unethical behavior in economics journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>5 0.97812027 <a title="2170-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

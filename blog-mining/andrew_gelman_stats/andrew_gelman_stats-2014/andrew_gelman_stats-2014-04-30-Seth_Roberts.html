He sometimes came to the statistics department seminar and we got to talking about various things; in particular we shared an interest in statistical graphics.  Much of my work in this direction eventually went toward the use of graphical displays to understand fitted models.

We continued to discuss these issues over the years;  see here , for example.
 
At some point when we were at Berkeley the administration was encouraging the faculty to teach freshman seminars, and I had the idea of teaching a course on left-handedness.  I’d just read the book by Stanley Coren and thought it would be fun to go through it with a class, chapter by chapter.  But my knowledge of psych</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 But my knowledge of psychology was minimal so I contacted the one person I knew in the psychology department and asked him if he had any suggestions of someone who’d like to teach the course with me. [sent-8, score-0.226]
</p><p>2 One of his ideas was to look at large faces in the morning (he used tapes of late-night comedy monologues). [sent-11, score-0.144]
</p><p>3 He told me once that his shift was motivated by teaching introductory undergraduate psychology:  the students, he said, were interested in things that would affect their lives, and, compared to that, the kind of research that leads to a productive academic career did not seem so appealing. [sent-22, score-0.22]
</p><p>4 I suppose that Seth could’ve tried to do research in clinical psychology (Berkeley’s department actually has a strong clinical program) but instead he moved in a different direction and tried different things to improve his sleep and then, later, his skin, his mood, and his diet. [sent-23, score-0.322]
</p><p>5 In this work, Seth applied what he later called his “insider/outsider perspective”:  he was an insider in that he applied what he’d learned from years of research on animal behavior, an outsider in that he was not working within the existing paradigm of research in physiology and nutrition. [sent-24, score-0.179]
</p><p>6 At the same time he was working on a book project, which I believe started as a new introductory psychology course focused on science and self-improvement but ultimately morphed into a trade book on ways in which our adaptations to Stone Age life were not serving us well in the modern era. [sent-25, score-0.214]
</p><p>7 When Seth came up with the connection between morning faces and depression, this seemed potentially hugely important. [sent-28, score-0.144]
</p><p>8 Seth’s next success was losing 40 pounds on his unusual diet, in which you can eat whatever you want as long as each day you drink a cup of unflavored sugar water, at least an hour before or after a meal. [sent-34, score-0.335]
</p><p>9 To be more precise, it’s not that you can eat whatever you want—obviously, if you live a sedentary lifestyle and you eat a bunch of big macs and an extra-large coke each day, you’ll get fat. [sent-35, score-0.14]
</p><p>10 I asked Seth once if he thought I’d lose weight if I were to try his diet in a passive way, drinking the sugar water at the recommended time but not actively trying to reduce my caloric intake. [sent-37, score-0.426]
</p><p>11 He said he supposed not, that the diet would make it easier to lose weight but you’d probably still have to consciously eat less. [sent-38, score-0.317]
</p><p>12 Some of his findings from the ten of his experiments discussed in the article:    Seeing faces in the morning on television decreased mood in the evening and improved mood the next day . [sent-49, score-0.315]
</p><p>13 Standing 8 hours per day reduced early awakening and made sleep more restorative . [sent-52, score-0.212]
</p><p>14 Drinking unflavored fructose water caused a large weight loss that has lasted more than 1 year . [sent-55, score-0.194]
</p><p>15 Seth’s work was featured in a series of increasingly prominent blogs, which led to a newspaper article by the authors of Freakonomics and ultimately a successful diet book (not enough to make Seth rich, I think, but Seth had simple tastes and no desire to be rich, as far as I know). [sent-62, score-0.172]
</p><p>16 Meanwhile, Seth started a blog of his own which led to a message board for his diet that he told me had thousands of participants. [sent-63, score-0.18]
</p><p>17 On his blog and elsewhere Seth reported success with various self-experiments,  most recently  a claim of improved brain function after eating half a stick of butter a day. [sent-64, score-0.186]
</p><p>18 It took Seth close to 10 years of sustained experimentation to fix his sleep problems, but in recent years it seemed that all sorts of different things he tried were effective. [sent-66, score-0.265]
</p><p>19 One problem is that sleep hours and weight can be measured fairly objectively, whereas if you measure brain function by giving yourself little quizzes, it doesn’t seem hard at all for a bit of unconscious bias to drive all your results. [sent-69, score-0.244]
</p><p>20 Seth was a complete outsider in the psychology department at Berkeley for decades and eventually took early retirement while barely in his fifties. [sent-76, score-0.226]

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: Seth sent along an article (not by him) from the psychology literature and wrote:
  
This is a good example of your complaint about statistical significance. The authors want to say that predictability of information determines how distracting something is and have two conditions that vary in predictability. One is significantly distracting, the other isn’t. But the two conditions are not significantly different from each other. So the two conditions are different more weakly than p = 0.05.


I don’t think the reviewers failed to notice this. They just thought it should be published anyway, is my guess.


To me, the interesting question is: where should the bar be? at p = 0.05? at p = 0.10? something else? How can we figure out where to put the bar?
  
I replied:
 
My quick answer is that we have to get away from .05 and .10 and move to something that takes into account prior information.  This could be Bayesian (of course) or could be done classically using power calculations, as disc</p><p>4 0.36158988 <a title="2313-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-15-What_people_do_vs._what_they_want_to_do.html">88 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-15-What people do vs. what they want to do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seth, a retired university professor who, during his employment at an elite school, spent a lot of time doing research with the goal of improving people’s lives,  writes :
  
Professors, especially at elite schools, dislike doing research with obvious value. It strikes them as menial. “Practical” and “applied” are terms of disparagement, whereas “pure” research (research without obvious value) is good.
  
Given that Seth isn’t that way himself, I assume he’d say that this claim applies to “many” professors or “most” professors but surely not all?
 
What I’ve noticed, though, is more the opposite, that even people who do extremely theoretical work like to feel that it is applied, practical, and useful.  I think that, among other things, Seth is confusing what people  want to do  with what they actually  can do .  For example, he criticizes biologists for researching stem cells and prions rather than prevention of disease.  But preventing diseases is difficult!  That’s why the scientists</p><p>5 0.25773898 <a title="2313-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-26-Tough_love_as_a_style_of_writing.html">111 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-26-Tough love as a style of writing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to an interview with Seth Godin, who makes some commonplace but useful observations on jobs and careers.  It’s fine, but whenever I read this sort of thing, I get annoyed by the super-aggressive writing style.  These internet guys–Seth Godin, Clay Shirky, Philip Greenspun, Jeff Jarvis, and so on–are always getting in your face, telling you how everything you thought was true was wrong.  Some of the things these guys say are just silly (for example, Godin’s  implication  that Bob Dylan is more of a success than the Monkees because Dylan sells more tickets), other times they have interesting insights, but reading any of them for awhile just sets me on edge.  I can’t take being shouted at, and I get a little tired of hearing over and over again that various people, industries, etc., are dinosaurs.
 
Where does this aggressive style come from?  My guess is that it’s coming from the vast supply of “business books” out there.

I just read your  review  of Gertnerâ&euro;&trade;s book.  I agree with most of what you say re Bell labs.


I worked in the research area from 1964 to 1992 having arrived in what I regarded as a sort of heaven after 10 years in industrial research elsewhere. For much of that time I headed the Materials Science Research Dept. in the Solid State Electronics Laboratory. For a large number of the senior staff the eight hour day was the exception, not the rule, and even on weekends the parking lot was often 1/4 full. Most of the people I worked with were self driven and loved their work and the opportunities the Labs. provided to be maximally scientifically productive. Even during lunch in the cafeteria productive interactions were a common occurrence. I could go on and on, but just wanted to thank you for bring back pleasant memories of a long and productive career at Bell Labs after 20 years in retirement.

<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.  The input is the heat from solar radiation (easy enough to compute given the trajectory).

<p>Introduction: A group of University of California professors headed by physicist Richard Muller recently released a  report  confirming global warming.  Then geophysicist Judith Curry, a coauthor on the papers produced by the Muller group, turned around and  said  that their data actually show that global warming has stopped.  (Also see clarification  here .)
 
Curry is described in the news article as the second author on the papers, but the authors are listed alphabetically so it’s probably more accurate to describe her as one of the ten authors.  Muller’s one, Curry’s another, . . . now I want to know what 7 of the other 8 authors think!

<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>6 0.80079257 <a title="2313-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-15-What_people_do_vs._what_they_want_to_do.html">88 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-15-What people do vs. what they want to do</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>2 0.97924799 <a title="2313-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-08-I_Am_Too_Absolutely_Heteroskedastic_for_This_Probit_Model.html">1047 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-08-I Am Too Absolutely Heteroskedastic for This Probit Model</a></p>

I’m working on a project that uses a binary choice model on panel data. Since I have panel data and am using MLE, I’m concerned about heteroskedasticity making my estimates inconsistent and biased. 


Are you familiar with any statistical packages with pre-built tests for heteroskedasticity in binary choice ML models? If not, is there value in cutting my data into groups over which I guess the error variance might vary and eyeballing residual plots? Have you other suggestions about how I might resolve this concern?
  
I replied that I wouldn’t worry so much about heteroskedasticity.  Breaking up the data into pieces might make sense, but for the purpose of estimating how the coefficients might vary—that is, nonlinearity and interactions.
 
Soren shot back:
  
I’m somewhat puzzled however: homoskedasticity is an identifying assumption in estimating a probit model: if we don’t have it all sorts of bad things can happen to our parameter estimates.

<p>Introduction: Reihan Salam  discusses  a theory of Tyler Cowen regarding “threshold earners,” a sort of upscale version of a slacker.   Here’s Cowen :
  
A threshold earner is someone who seeks to earn a certain amount of money and no more. If wages go up, that person will respond by seeking less work or by working less hard or less often. That person simply wants to “get by” in terms of absolute earning power in order to experience other gains in the form of leisure.
  
Salam continues:
  
This clearly reflects the pattern of wage dispersion among my friends, particularly those who attended elite secondary schools and colleges and universities. I [Salam] know many “threshold earners,” including both high and low earners who could earn much more if they chose to make the necessary sacrifices. But they are satisficers.
  
OK, fine so far.  But then the claim is made that “threshold earning” behavior increases income inequality.  In Cowen’s words:

<p>Introduction: I’m sorry I don’t have any new zombie papers in time for Halloween.  Instead I’d like to be a little monster by reproducing a mini-rant from  this article  on experimental reasoning in social science:
  
I will restrict my discussion to social science examples. Social scientists are often tempted to illustrate their ideas with examples from medical research. When it comes to medicine, though, we are, with rare exceptions, at best ignorant laypersons (in my case, not even reaching that level), and it is my impression that by reaching for medical analogies we are implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes. Evidence-based medicine is the subject of a large literature of its own (see, for example, Lau, Ioannidis, and Schmid, 1998).</p><p>5 0.97454178 <a title="2313-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-13-You_heard_it_here_first%3A_Intense_exercise_can_suppress_appetite.html">2022 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-13-You heard it here first: Intense exercise can suppress appetite</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
The New York Times recently ran an article entitled  “How Exercise Can Help Us Eat Less,”  which begins with this: “Strenuous exercise seems to dull the urge to eat afterward better than gentler workouts, several new studies show, adding to a growing body of science suggesting that intense exercise may have unique benefits.” The article is based on a couple of recent studies in which moderately overweight volunteers participated in different types of exercise, and had their food intake monitored at a subsequent meal.
 
The article also says “[The volunteers] also displayed significantly lower levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is known to stimulate appetite, and elevated levels of both blood lactate and blood sugar, which have been shown to lessen the drive to eat, after the most vigorous interval session than after the other workouts. And the appetite-suppressing effect of the highly intense intervals lingered into the next day, according to food diarie</p><p>same-blog 6 0.97077811 <a title="2313-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-30-Seth_Roberts.html">2313 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-30-Seth Roberts</a></p>

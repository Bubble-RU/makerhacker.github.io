 The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds 


My favorite statistics demonstration is the one with the bag of candies. I’ve elaborated upon it since including it in  the Teaching Statistics book  and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.


 Preparation 


Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it’s exactly 100.


You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.


Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>6 0.081021987 <a title="2257-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-17-On_deck_this_week%3A__Revisitings.html">2253 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-17-On deck this week:  Revisitings</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.  That ain’t right.  Let the student hold the pen.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: From 2008:
  
 The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds 


My favorite statistics demonstration is the one with the bag of candies. I’ve elaborated upon it since including it in  the Teaching Statistics book  and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.


 Preparation 


Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it’s exactly 100.


You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.


Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.


 Setup

<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .  But I wonder how the profs in the psych d</p><p>3 0.94456065 <a title="2257-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-16-%E2%80%9CGroundbreaking_or_Definitive%3F_Journals_Need_to_Pick_One%E2%80%9D.html">1122 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-16-“Groundbreaking or Definitive? Journals Need to Pick One”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  writes :
  
As long as a journal pursues a strategy of publishing “wow” studies, it will inevitably contain more unreplicable findings and unsupportable conclusions than equally rigorous but more “boring” journals. Groundbreaking will always be higher-risk. And definitive will be the territory of journals that publish meta-analyses and reviews. . . .


Most conclusions, even those in peer-reviewed papers in rigorous journals, should be regarded as tentative at best; but press releases and other public communication rarely convey that. . . .
  
His message to all of us:
  
Our standard response to a paper in Science, Nature, or Psychological Science should be “wow, that’ll be really interesting if it replicates.” And in our teaching and our engagement with the press and public, we need to make clear why that is the most enthusiastic response we can justify.</p><p>4 0.9442988 <a title="2257-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-10-Hey%2C_where%E2%80%99s_my_kickback%3F.html">78 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-10-Hey, where’s my kickback?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I keep hearing about textbook publishers who practically bribe instructors to assign their textbooks to students.  And then I received this (unsolicited) email:
  
 
You have recently been sent Pearson (Allyn & Bacon, Longman, Prentice Hall) texts to review for your summer and fall courses.  As a thank you for reviewing our texts, I would like to invite you to participate in a brief survey (attached).


If you have any questions about the survey, are not sure which books you have been sent, or if you would like to receive instructor’s materials, desk copies, etc. please let me know!  If you have recently received your course assignments – let me know as well .


Additionally, if you have decided to use a Pearson book in your summer or fall courses, I will provide you with an ISBN that will include discounts and resources for your students at no extra cost!


All you have to do is answer the 3 simple questions on the attached survey and you will receive a $10.00 Dunkin Donuts gift card.</p><p>5 0.93483353 <a title="2257-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Alfred_Kahn.html">487 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Alfred Kahn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Appointed “inflation czar” in late 1970s, Alfred Kahn is  most famous  for deregulating the airline industry.  At the time this seemed to make sense, although in retrospect I’m less a fan of consumer-driven policies than I used to be.  When I was a kid we subscribed to Consumer Reports and so I just assumed that everything that was good for the consumer–lower prices, better products, etc.–was a good thing.  Upon reflection, though, I think it’s a mistake to focus too narrowly on the interests of consumers.  For example (from  my Taleb review  a couple years ago):
  
The discussion on page 112 of how Ralph Nader saved lives (mostly via seat belts in cars) reminds me of his car-bumper campaign in the 1970s. My dad subscribed to Consumer Reports then (he still does, actually, and I think reads it for pleasure–it must be one of those Depression-mentality things), and at one point they were pushing heavily for the 5-mph bumpers.

<p>Introduction: This blog has roughly a month’s worth of items waiting to be posted.  I post about once a day, sometimes rescheduling posts to make room for something topical.
 
Anyway, it struck me that I know what’s coming up, but  you  don’t.  So, here’s what we have for you during the next few days:
 
 Mon:   More on US health care overkill
 
 Tues:   My talks in Bristol this Wed and London this Thurs
 
 Wed:   How to think about “identifiability” in Bayesian inference?
 
 Thurs:   Stopping rules and Bayesian analysis
 
 Fri:   The popularity of certain baby names is falling off the clifffffffffffff
 
Plus anything our cobloggers might choose to post during these days.  And, if Woody Allen or Ed Wegman or anyone else newsworthy asks us to publish an op-ed for them, we’ll consider it.
 
Enjoy.</p><p>6 0.80307972 <a title="2265-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-26-On_deck_this_week.html">2348 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-26-On deck this week</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, I’ve given up on  theme weeks .  I have enough saved-up material to do it, and it wouldn’t be too much trouble to group the scheduled posts into themes, but there doesn’t really seem to be a point.  I say this because, having looked at the comment threads from the past few weeks, the comments seem pretty much tied to individual posts in any case.  So I think I’ll go back to the old system where each post stands alone.
 
Just for fun I thought I’d run a week’s worth of old posts, just some things I came across when searching for various things.  Of course I could just post the links right here but instead I’ll repost with my comments on how things have changed in the intervening years.
 
 Mon :  Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models
 
 Tues :  A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice
 
 Wed :  What property is important in a risk prediction model? Discrimination or calibration?
 
 Thurs :  Beyond the Valley of the Trolls

<p>Introduction: I think youall are probably getting sick of this by now so I’ll put it all below the fold.
  

 
Akinola Modupe and Katherine Milkman responded to  my email  about  their study :
  
We want to clarify the reason we believe that the use of deception and a lack of informed consent were appropriate and ethical for this research study. In this project, we were studying how the timing of a decision affects discrimination based on race and/or gender.  The emails all participants in our study received were identical except for a) the sender’s name (we used 20 names that pretesting revealed were strongly associated with being either Caucasian, Black, Indian, Chinese or Hispanic, as well as associated with being male or female) and b) whether the meeting requested was for today or for a week from today.  Recipients were randomly selected and were randomly assigned to one of the race/gender/timing conditions.  This study design will allow us to test for baseline levels of discrimination in acade</p><p>3 0.9667871 <a title="2265-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-06-Your_conclusion_is_only_as_good_as_your_data.html">1369 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-06-Your conclusion is only as good as your data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  points  to an excellent rant from Peter Moskos, trashing a study about “food deserts” (which I kept reading as “food desserts”) in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Here’s Moskos:
  
From the Times:

 
There is no relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents. 


Within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood, “you can get basically any type of food,” said Roland Sturm of the RAND Corporation, lead author of one of the studies. “Maybe we should call it a food swamp rather than a desert,” he said.
 

Sure thing, Sturm. But I suspect you wouldn’t think certain neighborhoods are swamped with good food if you actually got out of your office and went to one of the neighborhoods. After all, what are going to believe: A nice data set or your lying eyes?


“Food outlet data … are classifıed using the North American Industry Classifıcation System (NAICS)” (p. 130). Assuming validity and reliability of NAICS</p><p>4 0.96472615 <a title="2265-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Alper writes:
  
Unless I missed it, you haven’t commented on the recent  article  of Michael Bang Peterson [with Daniel Sznycer, Aaron Sell, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby].  It seems to have been reviewed extensively in the lay press.  A typical example is  here .  This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”


Further, “Despite the fact that the United States, Denmark and Argentina have very different welfare systems, we still see that — at the psychol</p><p>5 0.96412122 <a title="2265-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Fun_fight_over_the_Grover_search_algorithm.html">1120 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Fun fight over the Grover search algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points me to  this  blog entry by Robert Tucci, diplomatically titled “Unethical or Really Dumb (or both) Scientists from University of Adelaide ‘Rediscover’ My Version of Grover’s Algorithm”: 
  
  
The Chappell et al. paper has 24 references but does not refer to my paper, even though their paper and mine are eerily similar. Compare them yourself. With the excellent Google and ArXiv search engines, I [Tucci] would say there is zero probability that none of its five authors knew about my paper before they wrote theirs.
  
Chappell  responds  in the comments:
  
Your paper is timestamped 2010; however the results of our paper was initially presented at the Cairns CQIQC conference in July 2008. . . . The intention of our paper is not a research article. It is a tutorial paper. . . . We had not seen your paper before. Our paper is based on the standard Grover search, not a fixed point search.

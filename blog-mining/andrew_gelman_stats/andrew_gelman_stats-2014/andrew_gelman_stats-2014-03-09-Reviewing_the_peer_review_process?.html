Dear Colleague,


Recently we informed you about SciRev, our new website where researchers can share their experiences with the peer review process and select an efficient journal for submitting their work. 


Since our start, we already received over 500 reviews and many positive reactions, which reveal a great need for comparable information on duration and quality of the review process. All reviews are publicly available on our website, both at the pages of the journals and in an overview at www.scirev.sc/reviews


To make this venture a success, many reviews are needed. We therefore would appreciate it very much if you could take a few minutes to visit our website www.SciRev.sc and share your recent review experiences with your colleagues.


SciRev also offers you the possibility to create a free account where you can administer your manuscripts under review and create a personal journal list.


Thanks on behalf of the research community,

<p>Introduction: Nick Cox  comments :
  
I heard of a leading U.S. statistician who delegates some of his book reviews to smart graduate students. The (very grateful) ex-student who told me said, in effect, it’s just his way of working. He makes the deal evident beforehand and makes it up to you in other ways by superb mentoring.
  
I don’t understand this at all!  If the student wrote the review, he or she should be sole author, no?  The thing that puzzles me about this story is that if you’re a “leading statistician,” you don’t really get any credit for reviewing.  If anything, people probably think you’re writing reviews as a way to avoid doing real work.  If there’s some concern that the journal won’t publish a review under the sole authorship of obscure student X, they could always compromise and include the senior prof as a second author on the review (in which case the prof should at least  read  the review and vet it, but that can’t take much time).

Dear  Andrew Gelman


You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years. Currently, content on the Journal is closed access for the first 2 years after publication, and then freely accessible thereafter.  On June 1, 2013, the Journal will be extending its closed-access window from 2 years to 10 years. Extending this window will close public access to your article via the Journal web portal, but public access will still be available via the National Institutes of Health PubMedCentral web portal. 


If you would like to make your article available to the public for free on the Journal web portal, we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate of  $1,000 per article. If interested in purchasing this access, please contact Brian Selzer, Publications Editor, at brian.selzer@apha.org


Additionally, you may purchas</p><p>4 0.76824296 <a title="2239-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-02-They_want_me_to_send_them_free_material_and_pay_for_the_privilege.html">1922 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-02-They want me to send them free material and pay for the privilege</a></p>

Dear Prof Gelman,


In collaboration with Frontiers in Psychology, we are organizing a Research Topic titled “Causal discovery and generalization”, hosted by Mimi Liljeholm and Marc Buehner.  As host editor, I would like to encourage you to contribute to this topic.


A brief description of the topic is provided on our homepage on the Frontiers website (section “Frontiers in Cognition”).  This is also where all articles will appear after peer-review and where participants in the topic will be able to hold relevant discussions: http://www.frontiersin.org/Cognition/researchtopics/Causal_discovery_and_generaliz/1906

<p>Introduction: I get about 10 requests to referee journal articles  each week .  At this point, even the saying No part is getting tiring.  I think I’d much prefer  Kriegeskorte’s system  of post-publication review where whatever you write about a paper is open and available to all to read, and where you can devote your review efforts to papers worth reviewing (either because of their inherent quality or importance, or because they’ve been hyped and need to be corrected).</p><p>6 0.70222884 <a title="2239-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-27-More_spam%21.html">1872 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-27-More spam!</a></p>

Dear Colleague,


Recently we informed you about SciRev, our new website where researchers can share their experiences with the peer review process and select an efficient journal for submitting their work. 


Since our start, we already received over 500 reviews and many positive reactions, which reveal a great need for comparable information on duration and quality of the review process. All reviews are publicly available on our website, both at the pages of the journals and in an overview at www.scirev.sc/reviews


To make this venture a success, many reviews are needed. We therefore would appreciate it very much if you could take a few minutes to visit our website www.SciRev.sc and share your recent review experiences with your colleagues.


SciRev also offers you the possibility to create a free account where you can administer your manuscripts under review and create a personal journal list.


Thanks on behalf of the research community, 
Jan</p><p>2 0.94314277 <a title="2239-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-08-The_Case_for_More_False_Positives_in_Anti-doping_Testing.html">1612 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-08-The Case for More False Positives in Anti-doping Testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung was  ahead of the curve  on Lance Armstrong:
  
The media has gotten the statistics totally backwards.


On the one hand, they faithfully report the colorful stories of athletes who fail drug tests pleading their innocence. (I have written about the Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador here.) On the other hand, they unquestioningly report athletes who claim “hundreds of negative tests” prove their honesty. Putting these two together implies that the media believes that negative test results are highly reliable while positive test results are unreliable.


The reality is just the opposite. When an athlete tests positive, it’s almost sure that he/she has doped. Sure, most of the clean athletes will test negative but what is often missed is that the majority of dopers will also test negative.


We don’t need to do any computation to see that this is true. In most major sports competitions, the  proportion of tests declared positive is typically below 1%.

<p>Introduction: From 2010 :
  
Greg Mankiw  writes  (link from  Tyler Cowen ):

 
Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000. I would have twice the incentive to keep working.
 

 First, the good news 


Obama’s tax rates are much lower than Mankiw had anticipated!  According to the above quote, his marginal tax rate is currently 80% but threatens to rise to 90%.


But, in October 2008, Mankiw  calculated  that Obama’s</p><p>4 0.9318617 <a title="2239-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-12-Update_on_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_work_incentives.html">338 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-12-Update on Mankiw’s work incentives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to a  blog  by Greg Mankiw with further details on his argument that his anticipated 90% marginal tax rate will reduce his work level.
 
Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.
 
2.  Neither Cowen nor Mankiw address</p><p>5 0.93094873 <a title="2239-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-01-Colorless_green_facts_asserted_resolutely.html">1292 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-01-Colorless green facts asserted resolutely</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll [yes, I've learned how to smoothly do this using alt-o] gives  some writing advice :
  
What gives a text presence is our commitment to asserting facts. We have to face the possibility that we may be wrong about them resolutely, and we do this by writing about them as though we are right.
  
This and an earlier  remark  by Basbøll are closely related in my mind to predictive model checking and to  Bayesian statistics :  we make strong assumptions and then engage the data and the assumptions in a dialogue:  assumptions + data -> inference, and we can then compare the inference to the data which can reveal problems with our model (or problems with the data, but that’s really problems with the model too, in this case problems with the model for the data).
 
I like the idea that a condition for a story to be useful is that we put some belief into it.  (One doesn’t put belief into a joke.)  And also the converse, that thnking hard about a story and believing it can be the pre</p><p>6 0.93078691 <a title="2239-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-SeeThroughNY.html">140 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-SeeThroughNY</a></p>

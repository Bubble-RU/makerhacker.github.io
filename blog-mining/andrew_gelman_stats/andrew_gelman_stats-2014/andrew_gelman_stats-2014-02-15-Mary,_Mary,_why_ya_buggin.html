Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.

<p>Introduction: I was trying to make some new graphs using 5-year-old R code and I got all these problems because I was reading in files with variable names such as “co.fipsid” and now R is automatically changing them to “co_fipsid”.  Or maybe the names had underbars all along, and the old R had changed them into dots.  Whatever.  I understand that backward compatibility can be hard to maintain, but this is just annoying.</p><p>5 0.21520738 <a title="2212-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-20-Don%E2%80%99t_douthat%2C_man%21__Please_give_this_fallacy_a_name..html">2141 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-20-Don’t douthat, man!

<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog will know that I’m always on the lookout for new items for the  lexicon .  It’s been a good month on that front.  In addition to the Garden of Forking Paths, I’ve encountered two entirely new (to me) fallacies.
 
The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!
 
Here’s the story.  The other day on the sister blog I  reported  on a pair of studies involving children and political orientation:  Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely</p><p>6 0.15258291 <a title="2212-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-03-One-way_street_fallacy_again%21_in_reporting_of_research_on_brothers_and_sisters.html">2196 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-03-One-way street fallacy again! in reporting of research on brothers and sisters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: In our Cliff  thread  from yesterday, sociologist Philip Cohen pointed to  his discussions  in the decline in the popularity of the name Mary.
 
One thing that came up was the traditional trendiness of girls’ names.  So I thought I’d share my thoughts from a couple of years ago, as  reported  by David Leonhardt:
  
Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia and an amateur name-ologist, argues that many parents want their boys to seem mature and so pick classic names. William, David, Joseph and James, all longtime stalwarts, remain in the Top 20.


With girls, Gelman says, parents are attracted to names that convey youth even into adulthood and choose names that seem to be on the upswing. By the 1990s, of course, not many girls from the 1880s were still around, and that era’s names could seem fresh again. This search for youthfulness makes girls’ names more volatile — and increasingly so, as more statistics about names become available and parents grow more willing to experiment</p><p>2 0.94525003 <a title="2212-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-18-Is_it_really_true_that_only_8%25_of_people_who_buy_Herbalife_products_are_Herbalife_distributors%3F.html">1679 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-18-Is it really true that only 8% of people who buy Herbalife products are Herbalife distributors?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>3 0.93823063 <a title="2212-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-14-The_popularity_of_certain_baby_names_is_falling_off_the_clifffffffffffff.html">2211 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-14-The popularity of certain baby names is falling off the clifffffffffffff</a></p>

I was looking at baby name data last night and I stumbled upon something curious. I follow the  baby names blog  occasionally but not regularly, so I’m not sure if it’s been noticed before. Let me present it like this:  Take the statement…


Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.


(… You can pause and try to guess now. Spoilers to follow.)


Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier).  J is heavily overrepresented, especial</p><p>4 0.93791866 <a title="2212-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-13-Can_you_write_a_program_to_determine_the_causal_order%3F.html">1801 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-13-Can you write a program to determine the causal order?</a></p>

Kaggle.com has launched a  competition  to determine what’s an effect and what’s a cause. They’ve got correlated variables, they’re deprived of context, and you’re asked to determine the causal order.  $5,000 prizes.
  
I followed the link and the example they gave didn’t make much sense to me (the two variables were temperature and altitude of cities in Germany, and they said that altitude causes temperature).  It has the feeling to me of one of those weird standardized tests we used to see sometimes in school, where there’s no real correct answer so the goal is to figure out what the test-writer wanted you to say.
 
Nonetheless, this might be of interest, so I’m passing it along to you.</p><p>5 0.93559456 <a title="2212-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-03-Redundancy_and_efficiency%3A__In_praise_of_Penn_Station.html">1245 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-03-Redundancy and efficiency:  In praise of Penn Station</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In reaction to  this  news article by Michael Kimmelman, I’d like to repost  this  from four years ago:
  
Walking through Penn Station in New York, I remembered how much I love its open structure. By “open,” I don’t mean bright and airy. I mean “open” in a topological sense. The station has three below-ground levels–the uppermost has ticket counters (and, what is more relevant nowadays, ticket machines), some crappy stores and restaurants, and a crappy waiting area. The middle level has Long Island Rail Road ticket counters, some more crappy stores and restaurants, and entrances to the 7th and 8th Avenue subway lines. The lower level has train tracks and platforms. There are stairs, escalators, and elevators going everywhere. As a result, it’s easy to get around, there are lots of shortcuts, and the train loads fast–some people come down the escalators and elevators from the top level, others take the stairs from the middle level.

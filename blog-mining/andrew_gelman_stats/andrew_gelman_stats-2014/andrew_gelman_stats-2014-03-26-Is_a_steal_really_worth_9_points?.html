My question is about Bayesian analysis of the linear regression model. It seems to me that in some cases this approach throws out useful information.


As an example, imagine you have two basketball players randomly drawn from the pool of NBA players (which provides the prior). You’d like to estimate how many free throws each can make out of 100. You have two pieces of information:


- Session 1: Each player shoots 100 shots, and you learn player A’s total minus player B’s total


- Session 2: Player A does another session where he shoots 100 shots alone, and you learn his total


If we take the regression approach:


y_i = number of shots made 
beta_A = player A’s expected number out of 100 
beta_B = player B’s expected number out of 100 
x_i = vector of zeros and ones showing which player took shots


In the above example, our datapoints are:

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  discussion  from the other day, Angelika van der Linde sends along  this paper  from 2012 (link to journal  here ).
 
And Aki pulls out this great quote from Geisser and Eddy (1979):
  
This discussion makes clear that in the nested case this method, as Akaike’s, is not consistent; i.e., even if $M_k$ is true, it will be rejected with probability $\alpha$ as $N\to\infty$. This point is also made by Schwarz (1978).  However, from the point of view of prediction, this is of no great consequence. For large numbers of observations, a prediction based on the falsely assumed $M_k$, will not differ appreciably from one based on the true $M_k$.  For example, if we assert that two normal populations have different means when in fact they have the same mean, then the use of the group mean as opposed to the grand mean for predicting a future observation results in predictors which are asymptotically equivalent and whose predictive variances are $\sigma^2[1 + (1/2n)]$ and $\si</p><p>6 0.11511656 <a title="2267-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-02-Fighting_a_losing_battle.html">1518 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-02-Fighting a losing battle</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>4 0.772403 <a title="2267-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-17-Weak_identification_provides_partial_information.html">1903 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-17-Weak identification provides partial information</a></p>

We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting. The answers came in between 65% and 70%.






The true answer [based on Dan's analysis of a database of baseball games]: 51.3%, a little better than a coin toss.
  
I have to say, I’m surprised his colleagues gave such extreme guesses.  I was guessing something like 50%, myself, based on the following very crude reasoning:
 
Suppose two unequal teams are playing, and the chance of team A beating team B is 55%.  (This seems like a reasonable average of all matchups, which will include some more extreme disparities but also many more equal contests.)

<p>Introduction: Theodore Vasiloudis writes:
  
I’d like to bring your attention to  this article  by Benjamin Morris discussing the value of steals for the NBA. The author argues that a steal should be a highly sought after statistic as it equates to higher chances of victory and is very hard to replace when a player is injured.


I would argue that the reason behind the correlations showing this data is the fact that steals are much more rare in an NBA game than any of the other stats examined so their contribution is exaggerated.
  
I looked at Morris’s article and it looks like he’s running a regression of players’ plus-minus statistics on points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals and turnovers.  He writes, “A marginal steal is weighted nine times more heavily when predicting a player’s impact than a marginal point.  For example, a player who averages 16 points and two steals per game is predicted (assuming all else is equal) to have a similar impact on his team’s success as one who averages 25 poi</p><p>2 0.8761909 <a title="2267-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-31-Untunable_Metropolis.html">833 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-31-Untunable Metropolis</a></p>

What are we to make of it when a Metropolis-Hastings step just won’t tune? That is, the acceptance rate is zero at expected-jump-size X, and way above 1/2 at X-exp(-16) (i.e.,  machine precision ).


I’ve solved my practical problem by writing that I would have liked to include results from a diffuse prior, but couldn’t. But I’m bothered by the poverty of my intuition. And since everything I’ve read says this is an issue of efficiency, rather than accuracy, I wonder if I could solve it just by running massive and heavily thinned chains.
  
My reply:
 
I can’t see how this could happen in a well-specified problem!  I suspect it’s a bug.  Otherwise try rescaling your variables so that your parameters will have values on the order of magnitude of 1.
 
To which Margolis responded:
  
I hardly wrote any of the code, so I can’t speak to the bug question — it’s binomial kriging from the R package geoRglm.

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.

<p>Introduction: In response to our  recent posting  of Amazon’s offer of Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition at 40% off, some people asked what was in this new edition, with more information beyond the beautiful cover image and the  brief paragraph  I’d posted earlier.
 
 Here’s  the table of contents.  The following sections have all-new material:
 
1.4 New introduction of BDA principles using a simple spell checking example 
2.9 Weakly informative prior distributions 
5.7 Weakly informative priors for hierarchical variance parameters 
7.1-7.4 Predictive accuracy for model evaluation and comparison 
10.6 Computing environments 
11.4 Split R-hat 
11.5 New measure of effective number of simulation draws 
13.7 Variational inference 
13.8 Expectation propagation 
13.9 Other approximations 
14.6 Regularization for regression models 
C.1 Getting started with R and Stan 
C.2 Fitting a hierarchical model in Stan 
C.4 Programming Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in R

<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”


Well, here’s what you can find on Google.

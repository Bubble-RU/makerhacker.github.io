<p>Introduction: We’re working with polling company YouGov to track public opinion, state-by-state and district-by-district, during the 2014 campaign.  We’ll be using multilevel regression and poststratification, and implementing it in Stan, and developing the necessary new parts of Stan to get this running scalably and efficiently.  And we’ll be making the most detailed, up-to-date election forecasts.
 
What you’ll be doing if you join us as a postdoc: 
- You’ll be in the midst of the most advanced polling team anywhere; 
- You’ll be doing cutting-edge statistical research on MRP with deep interactions; 
- You’ll be doing basic research in statistical computing, developing fast and scalable deterministic and stochastic algorithms for fitting multilevel models; 
- You’ll be working inside Stan, the most advanced general computational framework for Bayesian analysis. 
 We’re doing research, not just implementing existing methods.

<p>Introduction: According to  Chris Wilson , there are two versions of the report of the Occupy Wall Street poll from  so-called  hack pollster Doug Schoen.
 
 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.

<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis wrote  this  useful news article on the promise and limitations of “big data.”
 
And let me add this related point:
 
Big data are typically not random samples, hence the need for “big model” to map from sample to population.   Here’s an example  (with Wei Wang, David Rothschild, and Sharad Goel): 
  
  
Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked for whom they intend to vote. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable financial and time costs. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical ben- efits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and often faster and at less expense than traditional survey methods.

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.

HuffPost Pollster has an immediate opening for a social and data scientist to join us full time, preferably in our Washington D.C. bureau, to work on development and improvement of our poll tracking models and political forecasts.


You are someone who has:


* A passion for electoral politics,


* Advanced training in statistics and dynamic Bayesian data analysis,


* A Ph.D. in statistics, political science, economics or the social sciences or comparable high level training or experience,


* A desire to make a lasting contribution in the way the news media cover polls and elections.


We are:


* The award-winning website formerly known as  Pollster.com , which joined the Huffington Post in 2010 and remains the internet’s premier source for uniquely interactive polling charts and electorate forecasts and a running daily commentary that explains, demystifies and critiques political polling.

<p>Introduction: Christian Robert is  planning  a graduate seminar in which students read 15 classic articles of statistics.  (See  here  for more details and a slightly different list.)
 
Actually, he just writes “classics,” but based on his list, I assume he only wants articles, not books.  If he wanted to include classic books, I’d nominate the following, just for starters: 
- Fisher’s Statistical Methods for Research Workers 
- Snedecor and Cochran’s Statistical Methods 
- Kish’s Survey Sampling 
- Box, Hunter, and Hunter’s Statistics for Experimenters 
- Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Cleveland’s The Elements of Graphing Data 
- Mosteller and Wallace’s book on the Federalist Papers. 
Probably Cox and Hinkley, too.  That’s a book that I don’t think has aged well, but it seems to have had a big influence.
 
I think there’s a lot more good and accessible material in these classic books than in the equivalent volume of classic articles.  Journal articles can be difficult to read and are typicall</p><p>3 0.92120314 <a title="2221-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-Data_visualization_marathon.html">304 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-Data visualization marathon</a></p>

<p>Introduction: American University in Washington, D.C. has  two full-time tenure-line positions available :
  
An ideal candidate will have facility with computation, and can identify specific prospects for on-campus collaboration, possibly interdepartmental. We are particularly interested in candidates who can assist colleagues who need to deal with data sets that are too large, distributed, or heterogeneous to be amenable to traditional methods of analysis. From a mathematician, we also seek a research program with deep roots in mathematics.  From a statistician, we seek a familiarity with Bayesian modeling. We are open to researchers who ignore traditional disciplinary boundaries.
  
I like the bits about computation, interdepartmental, and Bayesian modeling.  My former colleagues at Berkeley would be spinning in their theorems were they to see this (but, don’t worry, I doubt they read blogs).  I really do think that computation is more important than theorem-proving.  Both are important (for exam</p><p>5 0.92089432 <a title="2221-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-21-How_many_data_points_do_you_really_have%3F.html">1178 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-21-How many data points do you really have?</a></p>

I have just come across your paper in the 2009 American Scientist. Another problem that I frequently come across is when people do power spectral analyses of signals. If one has 1200 points (fairly modest in this day and age) then there are 600 power spectral estimates. People will then determine the 95% confidence limits and pick out any spectral estimate that sticks up above this, claiming that it is significant. But there will be on average 30 estimates that stick up too high or too low. So in general there will be 15 spectral estimates which are higher than the 95% confidence limit which could happen just by chance. I suppose that this means that you have to set a much higher confidence limit, which would depend on the number of data in your signal.


I would also like your opinion about  a paper  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, “The causality analysis of climate change and large-scale

<p>Introduction: OK, I’ve given up on  theme weeks .  I have enough saved-up material to do it, and it wouldn’t be too much trouble to group the scheduled posts into themes, but there doesn’t really seem to be a point.  I say this because, having looked at the comment threads from the past few weeks, the comments seem pretty much tied to individual posts in any case.  So I think I’ll go back to the old system where each post stands alone.
 
Just for fun I thought I’d run a week’s worth of old posts, just some things I came across when searching for various things.  Of course I could just post the links right here but instead I’ll repost with my comments on how things have changed in the intervening years.

<p>Introduction: I came across  this  from Jeff Sachs:
  
[Bill Easterly in his 2006 book] went on to write that “a study of a program to hand out free [malaria bed] nets in Zambia to people … found that 70 percent of the recipients didn’t use the nets.” Yet this particular study, which was conducted by the American Red Cross and CORE, actually showed the program was a success, with high rates of net adoption.
  
Sachs provides a link to  this 2004 study .
 
I followed the link and took a quick look at the study, and indeed in the intro it says, “Household ITN coverage increased from 28.9 percent (pre-campaign) to 85 percent (with a greater than 80 percent coverage across all wealth quintiles). . . . At six months post-campaign . . . and 60 percent of the pregnant women and children under 5 years old were reported to have slept under the net the previous night.”
 
60% of 85% is far from ideal but it’s a lot higher than “70 percent of the recipients didn’t use the nets.”  But I am no expert in this area</p><p>3 0.95979393 <a title="2320-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-An_IV_won%E2%80%99t_save_your_life_if_the_line_is_tangled.html">550 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-An IV won’t save your life if the line is tangled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  See section 4 of  this article .
 
More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

<p>Introduction: From my  New York Times blog  today, here’s an example of how contemporaneous poll results can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
 
Recently in the New Republic,  William Galston  shared some recent findings from Gallup:
  
Respondents were asked to categorize three economic objectives as extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not important. Here’s what they said:


Extremely/very important          Somewhat/not important


Grow and expand the economy                                         82                                            18


Increase equality of opportunity for people to get ahead                                             70                                            30


Reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and the poor                                  46                                            54

<p>Introduction: Ed Glaeser  writes :
  
The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York is often credited with saying that the way to create a great city is to “create a great university and wait 200 years,” and the body of evidence on the role that universities play in generating urban growth continues to grow.
  
I’ve always thought this too, that it’s too bad that, given the total cost, a lot more cities would’ve benefited, over the years, by maintaining great universities rather than building expensive freeways, RenCens, and so forth.
 
But Joseph Delaney  argues the opposite , considering the case of New Haven, home of what is arguably the second-best university in the country (I assume Glaeser would agree with me on this one):
  
 
According to wikipedia, the poverty rate in New Haven is 24%, which compares unfavorably with the rest of the United States where it is 14%. The poverty rate in New Haven, despite the presence of Yale, is nearly twice that of the United States as a whole.

<p>Introduction: I post (approximately) once a day and don’t plan to change that.
 
I have enough material to post more often—for example, I could intersperse existing blog posts with summaries of my published papers or of other work that I like; and, beyond this, we currently have a one-to-two-month backlog of posts—but I’m afraid that if the number of posts were doubled, the attention given to each would be roughly halved.
 
Looking at it the other way, I certainly don’t want to  reduce  my level of posting.  Sure, it takes time to blog, but these are things that are important for me to say.  If I were to blog less frequently, it would only be because I was pouring all these words into a different vessel, for example a book.  For now, though, I think it makes sense to blog and then collect the words later as appropriate.  With blogging I get comments, and many of these comments are helpful—either directly (by pointing out errors in my thinking or linking to relevant software or literature) or indirec</p><p>3 0.28752166 <a title="2244-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.  The second paper, in particular, took some effort to place; I got some advice from colleagues in sociology as to where</p><p>4 0.27674574 <a title="2244-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-30-Systematic_review_of_publication_bias_in_studies_on_publication_bias.html">1291 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-30-Systematic review of publication bias in studies on publication bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>5 0.22245838 <a title="2244-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-04-Literal_vs._rhetorical.html">2233 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-04-Literal vs. rhetorical</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>4 0.87740582 <a title="2244-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-I_posted_this_as_a_comment_on_a_sociology_blog.html">2353 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-I posted this as a comment on a sociology blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.

Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived. Of the remaining 45 citations, 44 cited the Me</p><p>6 0.87313223 <a title="2244-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-19-The_replication_and_criticism_movement_is_not_about_suppressing_speculative_research%3B_rather%2C_it%E2%80%99s_all_about_enabling_science%E2%80%99s_fabled_self-correcting_nature.html">2217 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-19-The replication and criticism movement is not about suppressing speculative research; rather, it’s all about enabling science’s fabled self-correcting nature</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In our recent discussion of modes of publication, Joseph Wilson wrote, “The single best reform science can make right now is to decouple publication from career advancement, thereby reducing the number of publications by an order of magnitude and then move to an entirely disjointed, informal, online free-for-all communication system for research results.”
 
My first thought on this was: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. But then I got to thinking: what would it  really  mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me—I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future—but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).
 
However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should’ve just typed it all in then.  In the old days I just wouldn’t run this</p><p>2 0.96391487 <a title="2244-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-16-%E2%80%9CFalse-positive_psychology%E2%80%9D.html">1171 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-16-“False-positive psychology”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>4 0.96378684 <a title="2244-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-With_a_bit_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_again_on_this_topic%2C_and_with_a_lot_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_today.html">576 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-With a bit of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post again on this topic, and with a lot of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post today</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Masse points me to  this response  by Daryl Bem and two statisticians (Jessica Utts and Wesley Johnson) to criticisms by Wagenmakers et.al. of Bem’s recent ESP study.  I have nothing to add but would like to repeat a couple bits of my discussions of last month, of  here :
  
Classical statistical methods that work reasonably well when studying moderate or large effects (see the work of Fisher, Snedecor, Cochran, etc.) fall apart in the presence of small effects.


I think it’s naive when people implicitly assume that the study’s claims are correct, or the study’s statistical methods are weak. Generally, the smaller the effects you’re studying, the better the statistics you need. ESP is a field of small effects and so ESP researchers use high-quality statistics.


To put it another way: whatever methodological errors happen to be in the paper in question, probably occur in lots of researcher papers in “legitimate” psychology research. The difference is that when you’re studying a</p><p>5 0.96220326 <a title="2244-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-The_importance_of_style_in_academic_writing.html">902 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-The importance of style in academic writing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my comments on  academic cheating , I briefly discussed the question of how some of these papers could’ve been published in the first place, given that they tend to be of low quality.  (It’s rare that people plagiarize the good stuff, and, when they do—for example when a senior scholar takes credit for a junior researcher’s contributions without giving proper credit—there’s not always a paper trail, and there can be legitimate differences of opinion about the relative contributions of the participants.)
 
Anyway, to get back to the cases at hand:  how did these rulebreakers get published in the first place?  The question here is not how did they get away with cheating but how is it that top journals were publishing mediocre research? 
   
In the case of the profs who falsified data (Diederik Stapel) or did not follow scientific protocol (Mark Hauser), the answer is clear:  By cheating, they were able to get the sort of too-good-to-be-true results which, if they  were  true, would be</p><p>6 0.95853817 <a title="2244-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties_with_measurement-error_models_for_the_evaluation_of_wacky_claims.html">803 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties with measurement-error models for the evaluation of wacky claims</a></p>

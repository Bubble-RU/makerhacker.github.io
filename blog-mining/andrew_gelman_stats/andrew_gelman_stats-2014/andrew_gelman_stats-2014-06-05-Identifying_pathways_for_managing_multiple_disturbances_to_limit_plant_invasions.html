<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.

Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.

The idea that species diversity can influence ecosystem functioning has been controversial and its importance relative to compositional effects hotly debated. Unfortunately, assessing the relative importance of different explanatory variables in complex linear models is not simple. In this paper we assess the relative importance of species richness and species composition in a multilevel model analysis of net aboveground biomass production in grassland biodiversity experiments by estimating variance components for all explanatory variables. We compare the variance components using  a recently introduced graphical Bayesian ANOVA  [emphasis added]. We show that while the use of test statistics and the R2 gives contradictory assessments, the variance components analysis reveals that species</p><p>4 0.080303058 <a title="2360-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning_to_Stan.html">2291 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning to Stan</a></p>

I’ve been happily using R for a number of years now and recently came across Stan. Looks big and powerful, so I’d like to pick an appropriate project and try it out. I wondered if you could point me to a link or document that goes into the motivation for this tool (aside from the Stan user doc)?  What I’d like to understand is, at what point might you look at an emergent R project and advise, “You know, that thing you’re trying to do would be a whole lot easier/simpler/more straightforward to implement with Stan.” (or words to that effect).
  
My reply:  For my collaborators in political science, Stan has been most useful for models where the data set is not huge (e.g., we might have 10,000 data points or 50,000 data points but not 10 million) but where the model is somewhat complex (for example, a model with latent time series structure).  The point is that the model has enough parameters and uncertainty that you’ll want to do full Bayes (rather than some sort</p><p>5 0.079899155 <a title="2360-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated%3A__A_place_to_post_your_statistics_questions.html">1061 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated:  A place to post your statistics questions</a></p>

I [Rogers] am a member of an online community of statisticians where I burn a great deal of time (and a recovering cog sci researcher). Our community website is a peer-reviewed Q and A spanning stats topics ranging from applications to mathematical theory. Our online community consists of mostly university faculty, grad students and technical consultants. The answer quality is very strong and the web design is intuitive. I think you and your readers are like-minded and would be really interested in some of the topics on the site,  CrossValidated  (you may know the sister site:  stackoverflow.com ). The philosophy is purely to further knowledge for the sake of knowledge and take pride in learning.
  
I took a quick look and the site seemed like it could be useful to people.  The only thing I didn’t understand is, why doesn’t it have a search function?  (Or maybe it was there somewhere and I couldn’t find it.)

<p>Introduction: We’re happy to announce the release of Stan C++, CmdStan, 
RStan, and PyStan 2.1.0.  This is a minor feature release, 
but it is also an important bug fix release.  As always, the 
place to start is the (all new) Stan web pages:
 
 http://mc-stan.org 
 
 
 
 Major Bug in 2.0.0, 2.0.1 
 
Stan 2.0.0 and Stan 2.0.1 introduced a bug in the implementation 
of the NUTS criterion that led to poor tail exploration and 
thus biased the posterior uncertainty downward.  There was no 
bug in NUTS in Stan 1.3 or earlier, and 2.1 has been extensively tested 
and tests put in place so this problem will not recur.
 
If you are using Stan 2.0.0 or 2.0.1, you should switch to 2.1.0 as 
soon as possible and rerun any models you care about.
 
 
 
 New Target Acceptance Rate Default for Stan 2.1.0 
  Another big change aimed at reducing posterior estimation bias 
was an increase in the target acceptance rate during adaptation 
from 0.65 to 0.80.  The bad news is that iterations will take 
around 50% longer</p><p>3 0.67558479 <a title="2360-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>

Stan ( mc-stan.org ) is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We discuss how Stan works and what it can do, the problems that motivated us to write Stan, current challenges, and areas of planned development, including tools for improved generality and usability, more efficient sampling algorithms, and fuller integration of model building, model checking, and model understanding in Bayesian data analysis.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Tanentzap, William Lee, Adrian Monks, Kate Ladley, Peter Johnson, Geoffrey Rogers, Joy Comrie, Dean Clarke, and Ella Hayman  write :
  
We tested a multivariate hypothesis about the causal mechanisms underlying plant invasions in an ephemeral wetland in South Island, New Zealand to inform management of this biodiverse but globally imperilled habitat. . . . We found that invasion by non-native plants was lowest in sites where the physical disturbance caused by flooding was both intense and frequent. . . . only species adapted to the dominant disturbance regimes at a site may become successful invaders.

causal networks; community dynamics; functional traits, invasive species, kettlehole; megafauna; rabbits; restoration; turf plants

<p>Introduction: David LeBauer points me to  this article  in PLoS One by Andy Hector, Thomas Bell, Yann Hautier, Forest Isbell, Marc Kéry, Peter Reich, Jasper van Ruijven, and Bernhard Schmid.  Here’s the abstract:
  
The idea that species diversity can influence ecosystem functioning has been controversial and its importance relative to compositional effects hotly debated. Unfortunately, assessing the relative importance of different explanatory variables in complex linear models is not simple. In this paper we assess the relative importance of species richness and species composition in a multilevel model analysis of net aboveground biomass production in grassland biodiversity experiments by estimating variance components for all explanatory variables. We compare the variance components using  a recently introduced graphical Bayesian ANOVA  [emphasis added]. We show that while the use of test statistics and the R2 gives contradictory assessments, the variance components analysis reveals that species</p><p>3 0.82538402 <a title="2360-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-05-Taking_philosophical_arguments_literally.html">17 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-05-Taking philosophical arguments literally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>4 0.82323134 <a title="2360-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-%E2%80%9CRoughly_90%25_of_the_increase_in_._._.%E2%80%9D__Hey%2C_wait_a_minute%21.html">549 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-“Roughly 90% of the increase in . . .”  Hey, wait a minute!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  links  approvingly to the following  statement  by Michael Mandel:
  
Homeland Security accounts for roughly 90% of the increase in federal regulatory employment over the past ten years.
  
Roughly 90%, huh?  That sounds pretty impressive.  But wait a minute . . . what if total federal regulatory employment had increased a bit less.  Then Homeland Security could’ve accounted for 105% of the increase, or 500% of the increase, or whatever.  The point is the change in total employment is the sum of a bunch of pluses and minuses.  It happens that, if you don’t count Homeland Security, the total hasn’t changed much–I’m assuming Mandel’s numbers are correct here–and that could be interesting.
 
The “roughly 90%” figure is misleading because, when written as a percent of the total increase, it’s natural to quickly envision it as a percentage that is bounded by 100%. There is a total increase in regulatory employment that the individual agencies sum to, but some margins are p</p><p>5 0.8224895 <a title="2360-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-30-The_spam_just_gets_weirder_and_weirder.html">1698 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-30-The spam just gets weirder and weirder</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the inbox today, under the header, “Hidden Costs behind Milk & Dairy Consumption (video)”:
  
Hey Professor Gelman,


Our site’s production team recently released a short video uncovering the local and global impact that milk has on our lives.


After spending some time on your posts, I noticed you talked about dairy products and milk so I thought I’d email you. Are you the correct person to contact in regards to the content on the site? 


If so, let me know if you’re interested in checking out the video.


Thanks, 
Emily S.
  
Hmmm . . . I guess I do talk a lot about dairy products and milk on this site!</p><p>6 0.81721103 <a title="2360-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-18-Economic_Disparities_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_European_Regions.html">97 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-18-Economic Disparities and Life Satisfaction in European Regions</a></p>

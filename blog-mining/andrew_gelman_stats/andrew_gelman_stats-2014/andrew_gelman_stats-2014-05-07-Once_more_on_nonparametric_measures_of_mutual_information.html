It is useful to distinguish between the univariate and multivariate methods. A consistent multivariate method can recognise dependence between two vectors of random variables, while a univariate method can only loop over pairs of components and check for dependency between them.


There are very few consistent multivariate methods. To the best of our  knowledge there are three practical methods:

Kinney and Atwal’s paper is interesting, with my only criticism being that in some places they seem to aim for what might not be possible.  For example, they write that “mutual information is already widely believed to quantify dependencies without bias for relationships of one type or another,” which seems a bit vague to me.  And later they write, “How to compute such an estimate that does not bias the resulting mutual information value remains an open problem,” which seems to me to miss the point in that unbiased statistical estimates are not generally possible and indeed are often not desirable.

Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

<p>Introduction: Malka Gorfine, Ruth Heller, and Yair Heller write a comment on the paper of Reshef et al. that we  discussed  a few months ago.
 
Just to remind you what’s going on here, here’s my quick summary from December:
  
Reshef et al. propose a new nonlinear R-squared-like measure.


Unlike R-squared, this new method depends on a tuning parameter that controls the level of discretization, in a “How long is the coast of Britain” sort of way. The dependence on scale is inevitable for such a general method. Just consider: if you sample 1000 points from the unit bivariate normal distribution, (x,y) ~ N(0,I), you’ll be able to fit them perfectly by a 999-degree polynomial fit to the data. So the scale of the fit matters.


The clever idea of the paper is that, instead of going for an absolute measure (which, as we’ve seen, will be scale-dependent), they focus on the problem of summarizing the grid of pairwise dependences in a large set of variables. As they put it: “Imagine a data set with hundreds</p><p>5 0.81498039 <a title="2324-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-04-Too_many_MC%E2%80%99s_not_enough_MIC%E2%80%99s%2C_or_What_principles_should_govern_attempts_to_summarize_bivariate_associations_in_large_multivariate_datasets%3F.html">1706 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-04-Too many MC’s not enough MIC’s, or What principles should govern attempts to summarize bivariate associations in large multivariate datasets?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Justin Kinney writes:
  
Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

<p>Introduction: Malka Gorfine, Ruth Heller, and Yair Heller write a comment on the paper of Reshef et al. that we  discussed  a few months ago.
 
Just to remind you what’s going on here, here’s my quick summary from December:
  
Reshef et al. propose a new nonlinear R-squared-like measure.


Unlike R-squared, this new method depends on a tuning parameter that controls the level of discretization, in a “How long is the coast of Britain” sort of way. The dependence on scale is inevitable for such a general method. Just consider: if you sample 1000 points from the unit bivariate normal distribution, (x,y) ~ N(0,I), you’ll be able to fit them perfectly by a 999-degree polynomial fit to the data. So the scale of the fit matters.


The clever idea of the paper is that, instead of going for an absolute measure (which, as we’ve seen, will be scale-dependent), they focus on the problem of summarizing the grid of pairwise dependences in a large set of variables. As they put it: “Imagine a data set with hundreds</p><p>4 0.83014113 <a title="2324-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism_as_a_form_of_voluntarism.html">482 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism as a form of voluntarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  by Alex Tabarrok (following up on an article by Rebecca Solnit) on the continuum between voluntarism (or, more generally, non-cash transactions) and markets with monetary exchange.  I just have a few comments of my own:
 
1.  Solnit writes of “the iceberg economy,” which she characterizes as “based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return . . . the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit.”  I just wonder whether “barter” completely fits in here.  Maybe it depends on context.  Sometimes barter is an informal way of keeping track (you help me and I help you), but in settings of low liquidity I could imagine barter being simply an inefficient way of performing an economic transaction.
 
2.  I am no expert on capitalism but my impression is that it’s not just about “competition and selfishness” but also is related to the</p><p>5 0.82815665 <a title="2324-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-More_by_Berger_and_me_on_weakly_informative_priors.html">1092 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-More by Berger and me on weakly informative priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

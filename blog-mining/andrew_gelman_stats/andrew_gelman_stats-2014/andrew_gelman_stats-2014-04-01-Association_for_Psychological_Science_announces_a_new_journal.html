<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>4 0.15196691 <a title="2278-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-How_can_statisticians_help_psychologists_do_their_research_better%3F.html">1860 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-How can statisticians help psychologists do their research better?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Our statistics book made it possible for Kruschke to write his excellent book for psycholo</p><p>5 0.14841235 <a title="2278-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-Of_psychology_research_and_investment_tips.html">439 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-Of psychology research and investment tips</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few days after “ Dramatic study shows participants are affected by psychological phenomena from the future ,” (see  here ) the British Psychological Society follows up with “ Can psychology help combat pseudoscience? .”

Journals Need to Pick One”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  writes :
  
As long as a journal pursues a strategy of publishing “wow” studies, it will inevitably contain more unreplicable findings and unsupportable conclusions than equally rigorous but more “boring” journals. Groundbreaking will always be higher-risk. And definitive will be the territory of journals that publish meta-analyses and reviews. . . .


Most conclusions, even those in peer-reviewed papers in rigorous journals, should be regarded as tentative at best; but press releases and other public communication rarely convey that. . . .
  
His message to all of us:
  
Our standard response to a paper in Science, Nature, or Psychological Science should be “wow, that’ll be really interesting if it replicates.” And in our teaching and our engagement with the press and public, we need to make clear why that is the most enthusiastic response we can justify.</p><p>4 0.821298 <a title="2278-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-17-The_Washington_Post_reprints_university_press_releases_without_editing_them.html">2215 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-17-The Washington Post reprints university press releases without editing them</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .  But I wonder how the profs in the psych d</p><p>5 0.78994703 <a title="2278-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-How_should_journals_handle_replication_studies%3F.html">762 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-How should journals handle replication studies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  reports :
  
Recently  Ben Goldacre wrote  about a group of researchers (Stuart Ritchie, Chris French, and Richard Wiseman) whose null replication of 3 experiments from the infamous Bem ESP paper was rejected by JPSP – the same journal that published Bem’s paper.
  
Srivastava recognizes that JPSP does not usually publish replications but this is a different story because it’s an anti-replication.
 
Here’s the paradox:
 
- From a scientific point of view, the Ritchie et al. results are boring.  To find out that there’s no evidence for ESP . . . that adds essentially zero to our scientific understanding.  What next, a paper demonstrating that pigeons can fly higher than chickens?  Maybe an article in the Journal of the Materials Research Society demonstrating that diamonds can scratch marble but not the reverse??
 
- But from a science-communication perspective, the null replication is a big deal because it adds credence to  my hypothesis  that the earlier ESP claims</p><p>6 0.76934105 <a title="2278-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-31-How_to_fix_the_tabloids%3F__Toward_replicable_social_science_research.html">1878 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-31-How to fix the tabloids?

<p>Introduction: The Association for Psychological Science, the leading organization of research psychologists, announced a long-awaited new journal,  Speculations on Psychological Science .  From the official APS press release:
  
Speculations on Psychological Science, the flagship journal of the Association for Psychological Science, will publish cutting-edge research articles, short reports, and research reports spanning the entire spectrum of the science of psychology. We anticipate that Speculations on Psychological Science will be the highest ranked empirical journal in psychology. We recognize that many of the most noteworthy published claims in psychology and related fields are not well supported by data, hence the need for a journal for the publication of such exciting speculations without misleading claims of certainty.


- Sigmund Watson, Prof. (Ret.) Miskatonic University, and editor-in-chief, Speculations on Psychological Science

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>4 0.85721642 <a title="2278-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-15-New_prize_on_causality_in_statstistics_education.html">1624 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-15-New prize on causality in statstistics education</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judea Pearl writes:
  
Can you post the announcement below on your blog? And, by all means, if you find heresy in my interview with Ron Wasserstein, feel free to criticize it with your readers.
  
I responded that I’m not religious, so he’ll have to look for someone else if he’s looking for findings of heresy.  I did, however, want to share his announcement:
  
The American Statistical Association has announced  a new Prize , “Causality in Statistics Education”, aimed to encourage the teaching of basic causal inference in introductory statistics courses.  


The motivations for the prize are discussed in  an interview  I [Pearl] gave to Ron Wasserstein. I hope readers of this list will participate, either by innovating new tools for teaching causation or by nominating candidates who deserve the prize.  


And speaking about education, Bryant and I [Pearl] have revised  our survey  of econometrics textbooks, and would love to hear your suggestions on how to restore causal inference to e</p><p>5 0.8494333 <a title="2278-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>6 0.84929317 <a title="2278-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-Of_psychology_research_and_investment_tips.html">439 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-Of psychology research and investment tips</a></p>

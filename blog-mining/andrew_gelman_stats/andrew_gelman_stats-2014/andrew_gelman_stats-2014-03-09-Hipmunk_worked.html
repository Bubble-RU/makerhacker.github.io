<p>Introduction: Brendan pointed me to  this  news article by David Pogue promoting a website called  Hipmunk , a sleek competitor to Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, and the like.
 
Coincidentally, I had to a buy a flight  right now  so I followed the link and found that, indeed, Hipmunk is about a zillion times easier to use and more impressive than Expedia or even Kayak.  It’s awesome.  The others aren’t even close.  The display was so clean and effective, I felt like ordering a few flights just for fun.
 
That’s the good news.  Now the bad news.  I wasn’t just playing around with the site.  There was actually a flight I wanted to buy–an itinerary I’d looked into yesterday but hadn’t saved or booked.  I effortlessly set up the request in Hipmunk, scanned its impressive graphical display, and . . . couldn’t find the flight I wanted!  Oh no!  The last ticket must’ve been sold!
 
Just to check, though, I want on good old ugly Expedia.  And my flight was right there!  So I bought it.

As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.  The regular Amtrak website is about as horrible as you’d expect.</p><p>4 0.48204014 <a title="2238-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-20-Last_post_on_Hipmunk.html">917 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-20-Last post on Hipmunk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:

<p>Introduction: This time on a NY-Cincinnati roundtrip.  Hipmunk could find the individual flights but could not put them together.  In contrast, Expedia got it right the first time.
 
See  here  and  here  for background.  If anybody reading this knows David Pogue, please let him know about this.  A flashy interface is fine, but ultimately what Iâ&euro;&trade;m looking for is a flight at the right place and the right time.</p><p>6 0.38084763 <a title="2238-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-07-Hipmunk_FAIL%3A__Graphics_without_content_is_not_enough.html">894 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-07-Hipmunk FAIL:  Graphics without content is not enough</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I love a good GUI but not if it doesn’t give me the information I need.  I  again  tried Hipmunk and it  again  failed (this time for a trip to Baltimore where it gave only a useless subset of the available Amtrak trains).
 
   
 
I don’t know anything about the internet biz.  What I’m guessing is that they set up this cool website that is pretty much functional, with the goal of selling it for a few million dollars to Travelocity or Expedia or Kayak.  What I’m wondering is, why haven’t they made the deal already?  Hipmunk’s GUI is great.  The site is useless because it’s missing so many flights, but if you put it in an actual travel site such as Expedia, it would be great.

<p>Introduction: In the past I’ve categorized Hipmunk as  a really cool flight-finder that doesn’t actually work , as  worse than Expedia , and as  graphics without content .
 
So, I thought it would be only fair to tell you that I bought a flight the other day using Hipmunk and it gave me the same flight as Expedia but at a lower cost (by linking to something called CheapOair, which I hope is legit).  So score one for Hipmunk.</p><p>3 0.87697971 <a title="2238-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-10-%E2%80%9CVersatile%2C_affordable_chicken_has_grown_in_popularity%E2%80%9D.html">655 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-10-“Versatile, affordable chicken has grown in popularity”</a></p>

Today I was reading the 18 Nov 2004 issue of the London Review of Books, which contained (among other things) the following:
 
- A review by Jenny Diski of a biography of Stanley Milgram.  Diski appears to want to debunk:
  
Milgram was a whiz at devising sexy experiments, but barely interested in any theoretical basis for them.  They all have the same instant attractiveness of style, and then an underlying emptiness.
  
Huh?  Michael Jordan couldn’t hit the curveball and he was reportedly an easy mark for golf hustlers but that doesn’t diminish his greatness on the basketball court.

<p>Introduction: Florence from customer support at  Hipmunk  writes:
  
Hipmunk now includes American Airlines in our search results. Please note that users will be taken directly to AA.com to complete the booking/transaction. . . . we are steadily increasing the number of flights that we offer on Hipmunk.
  
As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.  The regular Amtrak website is about as horrible as you’d expect.</p><p>6 0.79700512 <a title="2238-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-09-The_quest_for_the_holy_graph.html">794 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-09-The quest for the holy graph</a></p>

</p><p>4 But Conley and Rauscher only looked at the sex of the first child, so this should not be a problem, right? [sent-9, score-0.356]
</p><p>5 The problem is that in principle one has to control for the covariate of family size, and that is endogenous, and there is no obvious instrumental variable that satisfies an exclusion restriction. [sent-12, score-0.348]
</p><p>6 So, just to clarify, if you  don’t  control for family size, and you only look at sex of first child, then you should be ok. [sent-13, score-0.53]
</p><p>7 But one then should realize that the effect of a daughter includes many different things, including, possibly, the total number of children. [sent-14, score-0.181]
</p><p>8 Suppose, for example, a person has a first child and now you consider two branches:  (a) First child is a daughter. [sent-15, score-0.739]
</p><p>9 In that case, there’s an interaction between party identification and the sex of the first child, and one of the outcomes is #kids. [sent-21, score-0.529]
</p><p>10 So, for example, if having lots of kids (of either sex) has an effect on attitudes, this could show up as an effect of the sex of the first child. [sent-22, score-0.594]
</p><p>11 I sent the above to Oswald, who added:    There is one way to make his result and ours consistent (though not Washington’s I am afraid). [sent-25, score-0.139]
</p><p>12 We actually, because we are doing a panel analysis on the birth of a child, are picking up the effect of a baby girl or baby boy. [sent-26, score-0.461]
</p><p>13 It might be that very young daughters turn me Left, and then much older daughters turn me Right. [sent-27, score-0.326]
</p><p>14 This is related to the famous tradeoffs between  internal and external validity . [sent-33, score-0.203]
</p><p>15 Comparing sex of first child has bulletproof internal validity but it affects the interpretation, in a way similar to “intent to treat” analyses. [sent-34, score-0.87]
</p><p>16 I sent the above to Dalton Conley, who wrote:    I totally agree that what we are doing is a reduced form analysis, essentially. [sent-39, score-0.161]
</p><p>17 First born girl may affect marital status (which we know it does from literature, hence our control) and other things we cannot control for. [sent-40, score-0.199]
</p><p>18 Doesn’t mean that the total effect isn’t what it is, though . [sent-41, score-0.181]
</p><p>19 I think that should be a bigger concern (than reduced form versus direct effects): non random selection into sex of offspring. [sent-45, score-0.485]
</p><p>20 Panel data, of course, does nothing to solve that problem if it’s correlated with unobservables that are themselves correlated with partisanship…. [sent-46, score-0.329]

 This  involves causal inference, hierarchical setup, small effect sizes (in absolute terms), and will doubtless be heavily reported in the media.
  
The article is by Manudeep Bhuller, Tarjei Havnes, Edwin Leuven, and Magne Mogstad and begins as follows:
  
Does internet use trigger sex crime? We use unique Norwegian data on crime and internet adoption to shed light on this question. A public program with limited funding rolled out broadband access points in 2000-2008, and provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental variables and fixed effect estimates show that internet use is associated with a substantial increase in reported incidences of rape and other sex crimes. We present a theoretical framework that highlights three mechanisms for how internet use may affect reported sex crime, namely a reporting effect, a matching effect on potential offenders and victims, and a direct effect on crime propensity. Our results indicate that the</p><p>4 0.19416496 <a title="2193-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-12-More_frustrations_trying_to_replicate_an_analysis_published_in_a_reputable_journal.html">1054 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-12-More frustrations trying to replicate an analysis published in a reputable journal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The story starts in September, when psychology professor Fred Oswald wrote me:
  
I [Oswald] wanted to point out  this paper  in Science (Ramirez & Beilock, 2010) examining how students’ emotional writing improves their test performance in high-pressure situations.


Although replication is viewed as the hallmark of research, this paper replicates implausibly large d-values and correlations across studies, leading me to be more suspicious of the findings (not less, as is generally the case).
  
   
He also pointed me to this paper:
  
Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis.


Frattaroli, Joanne


Psychological Bulletin, Vol 132(6), Nov 2006, 823-865. 


Disclosing information, thoughts, and feelings about personal and meaningful topics (experimental disclosure) is purported to have various health and psychological consequences (e.g., J. W. Pennebaker, 1993). Although the results of 2 small meta-analyses (P. G. Frisina, J. C. Borod, & S. J. Lepore, 2004; J. M.

<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>6 0.16385899 <a title="2193-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-14-Oswald_evidence.html">2134 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-14-Oswald evidence</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There’s something satisfying about seeing the same error being made by commentators on the left and the right.  In this case, we’re talking about  the one-way street fallacy , which is the implicit assumption of unidirectionality in a setting that actually has underlying symmetry.
 
1.  A month or so ago we  reported  on an op-ed by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who was discussing recent research exemplified by the headline, “Study: Having daughters makes parents more likely to be Republican.”  Douthat wrote all about different effects of having girls, without realizing that the study was comparing parents of girls to parents of boys.  He just as well could have talked about the effects of having sons, and how that is associated with voting for Democrats (according to the study).

<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.

<p>Introduction: Andrew has pointed to Jonathan Livengood’s  analysis  of the correlation between poverty and PISA results, whereby schools with poorer students get poorer test results. I’d have written a comment, but then I couldn’t have inserted a chart.
 
Andrew points out that a causal analysis is needed. This reminds me of an intervention that has been done before: take a child out of poverty, and bring him up in a better-off family. What’s going to happen? There have been several studies examining correlations between adoptive and biological parents’ IQ (assuming IQ is a test analogous to the math and verbal tests, and that parent IQ is analogous to the quality of instruction – but the point is in the analysis not in the metric). This is the result (from  Adoption Strategies  by Robin P Corley in Encyclopedia of Life Sciences):
 
 
 
So, while it did make a difference at an early age, with increasing age of the adopted child, the intelligence of adoptive parents might not be making any difference</p><p>6 0.74002832 <a title="2193-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-22-Struggles_over_the_criticism_of_the_%E2%80%9Ccannabis_users_and_IQ_change%E2%80%9D_paper.html">1910 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-22-Struggles over the criticism of the “cannabis users and IQ change” paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We recently considered a pair of studies that came out awhile ago involving children and political orientation: Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely to support left-wing parties, compared to parents of boys. And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys.
 
As I  discussed  the other day, the latest version of the Conley and Raucher study came with some incoherent evolutionary theorizing.  There was also some discussion regarding the differences between the two studies.
 
Oswald sent me some relevant comments:
  
It will be hard in cross-sections like the GSS to solve the problem of endogeneity bias. Conservative families may want to have boys, and may use that as a stopping rule.  If so, they will end up with disproportionately large number of girls.

<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>3 0.95042694 <a title="2193-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-The_scope_for_snooping.html">1070 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-The scope for snooping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys sent the following question to David Madigan and me: 
  
  
I am working on a piece on the registration of research designs (to prevent snooping). As part of it we want to give some estimates for the “scope for snooping” and how this can be affected by different registration requirements.


So we want to answer questions of the form: 
“Say in truth there is no relation between x and y, you were willing to mess about with models until you found a significant relation between them, what are the chances that you would succeed if: 
1. You were free to choose the indicators for x and y 
2. You were free to choose h control variable from some group of k possible 
controls 
3. You were free to divide up the sample in k ways to examine heterogeneous treatment effects 
4. You were free to select from some set of k reasonable models”

On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>5 0.94532597 <a title="2193-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-30-More_on_problems_with_surveys_estimating_deaths_in_war_zones.html">12 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-30-More on problems with surveys estimating deaths in war zones</a></p>

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.

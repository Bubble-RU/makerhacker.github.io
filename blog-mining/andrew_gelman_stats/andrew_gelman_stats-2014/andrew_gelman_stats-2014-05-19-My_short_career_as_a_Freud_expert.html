Is there some sort of Glengarry Glen Ross-like parallel world where down-on-their-luck Jack Lemmons of public relations world send out electronic cold calls?  More than anything else, this sort of thing makes me glad I have a steady job.
 
Here’s the (unsolicited) email, which came with the subject line “Please help a reporter do his job”:
  
Dear Andrew,


As an Editor for the Bulldog Reporter (www.bulldogreporter.com/dailydog), a media relations trade publication, my job is to help ensure that my readers have accurate info about you and send you the best quality pitches. By taking five minutes or less to answer my questions (pasted below), you’ll receive targeted PR pitches from our client base that will match your beat and interests.

Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Dr. Gelman, 


I made contact last year regarding your work in the CMG: Reconstructing Climate from Tree Ring Data project. We are about to start producing the 2014 edition and I wanted to discuss this with you as we still remain keen to feature your work. 


Research Media are producing a special publication in February of 2014, within this report we will be working with a small selected number of PI’s with a focus on geosciences, atmospheric and geospace sciences and earth Sciences.. 
  
At this point, I’m thinking:  Hmmm, I don’t remember this guy, is this some sort of collaborative project that I’d forgotten about?
 
The message then continues:
  
The publication is called International Innovation . . .
  
Huh?  This doesn’t sound so good.  The email then goes on with some very long lists, and then finally the kicker:

Hi Andrew,

Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).

<p>Introduction: I received the following email the other day (well, actually it was the other month, as we’re still on blog-delay):
  
Dear Prof. Andrew Gelman,


The ** Broadcasting Authority, together with ** – a well-established production company, are producing a documentary about Freud.


The documentary presents different points of view regarding Freud’s personality and theories. 
At this stage of the production we are mainly interested in views regarding the influence Freud / Freudism / Psychoanalysis have on our culture – whether positive or negative. We are addressing the effect Freud and/or analysis left on the culture regarding morality, the law system, therapy, art, consumerism, films, etc. We would like to interview you on your point of view regarding Freud’s mark on humanity in regard to the Economy.


Once you respond favorably we can proceed and precisely define the topics of the talk. 
The shooting in NYC is on May 27th and should not demand more than one hour of your time. 
We’ll app</p><p>2 0.90381461 <a title="2338-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-24-In_case_you_were_wondering%2C_here%E2%80%99s_the_price_of_milk.html">588 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-24-In case you were wondering, here’s the price of milk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seeing Sarah Palin’s recent  witticism :
  
It’s no wonder Michelle Obama is telling everybody you need to breast feed your babies … the price of milk is so high!
  
I was reminded of Dan Quayle’s quip during the 1988 campaign:
  
The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber ducky drowned in the bathtub.
  
And this got me wondering:  how often do legitimate political figures–not talk show hosts, but actual politicians–communicate via schoolyard-style taunts?
  

 
I’m not talking here about dry wit of the Bob Dole or Morris Udall variety, or political gamesmanship such as Ronald Reagan’s “make my day,” or flat-out partisanship like Alan Grayson’s “the Republicans want you to die quickly” or James Watt’s line about “liberals and Americans.”  It’s gotta be an actual joke.
 
There must be some other examples of Palin/Quayle style humor, but I’m not sure where to look.
 
I keep thinking of Veronica Geng’s hilarious story which includes the line:

<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.

<p>Introduction: José Iparraguirre writes:
  
I’ve read  a recent paper  by the International Monetary Fund on the effects of fiscal consolidation measures on income inequality (Fiscal Monitor October 2012, Appendix 1).


They run a panel regression with 48 countries and 30 years (annual data) of a measure of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on a number of covariates, including a measure of fiscal consolidation.


Footnote 39 (page 51) informs that they’ve employed seemingly unrelated regression and panel-corrected standard errors, and that to double-check they’ve also run ordinary least squares and fixed-effects panel regressions—all with similar results.


So far, so good. However, the footnote goes on to explain that “Some of the results (e.g. the causal relationship between consolidation and inequality) may be subject to endogeneity and should be interpreted with caution”. (Italics are mine).


Therefore, it seems that the crux of the exercise—i.e. estimating the relationship between fiscal con</p><p>5 0.89219588 <a title="2338-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-06-Bayesian_Anova_found_useful_in_ecology.html">1102 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-06-Bayesian Anova found useful in ecology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David LeBauer points me to  this article  in PLoS One by Andy Hector, Thomas Bell, Yann Hautier, Forest Isbell, Marc Kéry, Peter Reich, Jasper van Ruijven, and Bernhard Schmid.  Here’s the abstract:
  
The idea that species diversity can influence ecosystem functioning has been controversial and its importance relative to compositional effects hotly debated. Unfortunately, assessing the relative importance of different explanatory variables in complex linear models is not simple. In this paper we assess the relative importance of species richness and species composition in a multilevel model analysis of net aboveground biomass production in grassland biodiversity experiments by estimating variance components for all explanatory variables. We compare the variance components using  a recently introduced graphical Bayesian ANOVA  [emphasis added]. We show that while the use of test statistics and the R2 gives contradictory assessments, the variance components analysis reveals that species</p><p>6 0.88953996 <a title="2338-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-Piss-poor_monocausal_social_science.html">1196 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-Piss-poor monocausal social science</a></p>

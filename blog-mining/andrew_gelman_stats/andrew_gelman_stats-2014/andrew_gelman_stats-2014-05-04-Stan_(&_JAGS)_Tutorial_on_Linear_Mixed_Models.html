<p>Introduction: Martyn Plummer , the creator of the open-source, C++, graphical-model compiler  JAGS  (aka “Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), runs a forum on the JAGS site that has a very similar feel to the mail-bag posts on this blog.  Martyn answers general statistical computing questions (e.g., why slice sampling rather than Metropolis-Hastings?) and general modeling (e.g., why won’t my model converge with this prior?).
 
Here’s the link to the top-level JAGS site, and to the forum:

The forum’s pretty active, with the stats page showing hundreds of views per day and very regular posts and answers.  Martyn’s last post was today.
 
Martyn also has a blog devoted to JAGS and other stats news:

I read your  post  the other day [now the other month, as our blog is on a bit of a delay] on helping psychologists do research and thought you might be interested in our R package, “bootES”, for robust effect size calculation and confidence interval estimation using resampling techniques. The package provides one function, ‘bootES’, that makes a variety of effect size calculations fairly straightforward for researchers with limited programming experience.  The majority of the implemented are not available in R or SPSS without custom coding. Kris Kirby (Williams College) and I have published a paper in Behavioral Research Methods describing the methods and providing a tutorial on use of the package: http://bit.ly/YIM6VD. We hope that it’s useful to psychologists and other social science researchers!
  
I haven’t tried this out but it might be of interest for some of you.</p><p>4 0.15755974 <a title="2318-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic%21.html">1580 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic!</a></p>

I’ve been translating a few ongoing data analysis projects into  Stan  code, mostly with success. The most important for me right now has been a hierarchical zero-inflated gamma problem. This a “hurdle” model, in which a bernoulli GLM produces zeros/nonzeros, and then a gamma GLM produces the nonzero values, using varying effects correlated with those in the bernoulli process.


The data are 20 years of human foraging returns from a subsistence hunting population in Paraguay (the Ache), comprising about 15k hunts in total (Hill & Kintigh. 2009. Current Anthropology 50:369-377). Observed values are kilograms of meat returned to camp. The more complex models contain a 147-by-9 matrix of varying effects (147 unique hunters), as well as imputation of missing values.


Originally, I had written the sampler myself in raw R code. It was very slow, but I knew what it was doing at least.

<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.

<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>4 0.87446368 <a title="2318-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-13-CmdStan%2C_RStan%2C_PyStan_v2.2.0.html">2209 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-13-CmdStan, RStan, PyStan v2.2.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you need an excuse to go skiing in Tahoe next month, our paper on Stan as a probabilistic programming language was accepted for:
  
  Workshop on Probabilistic Programming  
NIPS 2012 
7–8 December, 2012, Lake Tahoe, Nevada
   
The workshop is organized by the folks behind the probabilistic programming language  Church  and has a great lineup of invited speakers (Chris Bishop, Josh Tennenbaum, and Stuart Russell).  And in case you’re interested in the main conference, here’s the list of accepted  NIPS 2012 papers and posters .

<p>Introduction: Shravan Vasishth sent me an earlier draft of this tutorial he co-authored with Tanner Sorensen.  I liked it, asked if I could blog about it, and in response, they’ve put together a convenient web page with links to the tutorial PDF, JAGS and Stan programs, and data:
 
 Fitting linear mixed models using JAGS and Stan: A tutorial 
 
The tutorial’s aimed at psycholinguists in particular and cognitive psychologists more generally, but it’s clear enough to be understood by anyone.  Plus, the psycholinguistic data is a lot of fun.
 
There’s contact info on the tutorial itself if you want to send the authors feedback directly.
 
I have to say I’m very psyched to see other people writing tutorials for Stan for particular application areas of interest.</p><p>2 0.84599519 <a title="2318-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-What_are_the_standards_for_reliability_in_experimental_psychology%3F.html">1101 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-What are the standards for reliability in experimental psychology?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An experimental psychologist was wondering about the standards in that field for “acceptable reliability” (when looking at inter-rater reliability in coding data).  He wondered, for example, if some variation on signal detectability theory might be applied to adjust for inter-rater differences in criteria for saying some code is present.
 
What about Cohen’s kappa?  The psychologist wrote:
  
Cohen’s kappa does adjust for “guessing,” but its assumptions are not well motivated, perhaps not any more than adjustments for guessing versus the application of signal detectability theory where that can be applied. But one can’t do a straightforward application of signal detectability theory for reliability in that you don’t know whether the signal is present or not.
  
I think measurement issues are important but I don’t have enough experience in this area to answer the question without knowing more about the problem that this researcher is working on.

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>4 0.81383777 <a title="2318-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-16-%E2%80%9CReal_data_can_be_a_pain%E2%80%9D.html">1460 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-16-“Real data can be a pain”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael McLaughlin sent me the following query with the above title.
  
Some time ago, I [McLaughlin] was handed a dataset that needed to be modeled.  It was generated as follows:


1. Random navigation errors, historically a binary mixture of normal and Laplace with a common mean, were collected by observation.


2. Sadly, these data were recorded with too few decimal places so that the resulting quantization is clearly visible in a scatterplot.


3. The quantized data were then interpolated (to an unobserved location).


The final result looks like fuzzy points (small scale jitter) at quantized intervals spanning a much larger scale (the parent mixture distribution).  This fuzziness, likely ~normal or ~Laplace, results from the interpolation.  Otherwise, the data would look like a discrete analogue of the normal/Laplace mixture.


I would like to characterize the latent normal/Laplace mixture distribution but the quantization is “getting in the way”.  When I tried MCMC on this proble</p><p>5 0.80961919 <a title="2318-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-06-One_reason_New_York_isn%E2%80%99t_as_rich_as_it_used_to_be%3A__Redistribution_of_federal_tax_money_to_other_states.html">1485 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-06-One reason New York isn’t as rich as it used to be:  Redistribution of federal tax money to other states</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>6 0.80831802 <a title="2318-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-A_defense_of_Tom_Wolfe_based_on_the_impossibility_of_the_law_of_small_numbers_in_network_structure.html">1615 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-A defense of Tom Wolfe based on the impossibility of the law of small numbers in network structure</a></p>

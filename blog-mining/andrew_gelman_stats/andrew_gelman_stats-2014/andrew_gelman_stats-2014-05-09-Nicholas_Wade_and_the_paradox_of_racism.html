I’ve been thinking about this for a few months ever since receiving in the mail a new book, “A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human History,” by New York Times reporter Nicholas Wade.
 
Here’s what I wrote in my review of this book  for Slate :
  
The word “inequality” does not appear in the book’s index, but what Wade is offering is essentially a theory of economic and social inequality, explaining systematic racial differences in prosperity based on a combination of innate traits (“the disinclination to save in tribal societies is linked to a strong propensity for immediate consumption”) and genetic adaptation to political and social institutions (arguing, for example, that generations of centralized rule have effected a selection pressure for Chinese to be accepting of authority).

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . .

<p>Introduction: Here’s a pretty funny example of silly statistics, caught by  Lisa Wade :
 
 A study  published in 2001 . . . asked undergraduate college students their favorite color and presented the results by sex.  Men’s favorites are on the left, women’s on the right:
 
 
 
The authors of the study, Lee Ellis and Christopher Ficek, wrote:
  
We are inclined to suspect the involvement of neurohormonal factors. Studies of rats have found average sex differences in the number of neurons comprising various parts of the visual cortex. Also, gender differences have been found in rat preferences for the amount of sweetness in drinking water. One experiment demonstrated that the sex differences in rat preferences for sweetness was eliminated by depriving males of male-typical testosterone levels in utero. Perhaps, prenatal exposure to testosterone and other sex hormones operates in a similar way to “bias” preferences for certain colors in humans.
  
As Wade points out, that all seems a bit ridiculous giv</p><p>4 0.12137021 <a title="2327-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-12-Steven_Pinker%E2%80%99s_unconvincing_debunking_of_group_selection.html">1414 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-12-Steven Pinker’s unconvincing debunking of group selection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>5 0.11381961 <a title="2327-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.
  
I  disagreed , saying that Christakis wasn’t giving social science research enough credit:
  
I’m no economist so I can let others discuss the bit about “monopoly power is bad for markets.” I assume that the study by</p><p>6 0.11019994 <a title="2327-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Further_thoughts_on_happiness_and_life_satisfaction_research.html">98 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Further thoughts on happiness and life satisfaction research</a></p>

Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>3 0.84135878 <a title="2327-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-29-Auto-Gladwell%2C_or_Can_fractals_be_used_to_predict_human_history%3F.html">11 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-29-Auto-Gladwell, or Can fractals be used to predict human history?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just reviewed the book Bursts, by Albert-László Barabási, for Physics Today.  But I had a lot more to say that couldn’t fit into the magazine’s 800-word limit.  Here I’ll reproduce what I sent to Physics Today, followed by my additional thoughts.
  
The back cover of Bursts book promises “a revolutionary new theory showing how we can predict human behavior.”  I wasn’t fully convinced on that score, but the book does offer a well-written and thought-provoking window into author Albert-László Barabási’s research in power laws and network theory.


Power laws–the mathematical pattern that little things are common and large things are rare–have been observed in many different domains, including incomes (as noted by economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth century), word frequencies (as noted by linguist George Zipf), city sizes, earthquakes, and virtually anything else that can be measured.

<p>Introduction: About 15 years ago I ran across this book and read it, just for fun.  Rhoads is a (nonquantitative) political scientist and he’s writing about basic economic concepts such as opportunity cost, marginalism, and economic incentives.  As he puts it, “welfare economics is concerned with anything any individual values enough to be willing to give something up for it.”
 
The first two-thirds of the book is all about the “economist’s view” (personally, I’d prefer to see it called the “quantitative view”) of the world and how it applies to policy issues.  The quick message, which I think is more generally accepted now than in the 1970s when Rhoads started working on this book, is that free-market processes can do better than governmental rules in allocating resources.  Certain ideas that are obvious to quantitative people–for example, we want to reduce pollution and reduce the incentives to pollute, but it does not make sense to try to get the level of a pollutant all the way down to zero if t</p><p>5 0.8338902 <a title="2327-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-12-Steven_Pinker%E2%80%99s_unconvincing_debunking_of_group_selection.html">1414 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-12-Steven Pinker’s unconvincing debunking of group selection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>6 0.80081034 <a title="2327-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-08-The_politics_of_economic_and_statistical_models.html">1204 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-08-The politics of economic and statistical models</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The paradox of racism is that at any given moment, the racism of the day seems reasonable and very possibly true, but the racism of the past always seems so ridiculous. 
   
I’ve been thinking about this for a few months ever since receiving in the mail a new book, “A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human History,” by New York Times reporter Nicholas Wade.
 
Here’s what I wrote in my review of this book  for Slate :
  
The word “inequality” does not appear in the book’s index, but what Wade is offering is essentially a theory of economic and social inequality, explaining systematic racial differences in prosperity based on a combination of innate traits (“the disinclination to save in tribal societies is linked to a strong propensity for immediate consumption”) and genetic adaptation to political and social institutions (arguing, for example, that generations of centralized rule have effected a selection pressure for Chinese to be accepting of authority).

<p>Introduction: Ta-Nehisi Coates recently published  a fascinating column  on the “culture of poverty,” in particular focusing on the idea that behavior that is rational and adaptive in some settings is not so appropriate in others:
  
The set of practices required for a young man to secure his safety on the streets of his troubled neighborhood are not the same as those required to place him on an honor roll . . . The way to guide him through this transition is not to insult his native language. . . .


For black men like us, the feeling of having something to lose, beyond honor and face, is foreign. We grew up in communities—New York, Baltimore, Chicago—where the Code of the Streets was the first code we learned. Respect and reputation are everything there. These values are often denigrated by people who have never been punched in the face. But when you live around violence there is no opting out. A reputation for meeting violence with violence is a shield. That protection increases when you are part</p><p>3 0.97289819 <a title="2327-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating_evidence_from_published_research.html">2006 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating evidence from published research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on my  entry  the other day on post-publication peer review, Dan Kahan writes:
  
You give me credit, I think, for merely participating in what I think is a systemic effect in the practice of empirical inquiry that conduces to quality control & hence the advance of knowledge by such means (likely the title conveys that!).  I’d say:


(a) by far the greatest weakness in the “publication regime” in social sciences today is the systematic disregard for basic principles of valid causal inference, a deficiency either in comprehension or craft that is at the root of scholars’ resort to (and journals’ tolerance for) invalid samples, the employment of designs that don’t generate observations more consistent with a hypothesis than with myriad rival ones, and the resort to deficient statistical modes of analysis that treat detection of “statististically significant difference” rather than “practical corroboration of practical meaningful effect” as the goal of such analysis (especial</p><p>4 0.97257751 <a title="2327-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-01-So_many_topics%2C_so_little_time.html">641 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-01-So many topics, so little time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As many of you know, this blog is on an approximate one-month delay.  I schedule my posts to appear roughly once a day, and there’s currently a backlog of about 20 or 30 posts.
 
Recently I’ve decided to spend less time blogging, but I have some ideas I’d still like to share.  To tweet, if you will.  So I thought I’d just put a bunch of ideas out there that interested readers could follow up on.  Think of it like one of those old-style dot-dot-dot newspaper columns.
  

 
- One thing statisticians could learn from economists:  if you want to control for a continuous variable, throw it in as a fifth-order polynomial on the right hand side of a regression.  A lot of statisticians will either do simple linear or else spaz out with a spline.  But good old polynomials are fine.
 
- One thing that not so many political scientists realize is that nowadays the rich voters are Democrats!  You don’t always see that in surveys, but remember that survey nonresponse rates are typically 80%+.  Heck,</p><p>5 0.97239232 <a title="2327-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-12-Sometimes_a_graph_really_is_just_ugly.html">798 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-12-Sometimes a graph really is just ugly</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been talking a lot about how different graphical presentations serve different goals, and how we should avoid being so judgmental about graphs.  Instead of saying that a particular data visualization is bad, we should think about what goal it serves.
 
That’s all well and good, but sometimes a graph really is bad.
 
Let me draw an analogy to the popular media.  Books and videogames serve different goals.  I’m a reader and writer of books and have very little interest in videogames, but it would be silly for me to criticize a videogame on the grounds that it’s a bad book (or, for that matter, to criticize a book because it doesn’t yield a satisfying game-playing experience).  But . . . there are bad books and there are bad videogames.
 
To restrict our scope to books for a moment:  you could argue that Mickey Spillane’s books are terrible or you could argue that, given that they sold tens of millions of copies, they must have had something going for them.

A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.

<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Our statistics book made it possible for Kruschke to write his excellent book for psycholo</p><p>3 0.22731262 <a title="2236-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?

<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class.

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.  I likened their paper to other work which I considered flawed for multiple comparisons (too many researcher degrees of freedom), including a claimed relation bet</p><p>5 0.18119757 <a title="2236-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-06-How_much_time_%28if_any%29_should_we_spend_criticizing_research_that%E2%80%99s_fraudulent%2C_crappy%2C_or_just_plain_pointless%3F.html">2235 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-06-How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a brief email exchange with Jeff Leek regarding our recent  discussions  of replication, criticism, and the self-correcting process of science.
 
Jeff writes:
  
(1) I can see the problem with serious, evidence-based criticisms not being published in the same journal (and linked to) studies that are shown to be incorrect. I have been mostly seeing these sorts of things show up in blogs. But I’m not sure that is a bad thing. I think people read blogs more than they read the literature. I wonder if this means that blogs will eventually be a sort of “shadow literature”? 


(2) I think there is a ton of bad literature out there, just like there is a ton of bad stuff on Google. If we focus too much on the bad stuff we will be paralyzed. I still manage to find good papers despite all the bad papers. 


(3) I think one positive solution to this problem is to incentivize/publish referee reports and give people credit for a good referee report just like they get credit for a good paper.

Unless I missed it, you haven’t commented on the recent  article  of Michael Bang Peterson [with Daniel Sznycer, Aaron Sell, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby].  It seems to have been reviewed extensively in the lay press.  A typical example is  here .  This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

<p>Introduction: Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall, authors of  that paper  that claimed that women at peak fertility were more likely to wear red or pink shirts (see further discussion  here  and  here ), and then a later paper that claimed that this happens in some weather but not others, just informed me that they have posted a note in disagreement with an paper by Eric Loken and myself.
 
Our paper is unpublished, but I do have the megaphone of this blog, and Tracy and Beall do not, so I think it’s only fair to link to their note right away.  I’ll quote from their note (but if you’re interested,  please follow the link and read the whole thing ) and then give some background and my own reaction.

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.  For example, “Study 1 indicates that ovul</p><p>2 0.98759836 <a title="2236-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-04-The_Notorious_N.H.S.T._presents%3A__Mo_P-values_Mo_Problems.html">2281 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-04-The Notorious N.H.S.T. presents:  Mo P-values Mo Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.
 
 Fernando:   Incentives? Impact factors? Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . .

<p>Introduction: We had a  discussion  the other day of a paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change,” by economist Richard Tol.
 
The paper came to my attention after I saw a  notice  from Adam Marcus that it was recently revised because of data errors.  But after looking at the paper more carefully, I see a bunch of other problems that, to me, make the whole analysis close to useless as it stands.
 
I think this is worth discussing because the paper has been somewhat influential (so far cited 328 times, according to Google Scholar) and has even been cited in the  popular press  as evidence that “Climate change has done more good than harm so far and is likely to continue doing so for most of this century . . . There are many likely effects of climate change: positive and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial. And if you aggregate them all, the overall effect is positive today — and likely to stay positive until around 2080. That was the conclusion of Professor Richard Tol</p><p>4 0.98630595 <a title="2236-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-How_can_statisticians_help_psychologists_do_their_research_better%3F.html">1860 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-How can statisticians help psychologists do their research better?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Our statistics book made it possible for Kruschke to write his excellent book for psycholo</p><p>5 0.98542118 <a title="2236-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-03-The_statistical_properties_of_smart_chains_%28and_referral_chains_more_generally%29.html">1882 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-03-The statistical properties of smart chains (and referral chains more generally)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Louis Mittel writes:
  
The premise of  the column  this guy is starting is interesting:  Noah Davis interviews a smart person and then interviews the smartest person that smart person knows and so on. 


It reminded me of you mentioning survey design strategy of asking people about other people, like “How many people do you know named Stuart?” or “How many people do you know that have had an abortion?”


Ignoring the interview aspect of what this guy is doing, I think there’s some cool questions about the distribution/path behavior of smartest-person-I-know chains (say, seeded at random).  Do they loop?  If so, how long do they run before looping, how large are the loops?  What parts of the population do the explore?  Do you know of anything that’s been done on something like this?
  
My reply:  Interesting question.  It could be asked of any referral chain, for example asking a sequence of people, “Who’s the tallest person you know?” or “Who’s the best piano player you know” or “Who’</p><p>6 0.98503858 <a title="2236-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Still_more_Mr._P_in_public_health.html">770 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Still more Mr. P in public health</a></p>

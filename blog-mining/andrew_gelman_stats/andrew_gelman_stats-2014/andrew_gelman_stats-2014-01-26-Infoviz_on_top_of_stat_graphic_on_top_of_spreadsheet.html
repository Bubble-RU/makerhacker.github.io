This chart is unreadable. It also fails the self-sufficiency test. All 13 data points are printed onto the chart. You really don’t need the axis, and the gridlines.


A further design flaw is the use of signposts. Our eyes are drawn to the hexagons containing the brand icons but the data is at the other end of the signpost, where it is planted on the surface!

Kaiser writes:
  
What they did right:


- Did not put the data on a map 
- Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically 
- Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel 
- Only used three labels for the 11 years on the plot 
- Did not overdo the vertical scale either


The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go. I would have used smaller fonts throughout.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s comments. I could even add a few more, like using light gray for the backgrounds and a bright blue for the lines, spacing the graphs well, using full country names rather than three-letter abbreviations. There are so many standard mistakes that go into default data displays that it is refreshing to see a simple graph done</p><p>4 0.21749753 <a title="2186-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-Three_hours_in_the_life_of_a_statistician.html">1001 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-Three hours in the life of a statistician</a></p>

Kaiser Fung has a  synopsis .


As if you don’t have enough to do, I thought you might be interested in blogging on this.
  
My reply:
 
I thought Kaiser’s discussion was good, especially this point:
  
Effect on treatment group = Effect of the drug + effect of belief in being treated


Effect on placebo group = Effect of belief in being treated


Thus, the difference between the two groups = effect of the drug, since the effect of belief in being treated affects both groups of patients.
  
Thus, as Kaiser puts it, if the treatment isn’t doing better than placebo, it doesn’t say that the placebo effect is big (let alone “too big”) but that the treatment isn’t showing any additional effect.  It’s “treatment + placebo” vs. placebo, not treatment vs. placebo.
 
That said, I’d prefer for Kaiser to make it clear that the additivity he’s assu</p><p>6 0.20376019 <a title="2186-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-NYT_shills_for_personal_DNA_tests.html">543 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-NYT shills for personal DNA tests</a></p>

What makes the designer want to tilt the reader’s head?


This chart is unreadable. It also fails the self-sufficiency test. All 13 data points are printed onto the chart. You really don’t need the axis, and the gridlines.


A further design flaw is the use of signposts. Our eyes are drawn to the hexagons containing the brand icons but the data is at the other end of the signpost, where it is planted on the surface!


Here is a sketch of something not as cute:


 


I [Kaiser] expressed time as years . . . The mobile-related entities are labelled red. The dots could be replaced by the hexagonal brand icons.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s criticisms, and I agree that his graph is, from the statistical perspective, a zillion times better than what was published. On the other hand, unusual images can get attention. Recall the famous/notorious clock plot from  Florence Nightingale .

By nearly all accounts, the Republicans looks set to take over the US House of Representatives in next week’s November 2010 general election. . . . Republicans, in this wave election that recalls 1994, look set to win not just swing districts, but also those districts that have been traditionally Democratic, or those with strong or longtime Democratic incumbents. Naturally, just as in 2008, this has led to overclaiming by jubilant conservatives and distraught liberals-though the adjectives were then reversed-that this portends a realignment in American politics. . . .


Republican moderates in Congress are often associated with two factors: 1) a liberal voting record earlier in their career, and 2) a liberal district. Of course, both are related, in the sense that ambitious moderates choose liberal districts to run in, and liberal districts weed out conservative candidates. . . . Given how competitive Republicans are in 2010, even in otherwise unfriendly territory,</p><p>3 0.86525738 <a title="2186-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . .

Data are from Wave II of the National Survey of Families and Households published in 1996, interviews from 1992-1994.


The division of labor:


 Core tasks include preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning house, shopping, and washing and ironing; non-core tasks include outdoor work, paying bills, auto maintenance, and driving. 


As you can see in the graph, the more of the “core” tasks a man completes, the less sex he gets.


The covariates for overall marital happiness and specific happiness with spouses’ contribution to housework did not change this relationship. The covariate for gender-traditional ideology on household labor likewise</p><p>5 0.86326492 <a title="2186-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-14-A_model_rejection_letter.html">1118 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-14-A model rejection letter</a></p>

It is no inconsiderable degree of reluctance that I decline the offer of any Paper from you. I think, however, you will upon reconsideration of the subject be of the opinion that I have no other alternative. The subjects you propose for a series of Mathematical and Metaphysical Essays are so profound, that there is perhaps not a single subscriber to our Journal who could follow them.

</p><p>10 - No need to cram all information onto a single graph. [sent-18, score-0.085]
</p><p>11 - A related point:  Make each graph small, then you can put lots of graphs on a page (or screen)   - A tradeoff:  clarity, recognized graphical forms (time series, scatterplot, etc), and spare (Tufte or Cleveland-like) design make a graph easier to read. [sent-20, score-1.096]

I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>4 0.23584959 <a title="2266-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>5 0.21773897 <a title="2266-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-31-A_data_visualization_manifesto.html">61 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-31-A data visualization manifesto</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.  It represents neither a dat</p><p>4 0.84918725 <a title="2266-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-05-The_Grinch_Comes_Back.html">1606 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-05-The Grinch Comes Back</a></p>

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.  A graph in a journal such as Science or Nature is meant to grab the eye of a busy reader (or to go viral on</p><p>5 0.8409515 <a title="2266-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>6 0.83642244 <a title="2266-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-01-A_book_with_a_bunch_of_simple_graphs.html">1439 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-01-A book with a bunch of simple graphs</a></p>

Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

<p>Introduction: More and more I’m thinking that line plots are great.  More specifically, two-way grids of line plots on common scales, with one, two, or three lines per plot (enough to show comparisons but not so many that you can’t tell the lines apart).  Also dot plots, of the sort that have been masterfully used by Lax and Phillips to show comparisons and trends in support for gay rights.
 
There’s a big step missing, though, and that is to be able to make these graphs as a default.  We have to figure out the right way to structure the data so these graphs come naturally.
 
Then when it’s all working, we can talk the Excel people into implementing our ideas.  I’m not asking to be paid here; all our ideas are in the public domain and I’m happy for Microsoft or Google or whoever to copy us.

What they did right:


- Did not put the data on a map 
- Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically 
- Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel 
- Only used three labels for the 11 years on the plot 
- Did not overdo the vertical scale either


The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go. I would have used smaller fonts throughout.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s comments. I could even add a few more, like using light gray for the backgrounds and a bright blue for the lines, spacing the graphs well, using full country names rather than three-letter abbreviations. There are so many standard mistakes that go into default data displays that it is refreshing to see a simple graph done</p><p>4 0.9658711 <a title="2266-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-17-Is_chartjunk_really_%E2%80%9Cmore_useful%E2%80%9D_than_plain_graphs%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_so..html">37 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-17-Is chartjunk really “more useful” than plain graphs?

<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>6 0.96324122 <a title="2266-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-07-X_on_JLP.html">1792 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-07-X on JLP</a></p>

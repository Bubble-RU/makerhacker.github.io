<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.
 
Robin Hanson happens not to use much slang and he uses this trait to define himself, not quite to stand out in the crowd but to put himself on one end of a scale.

<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>5 0.11243706 <a title="2329-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-02-Classification_error.html">1745 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-02-Classification error</a></p>

Every once in awhile I [Thoma] kind of need a bit of a break . . . I ran out of energy a few weeks ago . . . I’ll do my best until then, daily links at least somehow and short “echo” posts as usual, but I doubt I’ll have time to say much myself . . . [There's a reason I haven't missed a day posting to the blog in over eight years. When I first started, I was afraid that if I missed a day new readers would bail out . . . I realize a missed day won't kill the blog at this point, but it's still important to me to keep posting every day.]
  
What I do is post once a day; when I write new posts, I schedule them for the future.  I currently have approx 2-month lag.  Sometimes I post 2 or 3 times in one day, if I have something topical or just something I feel like posting on.  Overall, though, I find a benefit to the lag.

<p>Introduction: Three different people have pointed me to  this post  by Ken Regan on statistical evaluation of claims of cheating in chess.  So I figured I have to satisfy demand and post something on this.  But I have nothing to say.  All these topics interest me, but I somehow had difficulty reading through the entire post.  I scanned through but what I really wanted to see was some data.  Show me a scatterplot, then I’ll get interested.
 
P.S.  This is meant as no disparagement of Regan or his blog.

<p>Introduction: Basbøll  writes :
  
I [Basbøll] have got to come up with forty things to say [in the next few months]. . . .


What would you like me to write about?  I’ll of course be writing quite a bit about what I’m now calling “article design”, i.e., how to map out the roughly forty paragraphs that a journal article is composed of. And I’ll also be talking about how to plan the writing process that is to produce those paragraphs. The basic principle is still to write at least one paragraph a day in 27 minutes. (You can adapt this is various ways to your own taste; some like 18-minute or even 13-minute paragraphs.)


But I’d like to talk about questions of style, too, and even a little bit about epistemology. “Knowledge—academic knowledge, that is—is the ability to compose a coherent prose paragraph about something in 27 minutes,” I always say. I’d like to reflect a little more about what this conception of knowledge really means. This means I’ll have to walk back my recent dismissal of epistemol</p><p>5 0.79959142 <a title="2329-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-07-Not_much_difference_between_communicating_to_self_and_communicating_to_others.html">1408 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-07-Not much difference between communicating to self and communicating to others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
[Advertising executive] Russell Davies wrote a  blog post  called “The Tyranny of the Big Idea”. His five-point procedure begins:

 
Start doing stuff. Start executing things which seem right. Do it quickly and do it often. Don’t cling onto anything, good or bad. Don’t repeat much. Take what was good and do it differently.
 

And ends with: “And something else and something else.”
  
This inspires several thoughts, which I’ll take advantage of the blog format to present with no attempt to be cohesively organized.
 
1.  My first concern is the extent to which productivity-enhancing advice such as Davies’s (and Basbøll’s) is zero or even  negative-sum , just helping people in the rat race.  But, upon reflection, I’d rate the recommendations as positive-sum.  If people learn to write better and be more productive, that’s not (necessarily) just positional.
 
2.  Blogging fits with the “Do it quickly and do it often” advice.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  quotes  Robin Hanson:
  
If your main reason for talking is to socialize, you’ll want to talk about whatever everyone else is talking about. Like say the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. But if instead your purpose is to gain and spread useful insight, so that we can all understand more about things that matter, you’ll want to look for relatively neglected topics. . . .
  
One advantage of having this blog on a lag of a month or two is that I can post things, knowing that when my discussion finally appears, it will no longer be topical.  Indeed, this post is an example.</p><p>2 0.93734246 <a title="2329-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-17-Joanne_Gowa_scooped_me_by_22_years_in_my_criticism_of_Axelrod%E2%80%99s_Evolution_of_Cooperation.html">348 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-17-Joanne Gowa scooped me by 22 years in my criticism of Axelrod’s Evolution of Cooperation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.  I commented as follows:
  
Read between the lines. The paper originally was released in 2009 and was published in 2013 in PLOS-One, which is one step above appearing on Arxiv. PLOS-One publishes some good things (so does Arxiv) but it’s the place</p><p>4 0.93026364 <a title="2329-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-13-Win_%245000_in_the_Economist%E2%80%99s_data_visualization_competition.html">1495 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-13-Win $5000 in the Economist’s data visualization competition</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Our apartment is from earlier in the century, so I can’t give Tyler Cowen’s  first answer , but, after that, I follow him in thinking of the several books I have from that decade.  Beyond that, lemme think . . . We occasionally play  Risk , and our set dates from the 50s.  Some kitchen implements (a mixmaster, a couple of cookbooks, who knows which old bowls, forks, etc).  Probably some of the furniture, although I don’t know which.  Probably some of the items in our building (the boiler?)  What else, I wonder?  There are probably a few things I’m forgetting.
 
50-60 years is a long time, I guess.
 
P.S. to the commenters:  I’m taking the question to refer to things manufactured  in  the 1950s and not before!</p><p>6 0.92876697 <a title="2329-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-14-The_tabloids_strike_again.html">1168 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-14-The tabloids strike again</a></p>

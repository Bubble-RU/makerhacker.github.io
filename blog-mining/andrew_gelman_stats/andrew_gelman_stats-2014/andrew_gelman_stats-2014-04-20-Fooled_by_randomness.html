 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

<p>Introduction: I recently had the occasion to reread  my review  of The Black Swan, from April 2007.
 
It was fun reading my review (and also  this pre-review ; “nothing useful escapes from a blackbody,” indeed).  It was like a greatest hits of all my pet ideas that I’ve never published.
 
Looking back, I realize that Taleb really was right about a lot of things.  Now that the financial crisis has happened, we tend to forget that the experts who Taleb bashes were  not  always reasonable at all.  Here’s what I wrote in my review, three and a half years ago:
  
On page 19, Taleb refers to the usual investment strategy (which I suppose I actually use myself) as “picking pennies in front of a steamroller.” That’s a cute phrase; did he come up with it? I’m also reminded of the famous Martingale betting system. Several years ago in a university library I came across a charming book by Maxim (of gun fame) where he went through chapter after chapter demolishing the Martingale system.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there.  As I  wrote  a couple years ago, it’s usually presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
For example, Nassim Taleb has a  webpage  that includes a bunch of one-line bits of advice (scroll to item 132 on the linked page).  Here’s his final piece of advice:
  
If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.
  
I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.  I’ve been in environments where people follow Taleb’s advice, saying nothing and occasionally trying to “eliminate” people, and it’s not pretty.  I much prefer for people to be open</p><p>4 0.17704812 <a title="2297-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-19-Everything_is_Obvious_%28once_you_know_the_answer%29.html">719 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-19-Everything is Obvious (once you know the answer)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.  When learning science, we sometimes speak</p><p>5 0.14649287 <a title="2297-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-15-Swiss_Jonah_Lehrer_update.html">2024 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-15-Swiss Jonah Lehrer update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From Anthony Burgess’s review of “The Batsford Companion to Popular Literature,” by Victor Neuberg:
  
Arthur J. Burks (1898-1974) was no gentleman.  During the 1930s, when he would sometimes have nearly two million words in current publication, he aimed at producing 18,000 words a day.

 
Editors would call me up and ask me to do a novelette by the next afternoon, and I would, but it nearly killed me. . . .  I once appeared on the covers of eleven magazines the same month, and then almost killed myself for years trying to make it twelve.  I never did.
 

[Masanao:   I think you know where I'm heading with that story.]


Ursula Bloom, born 1985 and still with us [this was written sometime between 1978 and 1985], is clearly no lady.  Writing also under the pseudonyms of Lozania Prole (there’s an honest name for you), Sheila Burnes and Mary Essex, she has produced 486 boooks, beginning with  Tiger  at the age of seven. . . .


Was Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace (1875-1932) a gentleman? .</p><p>4 0.8281827 <a title="2297-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.

<p>Introduction: I just reviewed the book Bursts, by Albert-László Barabási, for Physics Today.  But I had a lot more to say that couldn’t fit into the magazine’s 800-word limit.  Here I’ll reproduce what I sent to Physics Today, followed by my additional thoughts.
  
The back cover of Bursts book promises “a revolutionary new theory showing how we can predict human behavior.”  I wasn’t fully convinced on that score, but the book does offer a well-written and thought-provoking window into author Albert-László Barabási’s research in power laws and network theory.


Power laws–the mathematical pattern that little things are common and large things are rare–have been observed in many different domains, including incomes (as noted by economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth century), word frequencies (as noted by linguist George Zipf), city sizes, earthquakes, and virtually anything else that can be measured.  In the mid-twentieth century, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot devoted an influential caree</p><p>6 0.81865579 <a title="2297-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-19-Everything_is_Obvious_%28once_you_know_the_answer%29.html">719 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-19-Everything is Obvious (once you know the answer)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

<p>Introduction: Christian points me to  this  amusing story by Jonah Lehrer about Mohan Srivastava, (perhaps the same person as R. Mohan Srivastava, coauthor of a book called Applied Geostatistics) who discovered a flaw in a scratch-off game in which he could figure out which tickets were likely to win based on partial information visible on the ticket.  It appears that scratch-off lotteries elsewhere have similar flaws in their design.
 
The obvious question is, why doesn’t the lottery create the patterns on the tickets (including which “teaser” numbers to reveal) completely at random?  It shouldn’t be hard to design this so that zero information is supplied from the outside. in which case Srivastava’s trick would be impossible.
 
So why not put down the numbers randomly?  Lehrer quotes Srivastava as saying:
  
The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers. Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random</p><p>3 0.95965242 <a title="2297-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist_claims_that_modern_art_could_just_as_well_be_replaced_by_a_%E2%80%9Cpaint-throwing_chimp%E2%80%9D.html">1390 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist claims that modern art could just as well be replaced by a “paint-throwing chimp”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

I [Mulford] ran across  this blog post  and found myself questioning the relevance of the test used.


I’d think Chi-Square would be inappropriate for trying to measure significance of choice in the manner presented here; irrespective of the cute hamster.  Since this is a common test for marketers and website developers – I’d be interested in which techniques you might suggest?


For tests of this nature, I typically measure a variety of variables (image placement, size, type, page speed, “page feel” as expressed in a factor, etc) and use LOGIT, Cluster and possibly a simple Bayesian model to determine which variables were most significant (chosen). Pearson Chi-squared may be used to express relationships between variables and outcome but I’ve typically not used it to simply judge a 0/1 choice as statistically significant or not.

 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables).

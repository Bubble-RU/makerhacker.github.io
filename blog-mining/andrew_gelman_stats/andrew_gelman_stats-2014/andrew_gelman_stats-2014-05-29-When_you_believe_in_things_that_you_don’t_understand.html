<p>Introduction: A student in my intro class came by the other day with a lot of questions.  It soon became clear that he was confused about a lot of things, going back several weeks in the course.  What this means is that we did not do a good job of monitoring his performance earlier during the semester.  But the question now is:  what do do next?  I’ll sign the drop form any time during the semester, but he didn’t want to drop the class (the usual scheduling issues).  And he doesn’t want to get a C or a D.  He’s in big trouble and at this point is basically rolling the dice that he’ll do well enough on the final to eke out a B in the course.  (Yes, he goes to section meetings and office hours, and he even tried hiring a tutor.  But it’s tough–if you’ve already been going to class and still don’t know what’s going on, it’s not so easy to pull yourself out of the hole, even if you have a big pile of practice problems ahead of you.)

Wie oft aber derart knifflige Aufgaben im realen Leben auftauchen, könne er nicht sagen. Was fast schon beruhigend klingt.

<p>Introduction: Aki points us to  this discussion  from Rolf Zwaan:
  
The first massive replication project in psychology has just reached completion (several others are to follow). . . . What can we learn from the ManyLabs project? The results here show the effect sizes for the replication efforts (in green and grey) as well as the original studies (in blue). The 99% confidence intervals are for the meta-analysis of the effect size (the green dots); the studies are ordered by effect size.


 


Let’s first consider what we canNOT learn from these data. Of the 13 replication attempts (when the first four are taken together), 11 succeeded and 2 did not (in fact, at some point ManyLabs suggests that a third one, Imagined Contact also doesn’t really replicate). We cannot learn from this that the vast majority of psychological findings will replicate . . .


But even if we had an accurate estimate of the percentage of findings that replicate, how useful would that be?

<p>Introduction: I was just reading  an old post  and came across this example which I’d like to share with you again:
  
Here’s a story of R-squared = 1%. Consider a 0/1 outcome with about half the people in each category. For.example, half the people with some disease die in a year and half live. Now suppose there’s a treatment that increases survival rate from 50% to 60%. The unexplained sd is 0.5 and the explained sd is 0.05, hence R-squared is 0.01.</p><p>6 0.070741013 <a title="2352-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-19-%E2%80%9CThe_British_amateur_who_debunked_the_mathematics_of_happiness%E2%80%9D.html">2177 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-19-“The British amateur who debunked the mathematics of happiness”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: In response to the post  The bane of many causes  in the context of mobile phone use and brain cancer,  Robert Erikson  wrote:
  

The true control here is the side of the head of the tumor: same side as phone use or opposite side.   If that is the test, the data from the study are scary.  Clearly tumors are more likely on the “same” side, at whatever astronomical p value you want to use.   That cannot be explained away by misremembering, since an auxiliary study showed misremembering was not biased toward cell phone-tumor consistency.

  
A strong signal in the data pointed by Prof. Erikson is that the tumors are overwhelmingly likelier to appear on the same side of the head as where the phone is held. I’ve converted the ratios into percentages, based on an assumption that the risk for tumors would be apriori equal for both sides of the head.
 
 
 
There is a group of people with low-to-moderate exposure and high lateral bias, but the bias does increase quite smoothly with increasing</p><p>4 0.7521739 <a title="2352-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-28-Creating_a_Lenin-style_democracy.html">2270 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-28-Creating a Lenin-style democracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  explains  why a penalty for getting the wrong answer on a test (the SAT, which is used in college admissions and which is used in the  famous  8 schools example) is  not  a “penalty for guessing.”  Then the very next day he catches this from Todd Balf in the New York Times Magazine: 
  
  
Students were docked one-quarter point for every multiple-choice question they got wrong, requiring a time-consuming risk analysis to determine which questions to answer and which to leave blank.
  
Ugh!  That just makes me want to . . . ok, I won’t go there.  Anyway, Palko  goes to the trouble  to explain:
  
While time management for a test like the SAT can be complicated, the rule for guessing is embarrassingly simple: give your best guess for questions you read; don’t waste time guessing on questions that you didn’t have time to read.


The risk analysis actually becomes much more complicated when you take away the penalty for guessing. On the ACT (or the new SAT), there is a positive</p><p>5 0.75172639 <a title="2352-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-25-An_interesting_but_flawed_attempt_to_apply_general_forecasting_principles_to_contextualize_attitudes_toward_risks_of_global_warming.html">2112 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-25-An interesting but flawed attempt to apply general forecasting principles to contextualize attitudes toward risks of global warming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations.

<p>Introduction: Rolf Zwaan gives  an excellent discussion  of how  superstition  can arise and perpetuate itself:
  
A social-behavioral priming experiment is like rolling a 20-sided die, an icosahedron. If you roll the die a number of times, 20 will turn up at some point. Bingo! You have a significant effect. In fact, given what we now know about questionable and not so questionable research practices, it is fair to assume that the researchers are actually rolling with a 20-sided die where maybe as many as six sides have a 20 on them. So the chances of rolling a 20 are quite high.


Once the researchers have rolled a 20, their next interpretive move is to consider the circumstances that happened to coincide with rolling the die instrumental in producing the 20. The only problem is that they don’t know what those circumstances were. Was it the physical condition of the roller? Was it the weather? Was it the time of day? Was it the color of the roller’s sweater?

<p>Introduction: A colleague asks:
  
When I search the web, I find  the story  [of the article by Said, Wegman, et al. on social networks in climate research, which was recently bumped from the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis because of plagiarism] only on blogs, USA Today, and UPI.  Why is that?  Any idea why it isn’t reported by any of the major newspapers?
  
Here’s my answer:
 
1.  USA Today broke the story.  Apparently this USA Today reporter put a lot of effort into it.  The NYT doesn’t like to run a story that begins, “Yesterday, USA Today reported…”
 
2.  To us it’s big news because we’re statisticians.  [The main guy in the study, Edward Wegman, won the Founders Award from the American Statistical Association a few years ago.]  To the rest of the world, the story is:  “Obscure prof at an obscure college plagiarized an article in a journal that nobody’s ever heard of.”  When a Harvard scientist paints black dots on white mice and says he’s curing cancer, that’s news.  When P</p><p>5 0.87522894 <a title="2352-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-The_Conservative_States_of_America.html">636 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-The Conservative States of America</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After noting the increasing political conservatism of people in the poorer states, Richard Florida  writes :
  
The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism’s hold on America’s states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal.


Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward.


But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political. This ideological state of affairs advantages the policy preferences of poorer, less innovative states over wealthier, more innovative, and productive ones. American politics is increasingly disconnected from its economic engine.  And this deepening political divide has become pe</p><p>6 0.87475878 <a title="2352-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-08-Different_attitudes_about_parenting%2C_possibly_deriving_from_different_attitudes_about_self.html">564 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-08-Different attitudes about parenting, possibly deriving from different attitudes about self</a></p>

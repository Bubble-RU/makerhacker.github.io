 Little data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big-data world 
  
At the end of the day, after all the processing, big data are being used to answer little- data questions such as, Does an observed pattern generalize to the larger population?, or Could it be explained by alternative processes (sometimes called “chance”)? We discuss some recent ideas in the world of “little data” that remain of big importance.</p><p>4 0.16108523 <a title="2171-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Tenure-track_statistics_job_at_Teachers_College%2C_here_at_Columbia%21.html">361 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Tenure-track statistics job at Teachers College, here at Columbia!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: See below for the job announcement.  It’s for Teachers College, which is about 2 blocks from the statistics department and 2 blocks from the political science department.  So even though I don’t have any official connection with Teachers College (besides occasionally working with them on research projects), I very much would like to have another exciting young applied researcher here, to complement all the people we currently have in stat, poli sci, engineering, etc.  In particular, we have zillions of interesting and important social science research projects going on here, and they all need statistics work.  A lot of social scientists do statistics, but it’s not so easy to find a statistician who does serious social science research.
 
All this is to say that I hope this job gets some applicants from some people who are serious about applied statistics and the development of new models and methods.

Johns Hopkins University Post-Doctoral Fellow Opening


The Department of Mental Health invites applications for a post-doctoral research fellow in Statistical Methods for Mental Health Research, to be supervised by Dr. Elizabeth Stuart.  The successful applicant for this position will work on an NIH funded study to develop and evaluate propensity score methods when the covariates are measured with error, or when datasets contain similar, but not identical, measures of covariates of interest.  The post-doc will work with a team of researchers on development of new statistical methods, analysis of existing data, Monte Carlo simulations, and will take the lead on scientific publications.  Opportunities will be provided for training in causal inference, missing data, latent variable methods, the evaluation of statistical methods, and the application of statistics to mental health and education.  The three particular motivating examples will be: earl</p><p>2 0.93432158 <a title="2171-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-25-A_new_Bem_theory.html">1998 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-25-A new Bem theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I was talking with someone who knows Daryl Bem a bit, and he was sharing his thoughts on that  notorious  ESP paper that was published in a leading journal in the field but then was mocked, shot down, and was repeatedly replicated with no success.  My friend said that overall the Bem paper had positive effects in forcing psychologists to think more carefully about what sorts of research results should or should not be published in top journals, the role of replications, and other things.
 
I expressed agreement and shared my thought that, at some level, I don’t think Bem himself fully believes his ESP effects are real.  Why do I say this?  Because he seemed oddly content to publish results that were not quite conclusive.  He ran a bunch of experiments, looked at the data, and computed some post-hoc p-values in the .01 to .05 range.  If he really were confident that the phenomenon was real (that is, that the results would apply to new data), then he could’ve easily run the</p><p>3 0.91982245 <a title="2171-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-26-New_research_journal_on_observational_studies.html">2268 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-26-New research journal on observational studies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dylan Small writes:
  
I am starting an  observational studies journal  that aims to publish papers on all aspects of observational studies, including study protocols for observational studies, methodologies for observational studies, descriptions of data sets for observational studies, software for observational studies and analyses of observational studies.  One of the goals of the journal is to promote the planning of observational studies and to publish study plans for observational studies, like study plans are published for major clinical trials.
  
Regular readers will know my suggestion that scientific journals move away from the idea of being unique publishers of new material and move toward a “newsletter” approach, recommending papers from Arxiv, SSRN, etc.  So, instead of going through exhausting review and revision processes, the journal editors would read and review recent preprints on observational studies and then, each month or quarter or whatever, produce a list of pap</p><p>4 0.9196676 <a title="2171-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling_different_claims_about_working-class_voters.html">1385 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-20-Reconciling different claims about working-class voters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>5 0.9196068 <a title="2171-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Faculty_Position_in_Visualization%2C_Visual_Analytics%2C_Imaging%2C_and_Human_Centered_Computing.html">1651 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Faculty Position in Visualization, Visual Analytics, Imaging, and Human Centered Computing</a></p>

Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.

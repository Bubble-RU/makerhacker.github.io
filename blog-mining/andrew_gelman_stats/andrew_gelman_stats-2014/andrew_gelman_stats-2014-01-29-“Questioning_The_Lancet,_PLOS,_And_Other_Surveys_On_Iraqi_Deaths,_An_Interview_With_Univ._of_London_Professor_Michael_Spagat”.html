I agree.  It’s good stuff.  Here are some of the things that Spagat says (he’s being interviewed by Joel Wing):
  
In fact, the standard excess-deaths concept leads to an interesting conundrum when combined with an interesting fact exposed in the next-to-latest  Human Security Report ; in most countries child mortality rates decline during armed conflict (chapter 6). So if you believe the usual excess-death causality story then you’re forced to conclude that many conflicts actually save the lives of many children. Of course, the idea of wars savings lives is pretty hard to swallow.

</p><p>5 This should make us wonder whether there is any reality behind the excess deaths claims that have been based on this Iraq survey. [sent-14, score-0.232]
</p><p>6 Here’s Spagat again:    First of all, saying that something has to be right or is probably right because it has been peer reviewed is quite a weak defense. [sent-18, score-0.669]
</p><p>7 Peer review is a good thing, and it is a strength of scientific journals that there is that level of scrutiny, but if you look at the list of scientific claims that have turned out to be wrong and that have been published in peer reviewed journals…. [sent-19, score-1.157]
</p><p>8 Publishing in a peer reviewed journal is no guarantee that something is right. [sent-21, score-0.746]
</p><p>9 Mostly people just assume what they’re being told by the authors of the paper is correct and valid. [sent-25, score-0.137]
</p><p>10 Peer review is better than no peer review, but it hardly guarantees that something is going to be correct. [sent-26, score-0.682]
</p><p>11 Journal peer review is just the beginning of a long peer review process. [sent-30, score-1.364]
</p><p>12 Thinking that journal peer review is the end of this process is a serious misunderstanding. [sent-31, score-0.828]
</p><p>13 there have been a number of peer reviewed articles that have critiqued it, and said it is wrong. [sent-37, score-0.669]
</p><p>14 So if you think peer review has to always be correct then you’re immediately in a logical conundrum because you’ve got peer reviewed articles saying opposite things. [sent-38, score-1.536]

<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design. The paper also presents some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories. This evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or</p><p>3 0.22077508 <a title="2191-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-11-The_Reliability_of_Cluster_Surveys_of_Conflict_Mortality%3A_Violent_Deaths_and_Non-Violent_Deaths.html">849 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-11-The Reliability of Cluster Surveys of Conflict Mortality: Violent Deaths and Non-Violent Deaths</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat sends in an interesting explanation for the noted problems with conflict mortality studies (a topic we’ve discussed on occasion on this blog).  Spagat writes:
  
 This analysis  is based on the fact that conflict violence does not spread out at all uniformly across a map but, rather, tends to concentrate in a few areas.  This means that small, headline-grabbing violence surveys are extremely unreliable.


There is a second point, based on the work of David Hemenway which you’ve also cited on your blog.  Even within exceptionally violent environments most households will still not have a violent death.   So a very small false positive rate in a household survey will cause substantial upward bias in violence estimates.</p><p>4 0.2187025 <a title="2191-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-Dispute_over_counts_of_child_deaths_in_Iraq_due_to_sanctions.html">141 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-Dispute over counts of child deaths in Iraq due to sanctions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat writes:
  
 Here is  yet another debunking article I’ve written, this one in the latest issue of Significance.  It shows the Lancet once again publishing spectacularly wrong information that has misinformed public discussion on a crucial issue with ongoing reverberations.  For example, there is Tony Blair’s recent justification for the Iraq war offered in front of the Chilcot Inquiry in the UK quoted at the beginning of the paper.
  
I haven’t had a chance to look at this one, but  here’s a link  to some related Spagat work.</p><p>5 0.21839099 <a title="2191-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating_evidence_from_published_research.html">2006 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating evidence from published research</a></p>

I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat points to  this interview , which, he writes, covers themes that are discussed on the blog such as wrong ideas that don’t die, peer review and the statistics of conflict deaths.
 
I agree.  It’s good stuff.  Here are some of the things that Spagat says (he’s being interviewed by Joel Wing):
  
In fact, the standard excess-deaths concept leads to an interesting conundrum when combined with an interesting fact exposed in the next-to-latest  Human Security Report ; in most countries child mortality rates decline during armed conflict (chapter 6). So if you believe the usual excess-death causality story then you’re forced to conclude that many conflicts actually save the lives of many children. Of course, the idea of wars savings lives is pretty hard to swallow. A much more sensible understanding is that there are a variety of factors that determine child deaths and that in many cases the factors that save the lives of children are stronger than the negative effects that confli</p><p>2 0.95635891 <a title="2191-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-06-W%E2%80%99man_%3C_W%E2%80%99pedia%2C_again.html">945 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-06-W’man < W’pedia, again</a></p>

Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero. The allowance for “uphill” moves saves the method from becoming stuck at local minima—which are the bane of greedier methods.
  
And here’s Wegman:
  
During each step of the algorithm, the variable that will eventually represent the minimum is replaced by a random solution that is chosen according to a temperature</p><p>3 0.95363784 <a title="2191-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-22-Likelihood_Ratio_%E2%89%A0_1_Journal.html">1774 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-22-Likelihood Ratio ≠ 1 Journal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan  writes :
  
The basic idea . . . is to promote identification of study designs that scholars who disagree about a proposition would agree would generate evidence relevant to their competing conjectures—regardless of what studies based on such designs actually find. Articles proposing designs of this sort would be selected for publication and only then be carried out, by the proposing researchers with funding from the journal, which would publish the results too.


Now I [Kahan] am aware of a set of real journals that have a similar motivation.


One is the  Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, which as its title implies publishes papers reporting studies that fail to “reject” the null. Like JASNH, LR ≠1J would try to offset the “file drawer” bias and like bad consequences associated with the convention of publishing only findings that are “significant at p < 0.05."


But it would try to do more.

<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>5 0.94880497 <a title="2191-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

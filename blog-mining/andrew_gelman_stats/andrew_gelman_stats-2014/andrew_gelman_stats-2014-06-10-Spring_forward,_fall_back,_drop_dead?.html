Data from the largest study of its kind in the U.S. reveal a 25 percent jump in the number of heart attacks occurring the Monday after we “spring forward” compared to other Mondays during the year – a trend that remained even after accounting for seasonal variations in these events. But the study showed the opposite effect is also true. Researchers found a 21 percent drop in the number of heart attacks on the Tuesday after returning to standard time in the fall when we gain an hour back.
  
Rinaldi thinks:  “On Tuesday? No multiple comparisons here???”

<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.

What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year.  It would be easy enough to make.  That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.  While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates.  It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.
 
The data are publicly available, so maybe someone could make those graphs?  If the Valentine’s/Halloween data are worth publishing, I think more comprehensive graphs should be publishable as well.

The data come from the Center for Disease Control and cover the years 1969-1988. Chris also gives instructions for how to download the data and plot them in R from scratch (in 30 lines of R code)!
 
 And now, the background 
 
A few months ago I heard about a study reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days:

<p>Introduction: Andrew Mack writes:
  
There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>4 0.72050774 <a title="2367-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-26-%E2%80%9CPlease_make_fun_of_this_claim%E2%80%9D.html">2114 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-26-“Please make fun of this claim”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff sent me an email with the above title and a  link  to a press release, “Nut consumption reduces risk of death,” which begins:
  
According to the largest study of its kind, people who ate a daily handful of nuts were 20 percent less likely to die from any cause over a 30-year period than those who didn’t consume nuts . . . Their report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, contains further good news: The regular nut-eaters were found to be more slender than those who didn’t eat nuts, a finding that should alleviate fears that eating a lot of nuts will lead to overweight. . . .


For the new research, the scientists were able to tap databases from two well-known, ongoing observational studies that collect data on diet and other lifestyle factors and various health outcomes. The Nurses’ Health Study provided data on 76,464 women between 1980 and 2010, and the Health Professionals’ Follow-Up Study yielded data on 42,498 men from 1986 to 2010. . . .

<p>Introduction: One of the newsflies buzzing around today is an  article   “Brain tumour risk in relation to mobile telephone use: results of the INTERPHONE international case-control study” .
 
The results, shown in this pretty table below, appear to be inconclusive.
 
   
 
A limited amount of cellphone radiation is good for your brain, but not too much? It’s unfortunate that the extremes are truncated. The commentary at  Microwave News  blames bias:
  

The problem with selection bias –also called participation bias– became apparent after the brain tumor risks observed throughout the study were so low as to defy reason. If they reflect reality, they would indicate that cell phones confer immediate protection against tumors. All sides agree that this is extremely unlikely. Further analysis pointed to unanticipated differences between the cases (those with brain tumors) and the controls (the reference group).


The second problem concerns how accurately study participants could recall the amount of t</p><p>6 0.71214026 <a title="2367-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-13-You_heard_it_here_first%3A_Intense_exercise_can_suppress_appetite.html">2022 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-13-You heard it here first: Intense exercise can suppress appetite</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Antonio Rinaldi points me to  a press release  describing a  recent paper  by Amneet Sandhu, Milan Seth, and Hitinder Gurm, where I got the above graphs (sorry about the resolution, that’s the best I could do).
 
Here’s the press release:
  
Data from the largest study of its kind in the U.S. reveal a 25 percent jump in the number of heart attacks occurring the Monday after we “spring forward” compared to other Mondays during the year – a trend that remained even after accounting for seasonal variations in these events. But the study showed the opposite effect is also true. Researchers found a 21 percent drop in the number of heart attacks on the Tuesday after returning to standard time in the fall when we gain an hour back.
  
Rinaldi thinks:  “On Tuesday? No multiple comparisons here???”
 
The press release continues:
  
“What’s interesting is that the total number of heart attacks didn’t change the week after daylight saving time,” said Amneet Sandhu, M.D., cardiology fellow, Univer</p><p>2 0.94620883 <a title="2367-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-21-Job_openings_at_conservative_political_analytics_firm%21.html">1909 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-21-Job openings at conservative political analytics firm!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After posting that  announcement  about Civis Analytics, I wrote, “If a reconstituted Romney Analytics team is hiring, let me know and I’ll post that ad too.”  Adam Schaeffer  obliged :
  

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.


We’re looking for new talent to help with our fast-growing portfolio in these areas:

<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  shares  this graph from the  Economist :
 


 

 
 

I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:
 
 
Average Hours Per Day Spent in Each Activity

           Work,   Unpaid  Eating, Personal
Country    study    work  sleeping   care   Leisure  Other

France       4        3       11       1       2       2
Germany      4        3       10       1       3       3
Japan        6        2       10       1       2       2

<p>Introduction: Haynes Goddard writes:
  
I have been slowly working my way through the grad program in stats here, and the latest course was a biostats course on categorical and survival analysis.  I noticed in the semi-parametric  and parametric material (Wang and Lee is the text) that they use stepwise regression a lot.


I learned in econometrics that stepwise is poor practice, as it defaults to the “theory of the regression line”, that is no theory at all, just the variation in the data.


I don’t find the topic on your blog, and wonder if you have addressed the issue.
  
My reply:
 
Stepwise regression is one of these things, like outlier detection and pie charts, which appear to be popular among non-statisticans but are considered by statisticians to be a bit of a joke.  For example, Jennifer and I don’t mention stepwise regression in our book, not even once.
 
To address the issue more directly:  the motivation behind stepwise regression is that you have a lot of potential predictors but not e</p><p>6 0.94056678 <a title="2367-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-What_is_the_normal_range_of_values_in_a_medical_test%3F.html">923 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-What is the normal range of values in a medical test?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Social science research has been getting pretty bad press recently, what with the Excel buccaneers who didn’t know how to handle data with different numbers of observations per country, and the psychologist who published dozens of papers based on fabricated data, and the Evilicious guy who wouldn’t let people review his data tapes, etc etc.  And that’s not even considering Dr. Anil Potti.
 
On the other hand, the revelation of all these problems can be taken as evidence that things are getting better.  Psychology researcher Gary Marcus  writes :
  
There is something positive that has come out of the crisis of replicability—something vitally important for all experimental sciences. For years, it was extremely difficult to publish a direct replication, or a failure to replicate an experiment, in a good journal. . . . Now, happily, the scientific culture has changed. . . . The Reproducibility Project, from the Center for Open Science is now underway . . .

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>5 0.12680744 <a title="2179-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>6 0.12678181 <a title="2179-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-26-Suggested_resolution_of_the_Bem_paradox.html">1139 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-26-Suggested resolution of the Bem paradox</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The traditional system of scientific and scholarly publishing is breaking down in two different directions.
 
On one hand, we are moving away from relying on a small set of journals as gatekeepers: the number of papers and research projects is increasing, the number of publication outlets is increasing, and important manuscripts are being posted on SSRN, Arxiv, and other nonrefereed sites.
 
At the same time, many researchers are worried about the profusion of published claims that turn out to not replicate or in plain language, to be false. This concern is not new–some prominent discussions include Rosenthal (1979), Ioannidis (2005), and Vul et al. (2009)–but there is a growing sense that the scientific signal is being swamped by noise.
 
I recently had the opportunity to comment in the journal Political Analysis on two papers, one by Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt, and one by Monogan, on the preregistration of studies and mock reports.   Here’s  the issue of the journal.
 
Given the hi</p><p>3 0.84582973 <a title="2179-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-31-How_to_fix_the_tabloids%3F__Toward_replicable_social_science_research.html">1878 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-31-How to fix the tabloids?

<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>5 0.82624573 <a title="2179-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-19-The_replication_and_criticism_movement_is_not_about_suppressing_speculative_research%3B_rather%2C_it%E2%80%99s_all_about_enabling_science%E2%80%99s_fabled_self-correcting_nature.html">2217 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-19-The replication and criticism movement is not about suppressing speculative research; rather, it’s all about enabling science’s fabled self-correcting nature</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  points to  a post by Alex Holcombe, who disputes the idea that science is self-correcting.  Holcombe  writes  [scroll down to get to his part]:
  
The pace of scientific production has quickened, and self-correction has suffered. Findings that might correct old results are considered less interesting than results from more original research questions. Potential corrections are also more contested. As the competition for space in prestigious journals has become increasingly frenzied, doing and publishing studies that would confirm the rapidly accumulating new discoveries, or would correct them, became a losing proposition.
  
Holcombe picks up on some points that we’ve discussed a lot here in the past year.  Here’s Holcombe:
  
In certain subfields, almost all new work appears in only a very few journals, all associated with a single professional society. There is then no way around the senior gatekeepers, who may then suppress corrections with impunity. . . .

<p>Introduction: In  our new ethics column for Chance , Eric Loken and I write about our current favorite topic:
  
One of our ongoing themes when discussing scientific ethics is the central role of statistics in recognizing and communicating uncer- 
tainty. Unfortunately, statistics—and the scientific process more generally—often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. . . .


We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages—that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty—were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a</p><p>2 0.9284724 <a title="2179-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-30-That_puzzle-solving_feeling.html">492 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-30-That puzzle-solving feeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>3 0.92512959 <a title="2179-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: This  story  (“Yale tells students to keep Kissinger talk secret . . . ‘Dr. Kissinger’s visit to campus will not be publicized, so we appreciate your confidentiality…’”) reminds me of two things:
 
- In the 1980s, I once went to a public lecture at Harvard by Kissinger protogé Ted Koppel, who indeed has that deep Ted Koppel voice even when he’s just chatting (as I overheard).  Koppel insisted that the contents of his talk not be reported.  It was no great loss; he didn’t really have anything newsworthy to say.  The talk was fine, he told us some interesting things, just nothing that would’ve made the news or even the campus newspaper.  Still, it seemed kinda tacky for a reporter whose shtick was access to the powerful, to not want his own speech to be reported. 
 
- In the 1990s, a colleague of mine in a different dept told us that this professor from another university was coming by to give a lecture.  I told my colleague that I’d like to meet with the guy, as I wanted to ask his opin</p><p>5 0.9199993 <a title="2179-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Clarity_on_my_email_policy.html">503 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Clarity on my email policy</a></p>

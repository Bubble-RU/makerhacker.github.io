But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that.

This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  discusses  the following  graph  that is captioned, “A study of 54 nations–ranked below–found that those with more progressive tax rates had happier citizens, on average.”
 
   
 
As Kaiser writes, “from a purely graphical perspective, the chart is well executed . . . they have 54 points, and the chart still doesn’t look too crammed . . .”  But he also points out that the graph’s implicit claims (that tax rates can explain happiness or cause more happiness) are not supported.
 
Kaiser and I are not being picky-picky-picky here.  Taken literally, the graph title says nothing about causation, but I think the phrasing implies it.  Also, from a purely descriptive perspective, the graph is somewhat at war with its caption.  The caption announces a relationship, but in the graph, the x and y variables have only a very weak correlation.  The caption says that happiness and progressive tax rates go together, but the graph uses the U.S. as a baseline, and when you move from the U.S</p><p>6 0.16426042 <a title="437-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Further_thoughts_on_happiness_and_life_satisfaction_research.html">98 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Further thoughts on happiness and life satisfaction research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups. In Europe, the poor and those on the left of the political spectru</p><p>6 0.69260627 <a title="437-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-24-Differences_in_color_perception_by_sex%2C_also_the_Bechdel_test_for_women_in_movies.html">161 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-24-Differences in color perception by sex, also the Bechdel test for women in movies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

In general, is there any way to do MCMC with a fixed constraint?


E.g., suppose I measure the three internal angles of a triangle with errors ~dnorm(0, tau) where tau might be different for the three measurements.  This would be an easy BUGS/WinBUGS/JAGS exercise but suppose, in addition, I wanted to include prior information to the effect that the three angles had to total 180 degrees exactly.


Is this feasible? Could you point me to any BUGS model in which a constraint of this type is implemented?


Note: Even in my own (non-hierarchical) code which tends to be component-wise, random-walk Metropolis with tuned Laplacian proposals, I cannot see how I could incorporate such a constraint.
  
My reply:  See page 508 of Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd edition).  We have an example of such a model there (from  this paper  with Bois and Jiang).</p><p>4 0.92217469 <a title="437-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-30-Why_don%E2%80%99t_we_have_peer_reviewing_for_oral_presentations%3F.html">172 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-30-Why don’t we have peer reviewing for oral presentations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Panos Ipeirotis  writes in his blog  post :
  

Everyone who has attended a conference knows that the quality of the talks is very uneven. There are talks that are highly engaging, entertaining, and describe nicely the research challenges and solutions. And there are talks that are a waste of time. Either the presenter cannot present clearly, or the presented content is impossible to digest within the time frame of the presentation.


We already have reviewing for the written part. The program committee examines the quality of the written  paper and vouch for its technical content. However, by looking at a paper it is impossible to know how nicely it can be presented. Perhaps the seemingly solid but boring paper can be a very entertaining presentation. Or an excellent paper may be written by a horrible presenter.


Why not having a second round of reviewing, where the authors of accepted papers submit their presentations (slides and a YouTube video) for presentation to the conference.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.91947609 <a title="437-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.
  
They write:

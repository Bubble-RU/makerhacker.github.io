<p>Introduction: You know that expression, “Not from the Onion”?  How did we say that, all those years before the Onion existed?
 
I was thinking about this after encountering (amidst a Google search for something else)  this article  on a website called “College News”:
  
DANVILLE, KY., March 8, 2007–Two Centre College professors spent the past six years reading and analyzing 200 children’s books to discover a disturbing trend: gender bias still exists in much of modern children’s literature.


Dr. David Anderson, professor of economics, and Dr. Mykol Hamilton, professor of psychology, have documented that gender bias is common today in many children’s books in their research published recently in Sex Roles: A Journal of Research titled “Gender Stereotyping and Under-Representation of Female Characters in 200 Popular Children’s Picture Books: A 21st Century Update.” . . .

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  sends  along  this  from Corinne Moss-Racusin, John Dovidio, Victoria Brescoll, Mark Graham, and Jo Handelsman:
  
Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. . . . In a randomized double-blind study . . . science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. . . .
  
I hate to talk about things like this since presumably I’m a beneficiary.  But now that I’ve climbed the ladder myself I suppose I’m not at any risk.  I don’t know anything much about lab manager positions—that’s more something you’d see in a biology department—but I do</p><p>5 0.11249363 <a title="174-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-21-Careers%2C_one-hit_wonders%2C_and_an_offer_of_a_free_book.html">46 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-21-Careers, one-hit wonders, and an offer of a free book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: J. Robert Lennon  writes :
  
At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest.

<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”
  
This sounds fascinating.  But I’m skeptical about this part:

<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  asked  what happened to Matthew Klam, a talented writer who has a bizarrely professional-looking webpage but didn’t seem to be writing anymore.
 
Good news!  He published  a new story  in the New Yorker!  Confusingly, he wrote it under the name “Justin Taylor,” but I’m not fooled (any more than I was fooled when that posthumous Updike story was published under the name “ Antonya Nelson “).  I’m glad to see that Klam is back in action and look forward to seeing some stories under his own name as well.</p><p>4 0.70710951 <a title="174-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-16-The_Art_of_Fielding.html">1381 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-16-The Art of Fielding</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  discusses  his and Bryan Caplan’s reaction to that notorious book by Amy Chua, the Yale law professor who boasts of screaming at her children, calling them “garbage,” not letting them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano, etc.  Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel.  Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes).

<p>Introduction: What can we learn about an author from his or her fiction?  This is an old, old question, I know.  But I still can’t help thinking about it when I read a book.
 
 John Updike ‘s stories are full of male characters whom women find irresistibly attractive.  I can only assume that this reflects Updike’s own experiences, to some extent.  If he had not been, in reality, catnip to women, I imagine he’d have made more of a big deal about the episodes in his books where women kept falling into his protagonists’ laps.
 
Same for  John D. Macdonald , although there I suppose it’s possible he was just throwing in the sex to sell books.
 
And even more so for  Richard Ford .  This guy’s male characters are so smooth, there’s no way that Ford isn’t/wasn’t like that too.
 
What about Lorrie Moore?  I think she must have had a very frustrating life (so far).  I say this because her stories always seem to be centered around a female character who is witty, thoughtful, and refined, and surrounded by re</p><p>2 0.99907941 <a title="174-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-04-%E2%80%9CBestselling_Author_Caught_Posting_Positive_Reviews_of_His_Own_Work_on_Amazon%E2%80%9D.html">1483 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-04-“Bestselling Author Caught Posting Positive Reviews of His Own Work on Amazon”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t have much sympathy for well-paid academic plagiarists who are too lazy to do their jobs, but I actually can feel for the author in  this story  who posted fake positive Amazon reviews of his own books and negative reviews of his competitors’.
 
I mean, sure, this is despicable behavior, I won’t deny that, but it’s gotta be harder and harder to make money writing books.  Even a so-called bestselling author must feel under a lot of pressure.  I was recently reading a book by Jonathan Coe—he’s just great, and famous, and celebrated, but I doubt he’s getting rich from his books.  Not that there’s any reason that he has to get rich, but if even  Jonathan Coe  isn’t living the high life, that’s not good for authors in general.  It’s a far cry from the days in which Updike, Styron, etc., could swagger around like bigshots.</p><p>3 0.9990533 <a title="174-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-09-Popper%E2%80%99s_great%2C_but_don%E2%80%99t_bother_with_his_theory_of_probability.html">23 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-09-Popper’s great, but don’t bother with his theory of probability</a></p>

Any chance you could do a post explaining Popper’s propensity theory of probability?  I have never understood it.
  
My reply:  I’m a big fan of Popper (search this blog for details), especially as interpreted by Lakatos, but as far as I can tell, Popper’s theory of probability is hopeless.  We’ve made a lot of progress on probability in the past 75 years, and I don’t see any real need to go back to the bad old days.</p><p>4 0.99874008 <a title="174-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Jelte_Wicherts_lays_down_the_stats_on_IQ.html">6 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Jelte Wicherts lays down the stats on IQ</a></p>

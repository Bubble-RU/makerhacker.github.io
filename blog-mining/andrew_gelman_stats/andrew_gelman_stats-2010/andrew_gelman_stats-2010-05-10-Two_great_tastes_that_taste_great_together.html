You and your blog readers may be interested to know that a we’ve released a major new version of the BayesFactor package to CRAN. The package computes Bayes factors for linear mixed models and regression models. Of course, I’m aware you don’t like point-null model comparisons, but the package does more than that; it also allows sampling from posterior distributions of the compared models, in much the same way that your arm package does with lmer objects. The sampling (both for the Bayes factors and posteriors) is quite fast, since the back end is written in C.


Some basic examples using the package can be found  here , and the CRAN page is  here .

How would you explain, to a “classically-trained” hypothesis-tester, that “It’s OK to fit a multilevel model even if some groups have only one observation each”?


I [O'Brien] think I understand the logic and the statistical principles at work in this, but I’ve having trouble being clear and persuasive. I also feel like I’m contending with some methodological conventional wisdom here. 
  
My reply:  I’m so used to this idea that I find it difficult to defend it in some sort of general conceptual way.  So let me retreat to a more functional defense, which is that multilevel modeling gives good estimates,  especially  when the number of observations per group is small.
 
One way to see this in any particular example in through cross-validation.  Another way is to consider the alternatives.   If you try really hard you can come up with a “classical hypothesis testing” approach which will do as well as the multilevel model.  It would just take a lot of work.

I am convinced of the power of hierarchical modeling and individual parameter pooling concept. I was wondering how could multi-level modeling could influence the estimate of grad mean (NOT individual label).
  
My reply:  Multilevel modeling will affect the estimate of the grand mean in two ways:
 
1.  If the group-level mean is correlated with group size, then the partial pooling will change the estimate of the grand mean (and, indeed, you might want to include group size or some similar variable as a group-level predictor.
 
2.  In any case, the extra error term(s) in a multilevel model will typically affect the standard error of everything, including the estimate of the grand mean.</p><p>5 0.16188708 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-15-Exploratory_multilevel_analysis_when_group-level_variables_are_of_importance.html">1900 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-15-Exploratory multilevel analysis when group-level variables are of importance</a></p>

Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

<p>Introduction: Having established that survey weighting is a mess, I should also acknowledge that, by this standard, regression modeling is also a mess, involving many arbitrary choices of variable selection, transformations and modeling of interaction. Nonetheless, regression modeling is a mess with which I am comfortable and, perhaps more relevant to the discussion, can be extended using multilevel models to get inference for small cross-classifications or small areas.

I’m an epidemiologist at Emory University, and I’m working on a project of release patterns in jails (basically trying to model how long individuals are in jail before they’re release, for purposes of designing short-term health interventions, i.e. HIV testing, drug counseling, etc…). The question lends itself to quantile regression; we’re interested in the # of days it takes for 50% and 75% of inmates to be released. But being a clustered/nested data structure, it also obviously lends itself to multilevel modeling, with the group-level being individual jails.


So: do you know of any work on multilevel quantile regression? My quick lit search didn’t yield much, and I don’t see any preprogrammed way to do it in SAS.

I am using a multilevel model with three levels. I read that you wrote a book about multilevel models, and wonder if you can solve the following question.  


The data structure is like this: 


Level one: customer (8444 customers) 
Level two: companys (90 companies) 
Level three: industry (17 industries) 


I use 6 level-three variables (i.e. industry characteristics) to explain the variance of the level-one effect across industries. The question here is whether there is an over-fitting problem since there are only 17 industries. I understand that this must be a problem for non-multilevel models, but is it also a problem for multilevel models?
  
My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.  This is an interesting and important area of statistics research, to do this sort of thing systematically.

The problem in working on involves a multi-nation survey of students, and I’m especially interested in understanding the effects of country, religion, and sex, and the interactions among those factors (using IRT to estimate individual-level ability, then estimating individual, school, and country effects).


Following the basic approach laid out in chapter 13 for such interactions between levels, I think I need to create a matrix of indicator variables for religion and sex. Elsewhere in the book, you recommend against indicator variables in favor of a single index variable.

<p>Introduction: My short answer (based on the research of Leighley and Nagler):
  
Whether or not mandatory voting is a good idea, I think it’s unlikely to happen at a national level. Even setting aside the practical difficulties of taking a now-voluntary action and making it compulsory, bringing in the other half of the potential electorate would change the political conversation so much that it’s hard for me to see current officeholders supporting such a plan.

I’ve using your book on regression and multilevel modeling and have a quick R question for you. Do you happen to know if there is any R package that can estimate a two-stage (instrumental variable) multi-level model?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to this  interesting article  by Vasik Rajlich and Frederic Friedel.  I find these sorts of things fun to read, but the horrible thing is that I just get worse and worse as a player.  I seem to have lost the ability to automatically filter out the worst moves.  Not that I was ever any good, but now I can’t seem to go five moves without making a major blunder.  I’m seriously thinking about never leaving any pieces unprotected even for a single move, just so I don’t have to worry about forgetting about them.

<p>Introduction: I was invited by the Columbia University residence halls to speak at an event on gay marriage.  (I’ve assisted my colleagues Jeff Lax and Justin Phillips in their research on the topic.)  The event sounded fun–unfortunately I’ll be out of town that weekend so can’t make it–but it got me thinking about how gay marriage and other social issues are so relaxing to think about because there’s no need for doubt.
 
About half of Americans support same-sex marriage and about half oppose it.  And the funny thing is, you can be absolutely certain in your conviction, from either direction.  If you support, it’s a simple matter of human rights, and it’s a bit ridiculous to suppose that if gay marriage is allowed, it will somehow wreck all the straight marriages out there.  Conversely, you can oppose on the clear rationale of wanting to keep marriage the same as it’s always been, and suggest that same-sex couples can be free to get together outside of marriage, as they always could.

<p>Introduction: So  asks  James Ledbetter in Slate.
 
And  the answer is  . . . No!
 
Here’s what happened in 2008:
 
 
 
OK, that’s how people vote.  How bout party identification and ideology?   Check these out :

P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

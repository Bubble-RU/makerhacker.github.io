<p>Introduction: Steven Hayward at the American Enterprise Institute wrote  an article , sure to attract the attention of people such as myself, entitled, “The irrelevance of modern political science,” in which he discusses some silly-sounding papers presented at the recent American Political Science Association and then moves to a larger critique of quantitative political science:
  
 
I [Hayward] have often taken a random article from the American Political Science Review, which resembles a mathematical journal on most of its pages, and asked students if they can envision this method providing the mathematical formula that will deliver peace in the Middle East. Even the dullest students usually grasp the point without difficulty.
 

 
At the sister blog, John Sides  discusses and dismisses  Hayward’s arguments, point on that, among other things, political science might very well be useful  even if  it doesn’t deliver peace in the Middle East.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.10105585 <a title="276-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-27-Hack_pollster_Doug_Schoen_illustrates_a_general_point%3A__The_%231_way_to_lie_with_statistics_is_._._._to_just_lie%21.html">977 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-27-Hack pollster Doug Schoen illustrates a general point:  The #1 way to lie with statistics is . . . to just lie!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everybody knows how you can lie with statistics by manipulating numbers, making inappropriate comparisons, misleading graphs, etc.  But, as I like to remind students, the simplest way to lie with statistics is to just lie!  You see this all the time, advocates who make up numbers or present numbers with such little justification that they might as well be made up (as in  this  purported survey of the “super-rich”).
 
Here I’m not talking about the  innumeracy  of a Samantha Power or  a  David Runciman, or Michael Barone-style  confusion  or Gregg Easterbrook-style  cluelessness  or even Tucker Carlson-style  asininity .  No, I’m talking about flat-out lying by a professional who has the numbers and deliberately chooses to misrepresent them.
 
The culprit is pollster Doug Schoen, and  the catch  was made by Jay Livingston.  Schoen wrote the following based on a survey he took of Occupy Wall Street participants:

<p>Introduction: The other day on the sister blog we  discussed  a recent Pew Research survey that seemed to show that Republicans are becoming more partisan about evolution (or, as Paul Krugman put it, “So what happened after 2009 that might be driving Republican views? . . . Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”).
 
We presented some discussion and evidence from Dan Kahan suggesting that the evidence for such a change was not so clear at all.  Kahan drew his conclusions from a more detailed analysis of the much-discussed Pew data, along with a comparison to a recent Gallup poll.
 
Also following up on this is sociologist David Wealiem, who pulls some more data into the discussion: 
  
  
Although the Pew report mentions only the 2009 survey, the question has been asked a number of times since 2005.

From the press release:
  
Entries from around the world focused on data related to the economic costs and return on investment in education . . . [The winning entry] takes a detailed look at public vs. private and men vs. women for selected countries . . .


The judges were particularly impressed by the angled slope format of the visualisation, which encourages comparison between the upper-secondary and tertiary benefits of education.

Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.
 
P.S.  I l</p><p>5 0.71539754 <a title="276-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Why_display_6_years_instead_of_30%3F.html">1258 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Why display 6 years instead of 30?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to be the go-to guy for bad graphs.  Today (i.e., 22 Feb), I received an email from Gary Rosin:
  
I [Rosin] thought you might be interested in  this  graph showing the decline in median prices of homes since 1997. It exaggerates the  proportions by using $150,000 as the floor, rather than zero.
  
Indeed.  Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
A line plot, rather than a bar plot, would be appropriate here.  Also, it’s weird that the headline says “10 years” but the graph has only 6 years.  Why not give some perspective and show, say, 30 years?</p><p>6 0.70096058 <a title="276-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-13-Coauthorship_norms.html">609 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-13-Coauthorship norms</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Bruce Mannheim  reports  that a recent well-publicized study on the genetics of native Americans, which used genetic analysis to find “at least three streams of Asian gene flow,” is in fact a confirmation of a long-known fact.  Mannheim writes:
  
This three-way distinction was known linguistically since the 1920s (for example, Sapir 1921). Basically, it’s a division among the Eskimo-Aleut languages, which straddle the Bering Straits even today, the Athabaskan languages (which were discovered to be related to a small Siberian language family only within the last few years, not by Greenberg as Wade suggested), and everything else.
  
This is not to say that the results from genetics are unimportant, but it’s good to see how it fits with other aspects of our understanding.</p><p>2 0.98410678 <a title="276-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-11-Migrating_your_blog_from_Movable_Type_to_WordPress.html">1530 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-11-Migrating your blog from Movable Type to WordPress</a></p>

I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”


Well, here’s what you can find on Google.

I saw your  recent blog post  where you discussed in passing an iterative-chain-of models approach to AI. 


I essentially built such a thing for  my PhD thesis  – not in a Bayesian context, but in a logic programming context – and proved it had a few properties and showed how you could solve some toy problems. The important bit of my framework was that at various points you also go and get more data in the process – in a statistical context this might be seen as building a little univariate model on a subset of the data, then iteratively extending into a better model with more data and more independent variables – a generalized forward stepwise regression if you like.  It wrapped a proper computational framework around E.M. Gold’s identification/learning in the limit based on a logic my advisor (Eric Martin) had invented.

With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live.

<p>Introduction: Shankar Vedantam  writes :
  
Americans distrust the GOP. So why are they voting for it? . . . Gallup tells us that 71 percent of all Americans blame Republican policies for the bad economy, while only 48 percent blame the Obama administration. . . . while disapproval of congressional Democrats stands at 61 percent, disapproval of congressional Republicans stands at 67 percent.


[But] Republicans are heavily tipped to wrest control of one or both houses of Congress from the Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
  
Hey!  I know the answer to that one.  As I  wrote  in early September:
  
 
Those 10% or so of voters who plan to vote Republican–even while thinking that the Democrats will do a better job–are not necessarily being so unreasonable. The Democrats control the presidency and both houses of Congress, and so it’s a completely reasonable stance to prefer them to the Republicans yet still think they’ve gone too far and need a check on their power.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had. There’s a  nice sor</p><p>4 0.78126979 <a title="279-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-Why_it_can_be_rational_to_vote.html">389 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-Why it can be rational to vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko writes:
  
We’ve heard a lot recently about the Republican voters going with less electable candidates (last night in particular), but I [Palko] wonder whether this is less a question of putting less weight on electability and more of having a different perception of electability. Is this really a case of primary voters who supported O’Donnell saying “I’d rather be right than be president” or do a large percentage of them believe she has a better than even chance in November.
  
My reply:
 
It’s not so horrible for people to engage in non-strategic voting!  Beyond the immediate probabilities of this candidate winning the Senate election in November, primary challenges keep incumbents accountable.  The thing I don’t really understand is why there aren’t more such challenges.  I suppose they’re unlikely enough to succeed that it’s not usually worth doing it and risking your political career.
 
But, yes, I’m pretty sure that O’Donnell’s voters overestimated the chance that she’</p><p>2 0.93583667 <a title="279-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-20-We_are_what_we_are_studying.html">1947 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-20-We are what we are studying</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins  writes :
  
When native Australians or New Guineans say that their totemic animals and plants are their kinsmen – that these species are persons like themselves, and that in offering them to others they are giving away part of their own substance – we have to take them seriously, which is to say empirically, if we want to understand the large consequences of these facts for how they organise their lives. The graveyard of ethnographic studies is strewn with the remains of reports which, thanks to anthropologists’ own presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact, were content to ignore or debunk the Amazonian peoples who said that the animals they hunted were their brothers-in-law, the Africans who described the way they systematically killed their kings when they became weak, or the Fijian chiefs who claimed they were gods.
  
My first thought was . . . wait a minute!  Whazzat with “presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact”?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>4 0.9293133 <a title="279-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-03-Public_Opinion_on_Health_Care_Reform.html">15 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-03-Public Opinion on Health Care Reform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My article with Daniel and Yair  has recently appeared in The Forum:
  
We use multilevel modeling to estimate support for health-care reform by age, income, and state. Opposition to reform is concentrated among higher-income voters and those over 65. Attitudes do not vary much by state. Unfortunately, our poll data only go to 2004, but we suspect that much can be learned from the relative positions of different demographic groups and different states, despite swings in national opinion. We speculate on the political implications of these findings.
  
The article features some pretty graphs that originally appeared on the blog.
 
It’s in a special issue on health care politics that has several interesting articles, among which I’d like to single out  this one  by Bob Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs entitled, “Simulating Representation: Elite Mobilization and Political Power in Health Care Reform”:

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi has some  very interesting things to say :
  
As the election season draws closer, considerable attention will be paid to prices in prediction markets such as Intrade. Contracts for potential presidential nominees are already being scrutinized for early signs of candidate strength. . . .


This interpretation of prices as probabilities is common and will be repeated frequently over the coming months. But what could the “perceived likelihood according to the market” possibly mean?


Prediction market prices contain valuable information about this distribution of beliefs, but  there is no basis for the common presumption that the price at last trade represents the beliefs of a hypothetical average trader  in any meaningful sense [emphasis added]. In fact, to make full use of market data to make inferences about the distribution of beliefs, one needs to look beyond the price at last trade and examine the entire order book.

If I were in a snarky mood, I’d say something like, Causality is always in doubt in economics . . . unless you’re talking about abortion and crime, in which case you can be absolutely certain.

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  a recent article , “Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems,” by fisheries researchers George Sugihara, Robert May, Hao Ye, Chih-hao Hsieh, Ethan Deyle, Michael Fogarty, and Stephan Munch.
 
I don’t know anything about ecology research but I could imagine this method being useful in that field.  I can’t see the approach doing much in political science, where I think their stated goal of “identifying causal networks” is typically irrelevant.
 
That said, if you replace the word “causality” by “predictability” everywhere in the paper, it starts to make a lot more sense.  As they write, they are working within “a framework that uses predictability as opposed to correlation to identify causation between time-series variables.”  Setting causation aside, predictability is an important topic in itself.  The search for patterns of predictability in complex structures may motivate causal hypotheses that can be studied more directly, using more traditional statis</p><p>5 0.10330378 <a title="212-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-The_virtues_of_incoherence%3F.html">792 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-The virtues of incoherence?</a></p>

I just read your article  The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis . I agree on the importance of what you flagged as “comparable incoherence in all other statistical philosophies”. The problem arises when a string of unexpected observations persuades that one’s original structural hypothesis (which might be viewed as a parameter describing the type of statistical relationship) was false. 


However, I would phrase this more positively. Your Bayesian prior actually cedes alternative structural hypotheses, albeit with tiny epsilon weights. Otherwise you would never change your mind. However, these epsilons are so difficult to measure, and small differences can have such a significant impact on speed of adjustment (as in the example in Chapter 7 of Pandora’s Risk), that effectively we all look incoherent. This is a prime example of rational turbulence.

Here in Italy an “hype” topic is the “staffetta tra generazioni”, handover between generations: since unemployment rate in young people is very high, someone in the government is thinking to encourage older people to anticipate their retirement to make more jobs available for youngs. 
I am not an economist and I don’t want to discuss the economic plausibility of such a possible measure. 
However, some economists deny its success simply on the basis of a correlation and regression analysis.

I [Hoaglin] have a different take on the difficulty of interpreting the estimated coefficient of the county-level basement proportion (gamma-sub-2) on page 434.  An important part of the difficulty involves “other things being equal.”  That sounds like the widespread interpretation of a regression coefficient as telling how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor when the other predictors are held constant.  Unfortunately, as a general interpretation, that language is oversimplified; it doesn’t reflect how regression actually works.  The appropriate general interpretation is that the coefficient tells how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor after allowing for simultaneous change in the other predictors in the data at hand.

How do you test for no effect? I attended a seminar where the person assumed that a non significant difference between groups implied an absence of effect. In that case, the researcher needed to show that two groups were similar before being hit by a shock conditional on some observable variables. The assumption was that the two groups were similar and that the shock was random. What would be the good way to set up a test in that case?


I know you’ve been through that before (http://andrewgelman.com/2009/02/not_statistical/) and there are interesting comments but I wanted to have your opinion on that.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>6 0.67337906 <a title="212-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation_to_check_missing-data_imputation.html">1330 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation to check missing-data imputation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: José Iparraguirre writes:
  
There’s  a letter  in the latest issue of The Economist (July 31st) signed by Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), Michael Masters (Masters Capital Management) and David Frenk (Better Markets) about an    “>OECD report  on speculation and the prices of commodities, which includes the following: “The report uses a Granger causality test to measure the relationship between the level of commodities futures contracts held by swap dealers, and the prices of those commodities. Granger tests, however, are of dubious applicability to extremely volatile variables like commodities prices.”
  
The report says:
  
Granger causality is a standard statistical technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. It is important to bear in mind that the term causality is used in a statistical sense, and not in a philosophical one of structural causation. More precisely a variable A is said to Granger cause B if knowing the time paths of B and A toge</p><p>3 0.92285836 <a title="212-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-07-%E2%80%9CDoes_researching_casual_marijuana_use_cause_brain_abnormalities%3F%E2%80%9D.html">2363 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-07-“Does researching casual marijuana use cause brain abnormalities?”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  defines  a Ddulite as follows:
  
A preference for higher tech solutions even in cases where lower tech alternatives have greater and more appropriate functionality; a person of ddulite tendencies.


Though Ddulites are the opposite of Luddites with respect to attitudes toward technology, they occupy more or less the same point with respect to functionality.
  
As a sometime Luddite myself (no cell phone, tv, microwave oven, etc.), I should in fairness point out the logic in favor of being a Ddulite.  Old technology is typically pretty stable; new technology is improving.  It can make sense to switch early (before the new technology actually performs better than the old) to get the benefits of being familiar with the new technology once it does take off.</p><p>5 0.9094848 <a title="212-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-MCMC_in_Python.html">181 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-MCMC in Python</a></p>

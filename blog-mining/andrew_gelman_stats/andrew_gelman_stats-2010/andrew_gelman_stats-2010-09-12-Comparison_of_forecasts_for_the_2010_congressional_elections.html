</p><p>6 The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an election, and so you want to fit a model to the polls when making a forecast, rather than just taking their numbers at face value. [sent-8, score-0.679]
</p><p>7 Methods    Having read Nate’s description of his methods and also the Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien paper, my impression is that the two forecasting procedures are very similar. [sent-9, score-0.164]
</p><p>8 Both of them use national-level information to predict the nationwide vote swing, then use district-level information to map that national swing onto a district level. [sent-10, score-1.119]
</p><p>9 Finally, both methods represent forecasting uncertainty as a probability distribution over the 435 district-level outcomes and then summarize that distribution using simulations. [sent-11, score-0.449]

</p><p>12 Nate also looks at local polls and expert district-by-district forecasts from the Cook Report and CQ Politics and, where these polls forecasts differ from the adjusted-uniform-swing model above, he compromises between the different sources of available information. [sent-18, score-1.182]
</p><p>13 He also throws in other district-level information including data on campaign contributions. [sent-19, score-0.171]
</p><p>14 Fit the model to previous years’ data and use the errors in those retrospective fit to get an estimate of forecast uncertainty. [sent-21, score-0.653]
</p><p>15 Using simulation, propagate that uncertainty to get uncertain forecast of elections at the district and national levels. [sent-22, score-1.081]
</p><p>16 As  Kari and I discuss , to a large extent, local and national swings can be modeled separately, and it is a common mistake for people to look at just one or the other. [sent-24, score-0.474]
</p><p>17 The key difference between Nate’s forecast and the others seems to be step 2a. [sent-25, score-0.477]
</p><p>18 Even if, as I expect, step 2a adds little to the accuracy of the national forecast, I think it’s an excellent idea–after all, the elections are being held within districts. [sent-26, score-0.406]
</p><p>19 And, as Nate notes, when the local information differs dramatically from the nationally-forecast trend, often something interesting is going on. [sent-27, score-0.286]
</p><p>20 And these sorts of anomalies should be much more easily found by comparing to forecasts than by looking at polls in isolation. [sent-28, score-0.536]

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog comments made me rethink how to express disagreement when I write.  I’ll first display my original blog entry, then some of the comments, then my reaction, and finally my new approach.  As usual with negative comments, my first reaction was to be upset, but once the hurt feelings went away, I realized that these dudes had a point.
 
 Act 1 
 
A few days I ago, I posted the following on 538:
  
Self-described “ political operative ” Les Francis, with real-world experience as former executive director of the Democratic National Committee:

 
I don’t need any polls to tell me that Republicans will do well in November. The “out” party almost always shows significant gains in the first midterm election of a new President. 
 

 Political scientists  Joe Bafumi, Bob Erikson, and Chris Wlezien, from elite, out-of-touch, ivory-tower institutions Dartmouth, Columbia, and Temple Universities:


   


Game over.

<p>Introduction: I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc., or see here for a  more technical paper  with Kari Lock) but had a few things to add in light of Sam Wang’s  recent efforts . As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.  I</p><p>4 0.34093544 <a title="270-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-27-Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien_predict_a_50-seat_loss_for_Democrats_in_November.html">237 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-27-Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien predict a 50-seat loss for Democrats in November</a></p>
<p>Introduction: They  write :
  
How many House seats will the Republicans gain in 2010? . . . Our methodology replicates that for our ultimately successful forecast of the 2006 midterm. Two weeks before Election Day in 2006, we posted  a prediction that the Democrats would gain 32 seats and recapture the House majority. The Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006. Our current forecast for 2010 shows that the Republicans are likely to regain the House majority. . . . the most likely scenario is  a Republican majority in the neighborhood of 229 seats versus 206 for the Democrats for a 50-seat loss for the Democrats .
  
How do they do it?  First, they predict the national two-party vote using the generic polls (asking voters which party they plan to vote for in the November congressional elections).  Then they apply the national vote swing on a district-by-district level to predict the outcome in each district.  They account for uncertainty in their predictions (I assume by using a model similar to what  Gar</p><p>5 0.31786469 <a title="270-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-A_calibrated_Cook_gives_Dems_the_edge_in_Nov%2C_sez_Sandy.html">300 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-A calibrated Cook gives Dems the edge in Nov, sez Sandy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>6 0.31221026 <a title="270-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-Politics_is_not_a_random_walk%3A__Momentum_and_mean_reversion_in_polling.html">364 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-Politics is not a random walk:  Momentum and mean reversion in polling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010.

<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, Henry  writes  about poll averaging and election forecasts.  Henry writes that “These models need to crunch lots of polls, at the state and national level, if they’re going to provide good predictions.” Actually, you can get reasonable predictions from national-level forecasting models plus previous state-level election results, then when the election comes closer you can use national and state polls as needed. See my paper with Kari Lock,  Bayesian combination of state polls and election forecasts .  (That said, the method in that paper is fairly complicated, much more so than simply taking weighted averages of state polls, if such abundant data happen to be available.  And I’m sure our approach would need to be altered if it were used for real-time forecasts.)

<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>2 0.96409488 <a title="270-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-09-Data_Visualization.html">194 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-09-Data Visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc., or see here for a  more technical paper  with Kari Lock) but had a few things to add in light of Sam Wang’s  recent efforts . As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.

Of all the subjects a student is likely to encounter after elementary school, mathematics is by far the easiest to teach yourself. . . . 


What is it that makes math teachers so expendable? . . .


At some point all disciplines require the transition from passive to active and that transition can be challenging. In courses like high school history and science, the emphasis on passively acquiring knowledge (yes, I realize that students write essays in history classes and apply formulas in science classes but that represents a relatively small portion of their time and, more importantly, the work those students do is fundamentally different from the day-to-day work done by historians and scientists). By comparison, junior high students playing in an orchestra, writing short stories or solving math problems are almost entirely focused on processes and those processes are essentially the same as those engaged in by professional musicians, writers and mat</p><p>3 0.21891911 <a title="390-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-25-Why_I_decided_not_to_be_a_physicist.html">2347 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-25-Why I decided not to be a physicist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As I’ve written before, I was a math and physics major in college but I switched to statistics because math seemed pointless if you weren’t the best (and I knew there were people better than me), and I just didn’t feel like I had a good physical understanding.
 
My lack of physical understanding comes up from time to time.  An example occurred the other day.  I was viewing a demonstration of Foucault’s pendulum and the guide said the period was something like 35 hours.  I was surprised, having always thought it had a 24-hour period.  Sure, I can understand it in words, but, even after reflecting on it for a minute, I couldn’t see my way to even an approximate derivation.  If I wanted to, I think I could go through the math (for example  here ), but I feel that if I really had the intuition, I wouldn’t need to.
 
I’m sure I have a lot more physical understanding than the average person but I don’t think I have enough to be a real physicist.</p><p>4 0.20227303 <a title="390-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-02-%E2%80%9CThe_sky_is_the_limit%E2%80%9D_isn%E2%80%99t_such_a_good_thing.html">835 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-02-“The sky is the limit” isn’t such a good thing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago, in response to some reflections from Steve Hsu, I  wrote  the following:
  
I’ve long been glad that when I went to college in the 80s, I was at MIT rather than Harvard. Either place I would’ve taken hard classes and learned a lot, but one advantage of MIT was that we had no sense–no sense at all–that we could make big bucks. We had no sense of making moderately big bucks as lawyers, no sense of making big bucks working on Wall Street, and no sense of making really big bucks by starting a business. I mean, sure, we knew about lawyers (but we didn’t know that a lawyer with technical skills would be a killer combination), we knew about Wall Street (but we had no idea what they did, other than shout pork belly prices across a big room), and we knew about tech startups (but we had no idea that they were anything to us beyond a source of jobs for engineers). What we were all looking for was a good solid job with cool benefits (like those companies in California that had gy</p><p>5 0.19940871 <a title="390-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-24-Bell_Labs.html">970 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-24-Bell Labs</a></p>

I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>6 0.198034 <a title="390-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-07-Feedback_on_my_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_class_at_Columbia.html">1611 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-07-Feedback on my Bayesian Data Analysis class at Columbia</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>5 0.8328433 <a title="390-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood_in_the_math_curriculum.html">992 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood in the math curriculum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to this  interesting article  by Vasik Rajlich and Frederic Friedel.  I find these sorts of things fun to read, but the horrible thing is that I just get worse and worse as a player.  I seem to have lost the ability to automatically filter out the worst moves.  Not that I was ever any good, but now I can’t seem to go five moves without making a major blunder.  I’m seriously thinking about never leaving any pieces unprotected even for a single move, just so I don’t have to worry about forgetting about them.

<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.

Of, if you want to see it in map form, check out  this article  (with Daniel and Yair).
 
P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

I thought you might find data of this quantity and quality as interesting as I do.


In their latest blog entry, okcupid uses its very large dating-site userbase to assess the progression of social and economic views with age, and (taking into account self-specified importance of economic and social views) the resulting political affiliations.  The final assessment is that the spectrum of views encompassed under “democrat” ends up being much broader than those under “republican”.  I’ve seen this mentioned many times before, but I have never seen such pretty data illustrating the phenomenon.  Perhaps this is more graphics to impress, rather than graphics in a typical statistical setting, but I find them captivating nonetheless. In any case, I would be curious to hear your opinions of this.

<p>Introduction: When we suggest a new method, we are duty-bound to not just demonstrate that it works better than existing approaches (or is superior in some other way such as simplicity or cost).  We also need to explain why, if this new method is so great, people aren’t  already  using it.
 
Various answers are possible, for example:
 
- The new idea is technically advanced, requiring a level of mathematical or engineering complexity such that it could not easily have been discovered by accident.  Hence its novelty can be explained as a product of some particular historical process.
 
- The new idea is clever and unexpected, as with the mechanical device underlying Rubik’s Cube.
 
- The new idea could only exist given recent technological developments (perhaps hardware developments such as a new composite material or an ultralight battery, or software developments such as a new MCMC algorithm).
 
- The new idea usually isn’t so impressive but it shows its virtues in some previously hidden domain (fo</p><p>6 0.97981167 <a title="390-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-05-Xiao-Li_Meng_and_Xianchao_Xie_rethink_asymptotics.html">1406 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-05-Xiao-Li Meng and Xianchao Xie rethink asymptotics</a></p>

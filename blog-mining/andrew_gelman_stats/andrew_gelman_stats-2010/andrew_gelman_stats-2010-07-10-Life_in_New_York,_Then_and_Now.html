</p><p>5 Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:      Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school. [sent-7, score-0.31]
</p><p>6 Of the 35 brownstones that lined the block, only seven remain today. [sent-8, score-0.132]
</p><p>7 While any such demolition of livable housing stock would be greeted with cries of horror today from poverty advocates and landmarking experts, the policy was strongly advocated by neighborhood clergy, who had high hopes that the struggling poor could make a better life in public housing. [sent-9, score-1.913]
</p><p>8 ”  What’s awkward about the above paragraph, though, is the phrase “would be greeted with cries of horror today from poverty advocates and landmarking experts. [sent-11, score-1.383]
</p><p>9 ”  So there’s a funny feel to this: on one hand, he’s mocking the opponents of demolition, but at the same time he’s saying demolition was a bad idea and represents “one of the most potent demonstrations of the law of unintended consequences. [sent-13, score-0.645]
</p><p>10 ”   It’s possible to have it both ways–you can both oppose demolition while disagreeing with your allies in this opposition–but, if so, that’s an interesting tension that’s worth exploring. [sent-14, score-0.458]
</p><p>11 My impression is that Podhoretz did not think things through on that level, but rather got off a swipe at “poverty advocates and landmarking experts” without really reflecting on it. [sent-15, score-0.563]
</p><p>12 Perhaps if he expands this essay into something longer, he can explore these political issues in more depth. [sent-16, score-0.134]

</p><p>14 Both these examples come from conservatives, but liberals (and moderates) are certainly not immune to the problem either. [sent-20, score-0.072]

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .


But if Freedom is middlebrow, it is so in the sacrosanct Don DeLillo tradition, which our critical establishment considers central to literature today. . . .

<p>Introduction: Michael Bader writes:
  
 
What is the best way to examine interactions of independent variables in a propensity weights framework?  Let’s say we are interested in estimating breathing difficulty (measured on a continuous scale) and our main predictor is age of housing.  The object is to estimate whether living in housing 20 years or older is associated with breathing difficulty compared counterfactually to those living in housing less than 20 years old; as a secondary question, we want to know whether that effect differs for those in poverty compared to those not in poverty.  In our first-stage propensity model, we include whether the respondent lives in poverty.  The weights applied to the other covariates in the propensity model are similar to those living in poverty compared to those who are not.  Now, can I simply interact the poverty variable with the age of construction variable to look at the interaction of age of housing and poverty on breathing difficulty?  My thought is no —</p><p>4 0.10096861 <a title="139-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Education_and_Poverty.html">560 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Education and Poverty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Livengood writes:
  
There has been some discussion about the recent PISA results (in which the U.S. comes out pretty badly), for example  here  and  here .  The claim being made is that the poor U.S. scores are due to rampant individual- or family-level poverty in the U.S.  They claim that when one controls for poverty, the U.S. comes out on top in the PISA standings, and then they infer that poverty causes poor test scores.  The further inference is then that the U.S. could improve education by the “simple” action of reducing poverty.  Anyway, I was wondering what you thought about their analysis.
  
My reply:  I agree this is interesting and I agree it’s hard to know exactly what to say about these comparisons.  When I’m stuck in this sort of question, I ask, WWJD?  In this case, I think Jennifer would ask what are the potential interventions being considered.

The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . .

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>4 0.79548413 <a title="139-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-03-Objects_of_the_class_%E2%80%9CLawrence_Summers%E2%80%9D%3A__Arne_Duncan_edition.html">2122 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-03-Objects of the class “Lawrence Summers”:  Arne Duncan edition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have a new “ Objects of the class ,” and it’s a good one!
 
Here’s what happened.  I came across a thoughtful  discussion  by Mark Palko of how it was that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ticked off so many people with his recent remarks about “white suburban moms”:
  
To understand why Duncan hit such a nerve, you need to consider the long and complicated role that racial politics have played in this debate.


The public face of the education reform movement has always been pictures of eager young African-American and Hispanic children. Not only has the movement been sold as a way of helping these children but people who object to parts of the reform agenda have often been accused, implicitly or explicitly, of not wanting to help children of color. . . .

<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>6 0.79305845 <a title="139-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-How_to_think_about_Lou_Dobbs.html">335 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-How to think about Lou Dobbs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Perhaps because of  these discussions , I was pointed toward  an article  on “Rethinking Darfur” by Marc Gustafson, which was written up in a news story  here .  From the publicity email:
  
 
This paper is intended to challenge the conventional wisdom about the causes and levels of violence in Darfur during the conflict there. Gustafson, a Marshall Scholar at Oxford, draws on historical analysis, explores mortality surveys, and dissects six years of American budgetary allocations in Sudan, contending that while the war in Darfur has had horrific results, it has been mischaracterized persistently in terms of the scale and causes of the conflict.  Gustafson argues that these mischaracterizations had negative effects on elite and public understanding of the conflict, and consequently had a rather dubious effect on policy choices.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school.

<p>Introduction: AT  writes :
  
Sitting on my [AT's] to-do list for a while now has been an exploration of Scrabble from an experimental design point of view; how to better design a tournament to make the variance as small as possible while still preserving the appearance of the home game to its players. . . . 


I’m proud (relieved?) to say that I’ve finally  finished the first draft  of this work for two-player head-to-head games, with a duplication method that ensures that if the game were repeated, each player would receive tiles from the reserve in the same sequence: think of the tiles being laid out in order (but unseen to the players), so that one player draws from the front and the other draws from the back. . . .


One goal of this was to figure out how much of the variance in score comes from the tile order and how much comes from the board, given that a tile order would be expected. It turns out to be about half-bag, half-board . . .


Some other findings from the simulations:

<p>Introduction: This story  reminds me that, when I was in grad school, the state of Massachusetts instituted a seat-belt law which became a big controversy.  A local talk show host made it his pet project to shoot down the law, and he succeeded!  There was a ballot initiative and the voters repealed the seat belt law.  A few years later the law returned (it was somehow tied in with Federal highway funding, I think, the same way they managed to get all the states to up the drinking age to 21), and, oddly enough, nobody seemed to care the second time around.
 
It’s funny how something can be a big political issue one year and nothing the next.  I have no deep insights on the matter, but it’s worth remembering that these sorts of panics are nothing new.  Recall E.S. Turner’s classic book, Roads to Ruin.  I think there’s a research project in here, to understand what gets an issue to be a big deal and how it is that some controversies just fade away.</p><p>6 0.79055107 <a title="139-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-03-Counting_gays.html">1404 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-03-Counting gays</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Statistics is the science of defaults.
 
One of the differences between statistics and other branches of engineering is that we have a special love for default procedures, perhaps because so many statistical problems are routine (or, at least, people would like them to be).  We have standard estimates for all sorts of models, books of statistical tests, and default settings for everything.  Recently I’ve been working on default weakly informative priors (which are  not  the same as the typically noninformative “reference priors” of the Bayesian literature).  From a Bayesian point of view, the appropriate default procedure could be defined as that which is appropriate for the population of problems that one might be studying.
 
More generally, much of our job as statisticians is to come up with methods that will be used by others in routine practice.  (Much of the rest of our job is to come up with methods for evaluating new and existing statistical methods, and methods for coming up wi</p><p>3 0.15316403 <a title="147-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-16-How_do_we_choose_our_default_methods%3F.html">1859 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-16-How do we choose our default methods?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was asked to write an article for the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) 50th anniversary volume.   Here it is  (it’s labeled as “Chapter 1,” which isn’t right; that’s just what came out when I used the template that was supplied).  The article begins as follows:
  
The field of statistics continues to be divided into competing schools of thought. In theory one might imagine choosing the uniquely best method for each problem as it arises, but in practice we choose for ourselves (and recom- mend to others) default principles, models, and methods to be used in a wide variety of settings. This article briefly considers the informal criteria we use to decide what methods to use and what principles to apply in statistics problems.

<p>Introduction: Leading theoretical statistician Larry Wassserman  in 2008 :  
  
Some of the greatest contributions of statistics to science involve adding additional randomness and leveraging that randomness. Examples are randomized experiments, permutation tests, cross-validation and data-splitting. These are unabashedly frequentist ideas and, while one can strain to fit them into a Bayesian framework, they don’t really have a place in Bayesian inference. The fact that Bayesian methods do not naturally accommodate such a powerful set of statistical ideas seems like a serious deficiency.
  
To which I responded on the second-to-last paragraph of page 8  here .
 
Larry Wasserman in  2013 :
  
Some people say that there is no role for randomization in Bayesian inference. In other words, the randomization mechanism plays no role in Bayes’ theorem. But this is not really true. Without randomization, we can indeed derive a posterior for theta but it is highly sensitive to the prior.

<p>Introduction: Keith O’Rourke and I wrote  an article  that begins:
  
Textbooks on statistics emphasize care and precision, via concepts such as reliability and validity in measurement, random sampling and treatment assignment in data collection, and causal identification and bias in estimation. But how do researchers decide what to believe and what to trust when choosing which statistical methods to use? How do they decide the credibility of methods? Statisticians and statistical practitioners seem to rely on a sense of anecdotal evidence based on personal experience and on the attitudes of trusted colleagues. Authorship, reputation, and past experience are thus central to decisions about statistical procedures.
  
It’s for a volume on theoretical or methodological research on authorship, functional roles, reputation, and credibility in social media, edited by Sorin Matei and Elisa Bertino.</p><p>4 0.71435112 <a title="147-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Felix_Salmon_wins_the_American_Statistical_Association%E2%80%99s_Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">33 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Felix Salmon wins the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The official announcement:
  
The Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award for 2010 is presented to Felix Salmon for his body of work, which exemplifies the highest standards of scientific reporting. His insightful use of statistics as a tool to understanding the world of business and economics, areas that are critical in today’s economy, sets a new standard in statistical investigative reporting.
  
Here are some examples:
 
 Tiger Woods 
 
 Nigerian spammers 
 
 How the government fudges job statistics 
 
This one is important to me.  The idea is that “statistical reporting” is not just traditional science reporting (journalist talks with scientists and tries to understand the consensus) or science popularization or silly feature stories about the lottery.  Salmon is doing investigative reporting using statistical thinking.
 
Also, from a political angle, Salmon’s smart and quantitatively sophisticated work (as well as that of others such as Nate Silver) is an important counterweigh</p><p>5 0.71367311 <a title="147-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Theoretical_vs_applied_statistics.html">498 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Theoretical vs applied statistics</a></p>

I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.

<p>Introduction: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data :
  
We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation</p><p>5 0.99167478 <a title="147-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-20-Adding_more_information_can_make_the_variance_go_up_%28depending_on_your_model%29.html">810 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-20-Adding more information can make the variance go up (depending on your model)</a></p>

In their March 9 “ counterpoint ” in nature biotech to the prospect that we should try to integrate more sources of data in clinical practice (see “ point ” arguing for this), Isaac Kohane and David Margulies claim that,


“Finally, how much better is our new knowledge than older knowledge? When is the incremental benefit of a genomic variant(s) or gene expression profile relative to a family history or classic histopathology insufficient and when does it add rather than subtract variance?”  


Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability. That is, if you have a hierarchical model, and the family history / classical histopathology already suggests a parameter estimate with some variance, how could the new genomic info possibly increase the variance of that parameter estimate? Surely the question is how much variance the new genomic info reduces and whether it therefore justifies t</p><p>6 0.98797637 <a title="147-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-Neumann_update.html">432 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-Neumann update</a></p>

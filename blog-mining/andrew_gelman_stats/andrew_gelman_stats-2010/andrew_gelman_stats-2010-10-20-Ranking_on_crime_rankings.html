I’m surprised the difference is so small.  I would’ve thought the crime rate was something like 5 times higher in Detroit than in Minneapolis.  I guess Minneapolis must have some rough neighborhoods.  Or maybe it’s just that I don’t have a good framework for thinking about crime statistics.</p><p>3 0.31806552 <a title="356-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-05-High_temperatures_cause_violent_crime_and_implications_for_climate_change%2C_also_some_suggestions_about_how_to_better_summarize_these_claims.html">1522 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-05-High temperatures cause violent crime and implications for climate change, also some suggestions about how to better summarize these claims</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following up on  this post  by Noah Smith on economics in science fiction, Mark Palko  writes  on economics in crime fiction.
 
Just as almost all science fiction is ultimately about politics, one could say that just about all crime fiction is about economics.
 
But if I had to pick one crime novelist with an economics focus, Iâ&euro;&trade;d pick George V. Higgins.  In one of his novels, his character Jerry Kennedy had a riff on the difference between guys who get a salary and guys who have to work for every dollar.  But, really, almost all his novels are full of economics.</p><p>5 0.21697186 <a title="356-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-21-Belief_in_hell_is_associated_with_lower_crime_rates.html">1386 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-21-Belief in hell is associated with lower crime rates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):
 
   
 
Anyway, with all this, I was primed to be interested in a recent  study  by psychologist</p><p>6 0.19788063 <a title="356-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-30-Things_I_learned_from_the_Mickey_Kaus_for_Senate_campaign.html">13 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-30-Things I learned from the Mickey Kaus for Senate campaign</a></p>

<p>Introduction: See here  (if you care).
 
P.S.  Kaus writes that, when he was on William Bennett’s radio show, “Bennett immediately zeroed in on a key political mystery: Are African-American voters on board with the Democrats’ recent amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants program?”  I wonder if Kaus asked Bennett about  this quote :
  
But I [Bennett] do know that it’s true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could — if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down. 
  
As Brendan Nyhan notes, Bennett wasn’t actually  suggesting  that black babies be aborted–in fact, Bennett said, “That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down.”  Bennett definitely sounds like the go-to guy for a savvy discussion of the black vote!

<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.

<p>Introduction: Completely non-gay historian Niall Ferguson, a man who  we can be sure  would never be caught at a ballet or a poetry reading,  informs us  that the British decision to enter the first world war on the side of France and Belgium was “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
Ummm, here are a few bigger errors: 
   
The German decision to invade Russia in 1941.
 
The Japanese decision to attack America in 1941.
 
 Oh yeah , the German decision to invade Belgium in 1914.
 
The Russian decision to invade Afghanistan in 1981 doesn’t look like such a great decision either.
 
And it wasn’t so smart for Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, but maybe the countries involved were too small for this to count as “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
It’s striking that, in considering the biggest error in modern history, Ferguson omits all these notorious acts of aggression (bombing Pearl Harbor, leading to the destruction of much of your country, that was pretty bad, huh?), and decides that the worst</p><p>4 0.49435079 <a title="356-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-The_Fixie_Bike_Index.html">1127 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-The Fixie Bike Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>5 0.42855141 <a title="356-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood_in_the_math_curriculum.html">992 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood in the math curriculum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.


I started asking hardcore math people — mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, rocket scientists — if they.’d ever u</p><p>6 0.41686276 <a title="356-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-19-Prose_is_paragraphs%2C_prose_is_sentences.html">1863 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-19-Prose is paragraphs, prose is sentences</a></p>

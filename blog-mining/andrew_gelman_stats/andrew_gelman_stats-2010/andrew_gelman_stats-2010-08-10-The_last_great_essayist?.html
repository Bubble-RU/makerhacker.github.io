</p><p>5 The strange thing about the Janet Malcolm article is that Malcolm is so sympathetic to the killers (or, more specifically, to the ex-wife who made the call; Malcolm doesn’t say much about the actual shooter). [sent-19, score-0.178]
</p><p>6 Simpson didn’t do it), but she definitely seemed to be rooting for the woman to get off, to the extent that she (Malcolm) called up one of the lawyers in the middle of the trial in what looks like an attempt to force a mistrial. [sent-22, score-0.349]
</p><p>7 Malcolm’s main argument seems to be that the woman who ordered the killing was represented by a very good lawyer, but, because of difficulties having to do with other lawyers involved in the case, this super-defender didn’t have a chance to really do his thing and win the case. [sent-23, score-0.257]
</p><p>8 Why am I writing hundreds of words about a months-old magazine article on a year-old court case that wasn’t so remarkable in the first place? [sent-25, score-0.373]
</p><p>9 On the surface, it’s the story of a woman in a difficult situation (an immigrant woman, a doctor, divorced with a young child and trapped in a family feud) who’s been accused of murder, and, as the story goes on, it becomes pretty clear that she actually did it. [sent-36, score-0.531]
</p><p>10 At the next level, it’s a New Journalism-style bit of court reporting, where we are told not just about the facts of the case but also, “Boys on the Bus”-style, about the other reporters and about the journalist’s personal sympathies. [sent-39, score-0.223]
</p><p>11 Finally, amidst the colorful details of the court case, Malcolm occasionally offers a thoughtful reflection on the court system. [sent-41, score-0.338]
</p><p>12 )  Anyway, the point is that I found Malcolm’s article to be thought-provoking throughout, much more than one would expect from the pretty basic story of the crime. [sent-46, score-0.195]
</p><p>13 (Once Malcolm sat in the trial for several weeks and interviewed all the participants, it’s no surprise that she turned it into an article (and maybe, soon, into a book); the real question is why she thought this particular case was worse the effort in the first place. [sent-58, score-0.27]
</p><p>14 Malcolm refers to the well-known idea that all sorts of lawyers can successfully defend an innocent person; what makes a great defense lawyer is the ability to get a guilty person off. [sent-61, score-0.515]
</p><p>15 And, indeed, if there’s a hero in Malcolm’s story, it’s the lawyer for the ex-wife, a man who perhaps can work miracles. [sent-62, score-0.204]
</p><p>16 Any journalist can wring sympathy and a critique of the legal system out of a wrongly-accused person, but a  great  journalist can extract sympathy from someone who’s manifestly guilty. [sent-64, score-0.576]
</p><p>17 Perhaps Malcolm would feel it would be cheating to make her argument in the context of an innocent person wrongly accused, or even in an ambiguous case. [sent-68, score-0.181]
</p><p>18 This reminds me of Malcolm’s most famous article, The Journalist and the Murderer, in which–incredibly (to me)–she was angry at a journalist for deceiving a man who, it turned out, had murdered his entire family! [sent-69, score-0.288]
</p><p>19 Just because there are some awesome lawyers out there, no, I don’t think every killer has the right to Johnny-Cochran-level representation. [sent-73, score-0.194]
</p><p>20 I also don’t approve of a journalist trying to use her influence to throw a monkey wrench into a murder trial. [sent-76, score-0.26]

<p>Introduction: In our recent  discussion  of plagiarism and fake quotes, a commenter points to two recent posts by Mark Liberman ( here  and  here ) where Liberman links to about a zillion cases of journalists publishing quotes that were never said.
 
He goes into some detail about two journalists from the New Yorker:  Jared Diamond, who created quotes from a some dude in Papua New Guinea (ironically, one of Diamond’s accusers here is the widow of Stephen Jay Gould), and Janet Malcolm, who not only apparently falsified quotes by a subject of one of her articles, she also may have faked the notes for her interviews.
 
I didn’t know that particular bit about Janet Malcolm, but I’ve felt very uncomfortable about her ever since she her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.  Between that case and her earlier The Journalist and the Murderer, Malcolm really does seem to have some sort of sympathy for people who kill their family members. She’s a good writer, but I still find</p><p>3 0.358904 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-15-The_it-gets-me-so-angry-I-can%E2%80%99t-deal-with-it_threshold.html">2025 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-15-The it-gets-me-so-angry-I-can’t-deal-with-it threshold</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I happened to be looking at Slate (I know, I know, but I’d already browsed Gawker and I was desperately avoiding doing real work) and came across this  article  by Alice Gregory entitled, “I Read Everything Janet Malcolm Ever Published. I’m in awe of her.”
 
I too think Malcolm is an excellent writer, but (a) I’m not happy that she gets off the hook for  faking quotes , and (b) I’m really really not happy with her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.
 
I just can’t get over that, for some reason.  I can appreciate Picasso’s genius even though he beat his wives or whatever it was he did, I can enjoy the music of Jackson Browne, etc.  But for some reason this Malcolm stuff sticks in my craw.  There’s no deep meaning to this—I recognize it is a somewhat irrational attitude on my part, I just wanted to share it with you.</p><p>4 0.093372501 <a title="197-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>5 0.085590914 <a title="197-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-19-Standardized_writing_styles_and_standardized_graphing_styles.html">1176 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-19-Standardized writing styles and standardized graphing styles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Back in the 1700s—JennyD can correct me if I’m wrong here—there was no standard style for writing.  You could be discursive, you could be descriptive, flowery, or terse.  Direct or indirect, serious or funny.  You could construct a novel out of letters or write a philosophical treatise in the form of a novel.
 
Nowadays there are rules.  You can break the rules, but then you’re Breaking. The. Rules.  Which is a distinctive choice all its own.
 
Consider academic writing.  Serious works of economics or statistics tend to be written in a serious style in some version of plain academic English.  The few exceptions (for example, by Tukey, Tufte, Mandelbrot, and Jaynes) are clearly exceptions, written in styles that are much celebrated but not so commonly followed.
 
A serious work of statistics, or economics, or political science  could  be written in a highly unconventional form (consider, for example, Wallace Shawn’s plays), but academic writers in these fields tend to stick with the sta</p><p>6 0.08483357 <a title="197-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-03-Double_standard%3F__Plagiarizing_journos_get_slammed%2C_plagiarizing_profs_just_shrug_it_off.html">1442 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-03-Double standard?

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes on what seems to be the  topic  of the  week :
  
In reflecting on  Lehrer , I [Kahan] have to wonder why the sanction is so much more severe — basically career “death penalty” subject to parole [I think he means "life imprisonment" --- ed.], I suppose, if he manages decades of “good behavior” — for this science journalist when scholars who stick plagiarized material in their “popular science” writing don’t even get slap on wrist — more like shrug of the shoulders. I do think the behavior is comparable; if anything, it’s probably “less wrong” to make up innocuous filler quotes (the Dylan one is, for sure), then to stick paragraphs of someone else’s writing into a book. But the cause is the same: laziness. (The plagarism I’m talking about is not the sort done by Wegman; its sort done by scholars who use factory production techniques to write popular press books —  teams of research assistants who write memos, which the “author” then knits together & passes off as learne</p><p>3 0.85700148 <a title="197-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-08-Poli_sci_plagiarism_update%2C_and_a_note_about_the_benefits_of_not_caring.html">400 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-08-Poli sci plagiarism update, and a note about the benefits of not caring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>5 0.83625013 <a title="197-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-06-%E2%80%9CAnd_will_pardon_Paul_Claudel%2C_Pardons_him_for_writing_well%E2%80%9D.html">1446 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-06-“And will pardon Paul Claudel, Pardons him for writing well”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In our recent  discussion  of plagiarism and fake quotes, a commenter points to two recent posts by Mark Liberman ( here  and  here ) where Liberman links to about a zillion cases of journalists publishing quotes that were never said.
 
He goes into some detail about two journalists from the New Yorker:  Jared Diamond, who created quotes from a some dude in Papua New Guinea (ironically, one of Diamond’s accusers here is the widow of Stephen Jay Gould), and Janet Malcolm, who not only apparently falsified quotes by a subject of one of her articles, she also may have faked the notes for her interviews.
 
I didn’t know that particular bit about Janet Malcolm, but I’ve felt very uncomfortable about her ever since she her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.  Between that case and her earlier The Journalist and the Murderer, Malcolm really does seem to have some sort of sympathy for people who kill their family members. She’s a good writer, but I still find</p><p>6 0.83545119 <a title="197-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-12-Plagiarists_are_in_the_habit_of_lying.html">1210 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-12-Plagiarists are in the habit of lying</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Philip Cohen  asks , “Why are mothers becoming moms?”  These aren’t just two words for the same thing:  in political terms “mother” is merely descriptive while “mom” is more positive.  Indeed, we speak of “mom and apple pie” as unquestionable American icons.
 
Cohen points out that motherhood is sometimes but not always respected in political discourse:
  
On the one hand, both President Obama and pundit Hilary Rosen have now called motherhood the world’s hardest job. And with the Romneys flopping onto the all-mothers-work bandwagon, it appears we’re reaching a rare rhetorical consensus.


On the other hand, the majority in both major political parties agrees that poor single mothers and their children need one thing above all – a (real) job, one that provides the “dignity of an honest day’s work.” For welfare purposes, taking care of children is not only not the toughest job in the world, it is more akin to nothing at all. When Bill Clinton’s endorsed welfare-to-work he famously decla</p><p>2 0.98953646 <a title="197-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-More_by_Berger_and_me_on_weakly_informative_priors.html">1092 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-More by Berger and me on weakly informative priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.
  
I have a few reactions to this:

<p>Introduction: Someone named James writes: 
  
  
I’m working on a classification task, sentence segmentation.  The classifier algorithm we use (BoosTexter, a boosted learning algorithm) classifies each word independently conditional on its features, i.e. a bag-of-words model, so any contextual clues need to be encoded into the features.  The feature extraction system I am proposing in my thesis uses a heteroscedastic LDA to transform data to produce the features the classifier runs on. The HLDA system has a couple parameters I’m testing, and I’m running a 3×2 full factorial experiment. That’s the background which may or may not be relevant to the question.


The output of each trial is a class (there are only 2 classes, right now) for every word in the dataset.  Because of the nature of the task, one class strongly predominates, say 90-95% of the data.  My question is this: in terms of overall performance (we use F1 score), many of these trials are pretty close together, which leads me to ask whethe</p><p>4 0.98809314 <a title="197-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism_as_a_form_of_voluntarism.html">482 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism as a form of voluntarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  by Alex Tabarrok (following up on an article by Rebecca Solnit) on the continuum between voluntarism (or, more generally, non-cash transactions) and markets with monetary exchange.  I just have a few comments of my own:
 
1.  Solnit writes of “the iceberg economy,” which she characterizes as “based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return . . . the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit.”  I just wonder whether “barter” completely fits in here.  Maybe it depends on context.  Sometimes barter is an informal way of keeping track (you help me and I help you), but in settings of low liquidity I could imagine barter being simply an inefficient way of performing an economic transaction.
 
2.  I am no expert on capitalism but my impression is that it’s not just about “competition and selfishness” but also is related to the</p><p>5 0.98722833 <a title="197-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-04-Wanna_be_the_next_Tyler_Cowen%3F__It%E2%80%99s_not_as_easy_as_you_might_think%21.html">1787 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-04-Wanna be the next Tyler Cowen?

Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

If you’re used to Google upending conventional wisdom, then yesterday’s  interview with Laszlo Bock in the New York Times  did not disappoint. Google has determined that test scores and transcripts are useless because they don’t predict performance among its employees. . . .


I [Loken] am going to assume they’re well aware of the limits of their claim, and instead I’m going say that as readers of the interview we should not lose sight of a fundamental fact -

 
Across a wide variety of employment settings, one of the most robust findings in organizational psychology is that tests of cognitive ability are strong predictors of job performance. If Google has found otherwise, what they have found is that grades and test scores are not predictive of performance at Google. In general, in the workplace tests are still highly predictive of success.

<p>Introduction: Jacob Hartog writes the following in reaction to  my post  on the use of value-added modeling for teacher assessment:
  
What I [Hartog] think has been inadequately discussed is the use of individual model specifications to assign these teacher ratings, rather than the zone of agreement across a broad swath of model specifications.


For example, the model used by NYCDOE doesn’t just control for a student’s prior year test score (as I think everyone can agree is a good idea.) It also assumes that different demographic groups will learn different amounts in a given year, and assigns a school-level random effect. The result is that, as was much ballyhooed at the time of the release of the data,the average teacher rating for a given school is roughly the same, no matter whether the school is performing great or terribly. The headline from this was “excellent teachers spread evenly across the city’s schools,” rather than “the specification of these models assume that excellent teachers are</p><p>3 0.78446168 <a title="315-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-More_on_those_L.A._Times_estimates_of_teacher_effectiveness.html">226 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-More on those L.A. Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>6 0.74370444 <a title="315-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following question from an education researcher:
  
 
I was wondering if I could ask you a question about an HLM model I’m working on.  The basic design is that we have 5 years of 8th grade student achievement data (standardized test scores, this is the dependent variable), 4th grade test scores, demographics (e.g., gender and ethnicity) and status wrt special ed or ELL, etc..  In addition, we have some school- or second-level information such as school averages of the student information, type of school (grade configuration), enrollment and so.  In total there are thousands of students and many schools over the 5 years of information.


The model we’re using is quite parsimonious, using only 7 student-level effects and 4 school-level effects.   What’s puzzling us is that the correlation between predicted and actual is unrealistically high…r=0.999.   We’re using the HPMIXED procedure in SAS but that shouldn’t matter.  By dropping variables, obviously we can get the corre</p><p>2 0.96524376 <a title="315-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-22-Spell-checking_example_demonstrates_key_aspects_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">2182 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-22-Spell-checking example demonstrates key aspects of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the new examples for the third edition of Bayesian Data Analysis is a spell-checking story.   Here it is  (just start at 2/3 down on the first page, with “Spelling correction”).
 
I like this example—it demonstrates the Bayesian algebra, also gives a sense of the way that probability models (both “likelihood” and “prior”) are constructed from existing assumptions and data.  The models aren’t just specified as a mathematical exercise, they represent some statement about reality.  And the problem is close enough to our experience that we can consider ways in which the model can be criticized and improved, all in a simple example that has only three possibilities.</p><p>3 0.96481615 <a title="315-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-16-Another_day%2C_another_plagiarist.html">1266 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-16-Another day, another plagiarist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>4 0.96036589 <a title="315-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-19-Validation_of_Software_for_Bayesian_Models_Using_Posterior_Quantiles.html">1019 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-19-Validation of Software for Bayesian Models Using Posterior Quantiles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love  this stuff :
  
This article presents a simulation-based method designed to establish the computational correctness of software developed to fit a specific Bayesian model, capitalizing on properties of Bayesian posterior distributions. We illustrate the validation technique with two examples. The validation method is shown to find errors in software when they exist and, moreover, the validation output can be informative about the nature and location of such errors. We also compare our method with that of an earlier approach.
  
   
 
   
 
   
 
I hope we can put it into Stan.</p><p>5 0.95815361 <a title="315-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-13-Test_scores_and_grades_predict_job_performance_%28but_maybe_not_at_Google%29.html">1980 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-13-Test scores and grades predict job performance (but maybe not at Google)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Loken  writes :
  
If you’re used to Google upending conventional wisdom, then yesterday’s  interview with Laszlo Bock in the New York Times  did not disappoint. Google has determined that test scores and transcripts are useless because they don’t predict performance among its employees. . . .


I [Loken] am going to assume they’re well aware of the limits of their claim, and instead I’m going say that as readers of the interview we should not lose sight of a fundamental fact -

 
Across a wide variety of employment settings, one of the most robust findings in organizational psychology is that tests of cognitive ability are strong predictors of job performance. If Google has found otherwise, what they have found is that grades and test scores are not predictive of performance at Google. In general, in the workplace tests are still highly predictive of success.
 
  
If all the research says that test scores and grades predict performance, why would the people at Google want to igno</p><p>6 0.95795679 <a title="315-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-04-The_Notorious_N.H.S.T._presents%3A__Mo_P-values_Mo_Problems.html">2281 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-04-The Notorious N.H.S.T. presents:  Mo P-values Mo Problems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It  went pretty well, especially considering it was an  entirely new talk  (even though, paradoxically, all the images were old), and even though I had a tough act to follow:  I came on immediately after an excellent short presentation by Jed Dougherty on some cool information and visualization software that he and his colleagues are building for social workers.
 
The only problems with my were:
 
(a) I planned to elicit more audience involvement but didn’t do it. It would’ve been easy:  at any point I could’ve just paused and had the audience members work in pairs to come up with suggested improvements to any of my graphs.  But I forgot to do it.
 
(b) I went on too long.  The talk was going so well, I didn’t stop.  In retrospect, it would’ve been better to stop earlier.  Better for people to leave the table hungry than stuffed.
 
Also, next time I’ll drop the bit about the nuns-in-prison movies.

<p>Introduction: Red State Blue State:  How Will the U.S. Vote? 
 
It’s the “annual Halloween and pre-election extravaganza” of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and they suggested I could talk on the zombies paper (of course), but I thought the material on voting might be of more general interest.
 
The “How will the U.S. vote?” subtitle was not of my choosing, but I suppose I can add a few slides about the forthcoming election.
 
Fri 29 Oct 2010, 7pm in Ward I, in the basement of the Ward Circle building.
 
Should be fun.  I haven’t been to AU since taking a class there, over 30 years ago.
 
P.S.  It was indeed fun.   Here’s  the talk.

<p>Introduction: At Picnic Cafe, Broadway at 101 St, 6-7pm today.
  
Should we vote even though it probably won’t make a difference? Why is the question “Are we better off now than four years ago?” not an appeal to selfishness? Are Americans as polarized as we think? Come explore these and other questions about voting in America today.
  
It’s the usual stuff but close-up so lots of opportunity to argue and heckle.  No slides or graphs.  My plan is to hand out 30-50 index cards, each with a phrase (for example, “Moderation in the pursuit of moderation is no vice” or “Gerrymandering is good for you” or “How to predict elections”), then participants can call out topics and I’ll yap on them (with discussion) till we run out of time.
 
It’ll be weird to talk without graphs.  We’ll see how it goes.</p><p>3 0.62713611 <a title="376-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive_psychology_research_helps_us_understand_confusion_of_Jonathan_Haidt_and_others_about_working-class_voters.html">1373 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive psychology research helps us understand confusion of Jonathan Haidt and others about working-class voters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s some psychology research that’s relevant to  yesterday’s discussion  on working-class voting.  In  a paper  to appear in the journal  Cognitive Science , Andrei Cimpian, Amanda Brandone, and Susan Gelman write:
  
Generic statements (e.g., “Birds lay eggs”) express generalizations about categories. In this paper, we hypothesized that there is a paradoxical asymmetry at the core of generic meaning, such that these sentences have extremely strong implications but require little evidence to be judged true. Four experiments confirmed the hypothesized asymmetry: Participants interpreted novel generics such as “Lorches have purple feathers” as referring to nearly all lorches, but they judged the same novel generics to be true given a wide range of prevalence levels (e.g., even when only 10% or 30% of lorches had purple feathers). A second hypothesis, also confirmed by the results, was that novel generic sentences about dangerous or distinctive properties would be more acceptable than</p><p>4 0.59843403 <a title="376-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-A_question_about_voting_systems%E2%80%94unrelated_to_U.S._elections%21.html">1566 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-A question about voting systems—unrelated to U.S. elections!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jan Vecer writes about a new voting system that is now being considered in the Czech Republic which faces a political crisis where some elected officials became corrupted: 
  
  
I came across a new suggestion about a voting system. The proposal is that in each electoral district the voter chooses 2 candidates (plus vote), but also chooses one candidate with a minus vote. Two top candidates with the highest vote count (= number of plus votes – number of minus votes) are elected to a parliament. There are 81 districts in total, the parliament would have 162 members if the proposal goes through. The intention of the negative vote is to eliminate controversial candidates. 


Are there any clear advantages over the classical “select one candidate” system? Or disadvantages?
  
Any thoughts on this?  I am not an expert on this topic but maybe some of you are.</p><p>5 0.59498286 <a title="376-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on.

<p>Introduction: When Sonia Sotomayor was nominated for the Supreme Court, and there was some discussion of having 6 Roman Catholics on the court at the same time, I  posted  the following historical graph:
 
 
 
It’s time for an update:
 
 
 
It’s still gonna take awhile for the Catholics to catch up. . . .
 
And this one might be relevant too:
 
 
 
It looks as if Jews and men have been overrepresented, also  Episcopalians  (which, as I noted earlier, are not necessarily considered Protestant in terms of religious doctrine but which I counted as such for the ethnic categorization).  Religion is an interesting political variable because it’s nominally about religious belief but typically seems to be more about ethnicity.</p><p>3 0.87153745 <a title="376-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-01-A_randomized_trial_of_the_set-point_diet.html">1239 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-01-A randomized trial of the set-point diet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).


 Design:  Randomized clinica</p><p>same-blog 4 0.86803484 <a title="376-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-28-My_talk_at_American_University.html">376 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-28-My talk at American University</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Red State Blue State:  How Will the U.S. Vote? 
 
It’s the “annual Halloween and pre-election extravaganza” of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and they suggested I could talk on the zombies paper (of course), but I thought the material on voting might be of more general interest.
 
The “How will the U.S. vote?” subtitle was not of my choosing, but I suppose I can add a few slides about the forthcoming election.
 
Fri 29 Oct 2010, 7pm in Ward I, in the basement of the Ward Circle building.
 
Should be fun.  I haven’t been to AU since taking a class there, over 30 years ago.
 
P.S.  It was indeed fun.   Here’s  the talk.  I did end up briefly describing my zombie research but it didn’t make it into any of the slides.</p><p>5 0.84941244 <a title="376-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-18-Prison_terms_for_financial_fraud%3F.html">420 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-18-Prison terms for financial fraud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My econ dept colleague Joseph Stiglitz  suggests  that financial fraudsters be sent to prison.  He points out that the usual penalty–million-dollar fines–just isn’t enough for crimes whose rewards can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
That all makes sense, but why do the options have to be:
 
1.  No punishment
 
2.  A fine with little punishment or deterrent value
 
3.  Prison. 
 
What’s the point of putting nonviolent criminals in prison?  As I’ve said  before , I’d prefer if the government just took all these convicted thieves’ assets along with 95% of their salary for several years, made them do community service (sorting bottles and cans at the local dump, perhaps; a financier should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc. If restriction of personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, they could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if you are ever more than 3 miles from your home.  And a curfew so you have to stay home bet</p><p>6 0.84253132 <a title="376-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-18-Course_proposal%3A_Bayesian_and_advanced_likelihood_statistical_methods_for_zombies..html">96 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-18-Course proposal: Bayesian and advanced likelihood statistical methods for zombies.</a></p>

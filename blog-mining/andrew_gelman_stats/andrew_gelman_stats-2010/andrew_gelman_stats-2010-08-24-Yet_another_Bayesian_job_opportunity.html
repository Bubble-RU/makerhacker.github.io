I hope you have the time to give me (or to write on your blog) and relatively simple explanation that an advanced layman could understand.
  
My reply:
 
I skimmed the above website but I couldn’t quite see what they do.  My guess is that they use MCMC and also various parametric approximations such as variational Bayes.  They also seem to have something set up for decision analysis.
 
My guess is that, compared to a general-purpose tool such as Stan, this Bayesia software is more accessible to non-academics in particular application areas (in this case, it looks like business marketing).  But I can’t be sure.

Thank you for fulfilling another request of mine almost two years ago. I gave you a job description of a senior Bayesian statistical software developer that I was loooking to hire.  You kindly  posted it  on your site.


THAT EVENING, I received a response from a fellow in Florida who had worked as a C++ programmer for 10+ years and — inexplicably — was now finishing his PhD in Bayesian econometrics.  We hired him and he has done magical things with our software, making estimating hierarchical Bayesian models in “real time” on very large, complex datasets a reality.  He’s a super guy, to boot!  Together with others on our staff, we now have fully parallelized versions of most econometric models working on over 100 cores.

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.

<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>6 0.15788455 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-Bayesian_spam%21.html">635 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-Bayesian spam!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Julie Josse sends along this job announcement:
  
A post-doctoral position is available in the applied mathematics department of Agrocampus Rennes. The postdoc will be funded by the Henri Lebesgue Center (see http://www.lebesgue.fr/) if the application is selected. Applicants are expected to send their application before 31 March 2014.


The research focus is on development of new methods to deal with missing values and their implementation in the free R software to make them available. We study new multiple imputation methods based on principal component methods. 
   
Different aspects are expected to be covered: dealing with missing values in multi-blocks, multi-groups data (groups of individuals and variables); regularization in this framework using a Bayesian approach, dealing with different types of data (continuous, categoricals, etc.). Fields of application are wide and include biological data as well as socio-economic data.

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: I remember in 4th grade or so, the teacher would give us a list of vocabulary words each week and we’d have to show we learned them by using each in a sentence.  We quickly got bored and decided to do the assignment by writing a single sentence using all ten words.  (Which the teacher hated, of course.)
 
The above headline is in that spirit, combining  blog   posts  rather than vocabulary words.
 
But that only uses two of the entries.  To really do the job, I’d need to throw in bivariate associations, ecological fallacies, high-dimensional feature selection, statistical significance, the suddenly unpopular name Hilary, snotty reviewers, the contagion of obesity, and milk-related spam.
 
Or we could bring in some of the all-time favorites, such as Bayesians, economists, Finland, beautiful parents and their daughters, goofy graphics, red and blue states, essentialism in children’s reasoning, chess running, and zombies.  Putting 8 of these in a single sentence (along with Glenn Hubbard</p><p>2 0.97842765 <a title="231-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-31-Untunable_Metropolis.html">833 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-31-Untunable Metropolis</a></p>

What are we to make of it when a Metropolis-Hastings step just won’t tune? That is, the acceptance rate is zero at expected-jump-size X, and way above 1/2 at X-exp(-16) (i.e.,  machine precision ).


I’ve solved my practical problem by writing that I would have liked to include results from a diffuse prior, but couldn’t. But I’m bothered by the poverty of my intuition. And since everything I’ve read says this is an issue of efficiency, rather than accuracy, I wonder if I could solve it just by running massive and heavily thinned chains.
  
My reply:
 
I can’t see how this could happen in a well-specified problem!  I suspect it’s a bug.  Otherwise try rescaling your variables so that your parameters will have values on the order of magnitude of 1.
 
To which Margolis responded:
  
I hardly wrote any of the code, so I can’t speak to the bug question — it’s binomial kriging from the R package geoRglm. And there are no covariates to scale — just the zero and one</p><p>3 0.97289121 <a title="231-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-10-He_said_he_was_sorry.html">1756 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-10-He said he was sorry</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When I spoke at Princeton last year, I talked with neuroscientist Sam Wang, who told me about a project he did surveying incoming Princeton freshmen about mental illness in their families.  He and his coauthor Benjamin Campbell found some interesting results, which they just  published :
  
A link between intellect and temperament has long been the subject of speculation. . . . Studies of the artistically inclined report linkage with familial depression, while among eminent and creative scientists, a lower incidence of affective disorders is found. In the case of developmental disorders, a heightened prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been found in the families of mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. . . .


We surveyed the incoming class of 2014 at Princeton University about their intended academic major, familial incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders, and demographic variables. . . . Consistent with prior findings, we noticed a relation between intended academ</p><p>5 0.96546924 <a title="231-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-16-The_%E2%80%9Chot_hand%E2%80%9D_and_problems_with_hypothesis_testing.html">1215 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-16-The “hot hand” and problems with hypothesis testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>3 0.10630821 <a title="374-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Doug_Hibbs_on_the_fundamentals_in_2010.html">292 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Doug Hibbs on the fundamentals in 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010.

<p>Introduction: They  write :
  
How many House seats will the Republicans gain in 2010? . . . Our methodology replicates that for our ultimately successful forecast of the 2006 midterm. Two weeks before Election Day in 2006, we posted  a prediction that the Democrats would gain 32 seats and recapture the House majority. The Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006. Our current forecast for 2010 shows that the Republicans are likely to regain the House majority. . . . the most likely scenario is  a Republican majority in the neighborhood of 229 seats versus 206 for the Democrats for a 50-seat loss for the Democrats .
  
How do they do it?  First, they predict the national two-party vote using the generic polls (asking voters which party they plan to vote for in the November congressional elections).  Then they apply the national vote swing on a district-by-district level to predict the outcome in each district.  They account for uncertainty in their predictions (I assume by using a model similar to what  Gar</p><p>5 0.10112116 <a title="374-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-Blending_results_from_two_relatively_independent_multi-level_models.html">250 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-Blending results from two relatively independent multi-level models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Shor writes:
  
 
I [Shor] am working on a Bayesian Forecasting model for the Mid-term elections that has two components:


1) A poll aggregation system with pooled and hierarchical house and design effects across every race with polls (Average Standard error for house seat level vote-share ~.055)


2) A Bafumi-style regression that applies national-swing to individual seats. (Average Standard error for house seat level vote-share ~.06)


Since these two estimates are essentially independent, estimates can probably be made more accurate by pooling them together. But If a house effect changes in one draw, that changes estimates in every race. Changes in regression coefficients and National swing have a similar effect.  In the face of high and possibly differing seat-to-seat correlations from each method, I’m not sure what the correct way to “blend” these models would be, either for individual or top-line seat estimates.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>4 0.5563103 <a title="374-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Doug_Hibbs_on_the_fundamentals_in_2010.html">292 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Doug Hibbs on the fundamentals in 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As I  wrote  a couple years ago:
  
Even though statistical analysis has demonstrated that presidential elections are predictable given economic conditions and previous votes in the states . . . it certainly doesn’t mean that every election can be accurately predicted ahead of time.  Presidential general election campaigns have several distinct features that distinguish them from most other elections:


1.  Two major candidates; 
2.  The candidates clearly differ in their political ideologies and in their positions on economic issues; 
3.  The two sides have roughly equal financial and organizational resources; 
4.  The current election is the latest in a long series of similar contests (every four years); 
5.  A long campaign, giving candidates a long time to present their case and giving voters a long time to make up their minds.


Other elections look different. . . .
  
Or, as I  said  in reference to the current NYC mayoral election:

<p>Introduction: As a matter of convention, we usually run 3 or 4 chains in JAGS. By default, this gives rise to chains that draw samples from 3 or 4 distinct pseudorandom number generators. I didn’t go and check whether it does things 111,222,333 or 123,123,123, but in any event the “parallel chains” in JAGS are samples drawn from distinct RNGs computed on a single processor core.
  But we all have multiple cores now, or we’re computing on a cluster or the cloud! So the behavior we’d like from  rjags  is to use the  foreach  package with each JAGS chain using a parallel-safe RNG. The default behavior with  n.chain=1  will be that each parallel instance will use  .RNG.name[1] , the Wichmann-Hill RNG. 
  JAGS 2.2.0 includes a new  lecuyer  module (along with the  glm  module, which everyone should probably always use, and doesn’t have many undocumented tricks that I know of).  But lecuyer is completely undocumented!  I tried  .RNG.name="lecuyer::Lecuyer" ,  .RNG.name="lecuyer::lecuyer" , and  .RNG.name=</p><p>3 0.80363274 <a title="374-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-Deviance_as_a_difference.html">729 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-Deviance as a difference</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peng Yu writes:
  
On page 180 of BDA2, deviance is defined as  D(y,\theta)=-2log p(y|\theta).  However, according to GLM 2/e by McCullagh and Nelder, deviance is the different of the log-likelihood of the full model and the base model (times 2) (see the equation on the wiki webpage). The english word ‘deviance’ implies the difference from a standard (in this case, 
the base model).  I’m wondering what the rationale for your definition of deviance, which consists of only 1 term rather than 2 terms.
  
My reply:
 
Deviance is typically computed as a relative quantity; that is, people look at the difference in deviance.  So the two definitions are equivalent.</p><p>4 0.77910292 <a title="374-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-08-The_Supreme_Court_meets_the_fallacy_of_the_one-sided_bet.html">1793 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-08-The Supreme Court meets the fallacy of the one-sided bet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.  Even among scientists, there’s</p><p>5 0.76971018 <a title="374-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-16-Memo_to_Reinhart_and_Rogoff%3A__I_think_it%E2%80%99s_best_to_admit_your_errors_and_go_on_from_there.html">1805 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-16-Memo to Reinhart and Rogoff:  I think it’s best to admit your errors and go on from there</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Ratto points me to  this  news article by Dean Baker reporting the work of three economists, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who  found  errors in a much-cited  article  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff analyzing historical statistics of economic growth and public debt.  Mike Konczal  provides  a clear summary; that’s where I got the above image.
 
 Errors in data processing and data analysis 
 
It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff flubbed it.  Herndon et al. write of “spreadsheet errors, omission of available data, weighting, and transcription.”  The spreadsheet errors are the most embarrassing, but the other choices in data analysis seem pretty bad too.  It can be tough to work with small datasets, so I have sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, but it does look like they were jumping to conclusions in their paper.  Perhaps the urgency of the topic moved them to publish as fast as possible rather than carefully considering the impact of their data-analytic choi</p><p>6 0.74003458 <a title="374-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-12-Human_nature_can%E2%80%99t_be_changed_%28except_when_it_can%29.html">707 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-12-Human nature can’t be changed (except when it can)</a></p>

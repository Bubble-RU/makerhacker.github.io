<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .
  
OK, fine, so individual creatives aren’t doing so well?  But what about the larger urban economies?  P</p><p>3 0.12421377 <a title="203-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-14-On_blogging.html">2023 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-14-On blogging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From 1982:
  
The necessary conceit of the essayist must be that in writing down what is obvious to him he is not wasting his reader’s time.  The value of what he does will depend on the quality of his perception, not on the length of his manuscript.  Too many dull books about literature would have been tolerably long essays; too many dull long essays would have been reasonably interesting short ones; too many short essays should have been letters to the editor.  If the essayist has a literary personality his essay will add up to something all of a piece.  If he has not, he may write fancily titled books until doomsday and do no good.  Most of the criticism that matters at all has been written in essay form.  This fact is no great mystery:  what there is to say about literature is very important, but there just isn’t all that much of it.  Literature says most things itself, when it is allowed to.

<p>Introduction: In an article provocatively entitled, “Will Ohio State’s football team decide who wins the White House?”, Tyler Cowen and Kevin Grier  report :
  
It is statistically possible that the outcome of a handful of college football games in the right battleground states could determine the race for the White House.


Economists Andrew Healy, Neil Malhotra, and Cecilia Mo make this argument in a fascinating article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. They examined whether the outcomes of college football games on the eve of elections for presidents, senators, and governors affected the choices voters made. They found that a win by the local team, in the week before an election, raises the vote going to the incumbent by around 1.5 percentage points. When it comes to the 20 highest attendance teams—big athletic programs like the University of Michigan, Oklahoma, and Southern Cal—a victory on the eve of an election pushes the vote for the incumbent up by 3 percentage points.

<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>6 0.077073857 <a title="203-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-04-More_on_the_economic_benefits_of_universities.html">1153 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-04-More on the economic benefits of universities</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I happened to come across a little book, “Current Glossary:  Words Coined Since the War.”  Here are some of them:
 
as’pi-rin, n.  A white compound used as a drug in the cure of headaches and rheumatism.
 
bob’go, n.  A kind of antelope in Africa; its meat is good for food.
 
cat’ta-lo, n.  A cross between an American bison and a cow.
 
dart, n.  A short, pointed spear-like weapon of steel dropped by airmen in attacks on the enemy.
 
free’lance, n.  A rover in literature, a writer not in the employ of one firm.
 
griz’zly bear.  A new kind of dance.
 
You get the idea.

<p>Introduction: Hermann Goering is famous for two things:
 
1.  Being an air force general, and
 
2.  Being a really bad air force general.
 
What does this have to do, you may ask, with Jane Jacobs, who is famous for a book she wrote in the early 1960s advocating small, mixed-use street-level city development, in contrast to the mega-projects that were advocated by many influential planners at the time.
 
The connection is, as a London-based friend pointed out to me the other day, that the German bombing of London in WW2 knocked out random sections all over the city, which were then often replaced by various public developments.  The knocked-out portions were often small, so there was not always room for megablocks to replace them, and they were scattered—so the new housing was also distributed haphazardly all over the city.
 
Thus, Goering helped in two ways, corresponding to the two numbered points listed above:
 
1.  His air force dropped bombs and destroyed buildings all over London.
 
2.  His at</p><p>4 0.85459185 <a title="203-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-26-Prolefeed.html">4 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-26-Prolefeed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Anthony Burgess’s review of “The Batsford Companion to Popular Literature,” by Victor Neuberg:
  
Arthur J. Burks (1898-1974) was no gentleman.  During the 1930s, when he would sometimes have nearly two million words in current publication, he aimed at producing 18,000 words a day.

 
Editors would call me up and ask me to do a novelette by the next afternoon, and I would, but it nearly killed me. . . .  I once appeared on the covers of eleven magazines the same month, and then almost killed myself for years trying to make it twelve.  I never did.
 

[Masanao:   I think you know where I'm heading with that story.]


Ursula Bloom, born 1985 and still with us [this was written sometime between 1978 and 1985], is clearly no lady.  Writing also under the pseudonyms of Lozania Prole (there’s an honest name for you), Sheila Burnes and Mary Essex, she has produced 486 boooks, beginning with  Tiger  at the age of seven. . . .

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>6 0.83461666 <a title="203-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-Whassup_with_those_crappy_thrillers%3F.html">115 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-Whassup with those crappy thrillers?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This conference touches nicely on many of the more Biostatistics related topics that have come up on this blog from a pragmatic and perceptive Bayesian perspective.
 
 Fourth Annual Bayesian Biostatistics Conference 
 
Including the star of that recent Cochrane TV debate who will be the key note speaker. 
 
See here  Subtle statistical issues to be debated on TV.  and perhaps the last comment which is my personal take on that debate.

<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>3 0.88595128 <a title="203-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-Estimating_seasonality_with_a_data_set_that%E2%80%99s_just_52_weeks_long.html">1513 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-Estimating seasonality with a data set that’s just 52 weeks long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>4 0.87252176 <a title="203-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-Statistical_fact_checking_needed%2C_or%2C_No%2C_Ronald_Reagan_did_not_win_%E2%80%9Coverwhelming_support_from_evangelicals%E2%80%9D.html">143 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-Statistical fact checking needed, or, No, Ronald Reagan did not win “overwhelming support from evangelicals”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>5 0.86226571 <a title="203-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project_qualifying_exam_process%3A__An_intensified_dialogue_between_students_and_faculty.html">308 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project qualifying exam process:  An intensified dialogue between students and faculty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>6 0.85695231 <a title="203-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-09-Experimental_work_on_market-based_or_non-market-based_incentives.html">1410 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-09-Experimental work on market-based or non-market-based incentives</a></p>

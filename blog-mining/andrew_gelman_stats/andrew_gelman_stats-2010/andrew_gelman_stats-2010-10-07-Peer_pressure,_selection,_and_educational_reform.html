<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>3 0.12453963 <a title="326-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-14-Questions_about_a_study_of_charter_schools.html">957 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-14-Questions about a study of charter schools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Phil Harris and Bruce Smith write:
  
We have only recently chanced upon your blog while we were looking for responses to the “decline effect” in medical and scientific studies. We were especially taken by your comment that there is something wrong with the scientific method “if this method is defined as running experiments and doing data analysis in a patternless way and then reporting, as true, results that pass a statistical significance threshold.” To us, that seems to be standard operating procedure in much of social science, including our own field of education. Indeed quasi-experimental designs are the stock in trade of those who attempt to use “science” — we dare not say haruspicy, but you can if you like — to influence the course of public policy.


Now, a new entrant into the cherry pickers sweepstakes seems to have emerged. It is on  Charter School Performance in Indiana Schools .

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>3 0.85258138 <a title="326-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Why_girls_do_better_in_school.html">1803 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Why girls do better in school</a></p>

Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>2 0.96776938 <a title="326-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-How_to_think_about_Lou_Dobbs.html">335 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-How to think about Lou Dobbs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>3 0.96438742 <a title="326-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-20-Stan_at_Google_this_Thurs_and_at_Berkeley_this_Fri_noon.html">1772 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-20-Stan at Google this Thurs and at Berkeley this Fri noon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: Congressman  Kevin Brady  from Texas  distributes this visualization of reformed  health care  in the US (click for a bigger picture):
 
   
 
Here’s a  PDF  at Brady’s page, and a local  copy  of it.
 
Complexity has its costs. Beyond the cost of writing it, learning it, following it, there’s also the cost of checking it. John Walker has some  funny examples  of what’s hidden in the almost 8000 pages of IRS code.
 
Text mining and applied statistics will solve all that, hopefully. Anyone interested in developing a pork detection system for the legislation? Or an analysis of how much entropy to the legal code did each congressman contribute?
 
There are already  spin   detectors , that help you detect whether the writer is a Democrat (“stimulus”, “health care”) or a Republican (“deficit spending”, “ObamaCare”).

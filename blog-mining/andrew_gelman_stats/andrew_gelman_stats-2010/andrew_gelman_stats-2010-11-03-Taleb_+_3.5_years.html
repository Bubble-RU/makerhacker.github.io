</p><p>7 They have an incentive to ignore those black swans, since others will pick up the tab when they fail (sort of like FEMA pays for those beachfront houses in Florida). [sent-16, score-0.248]

</p><p>16 All in all, it was probably better for me to just lose the money and maintain a healthy humility about my investment expertise. [sent-36, score-0.492]
</p><p>17 From the General Social Survey  cumulative file, here’s the crosstab of the responses to “Abortion if woman wants for any reason” and “Favor or oppose death penalty for murder”:       40% supported abortion for any reason. [sent-39, score-0.604]
</p><p>18 60% did not support abortion under all conditions. [sent-41, score-0.199]

</p><p>20 Also, he deserves full credit for getting things right several years ago, back when the Larry Summerses of the world were still floating on air, buoyed by the heads-I-win, tails-you-lose system that kept the bubble inflated for so long. [sent-45, score-0.196]

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there.  As I  wrote  a couple years ago, it’s usually presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
For example, Nassim Taleb has a  webpage  that includes a bunch of one-line bits of advice (scroll to item 132 on the linked page).  Here’s his final piece of advice:
  
If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.
  
I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.  I’ve been in environments where people follow Taleb’s advice, saying nothing and occasionally trying to “eliminate” people, and it’s not pretty.

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.

<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.

Arthur J. Burks (1898-1974) was no gentleman.  During the 1930s, when he would sometimes have nearly two million words in current publication, he aimed at producing 18,000 words a day.

 
Editors would call me up and ask me to do a novelette by the next afternoon, and I would, but it nearly killed me. . . .  I once appeared on the covers of eleven magazines the same month, and then almost killed myself for years trying to make it twelve.  I never did.
 

[Masanao:   I think you know where I'm heading with that story.]


Ursula Bloom, born 1985 and still with us [this was written sometime between 1978 and 1985], is clearly no lady.  Writing also under the pseudonyms of Lozania Prole (there’s an honest name for you), Sheila Burnes and Mary Essex, she has produced 486 boooks, beginning with  Tiger  at the age of seven. . . .

<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.


Specifically, the so-called P value — a mathematical measure of the strength of the evidence that there’s a true difference between a treatment and placebo — was 0.08. . . . Technically, the study was a bust, although the results leaned toward a benefit from interferon gamma-1b. Was there a group of patients in which the results tipped?

In  this paper  by Sunjin Ahn, Anoop Korattikara, and Max Welling and  this paper  by Welling and Yee Whye The, there are some arguments on big data and the use of MCMC. Both papers have suggested improvements to speed up MCMC computations. I was wondering what your thoughts were, especially on this paragraph:

 
When a dataset has a billion data-cases (as is not uncommon these days) MCMC algorithms will not even have generated a single (burn-in) sample when a clever learning algorithm based on stochastic gradients may already be making fairly good predictions. In fact, the intriguing results of Bottou and Bousquet (2008) seem to indicate that in terms of “number of bits learned per unit of computation”, an algorithm as simple as stochastic gradient descent is almost optimally efficient. We therefore argue that for Bayesian methods to remain useful in an age when the datasets grow at an exponential rate, they need to embrace the ideas of the stochastic optimiz</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94967008 <a title="392-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-03-Taleb_%2B_3.5_years.html">392 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-03-Taleb + 3.5 years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently had the occasion to reread  my review  of The Black Swan, from April 2007.
 
It was fun reading my review (and also  this pre-review ; “nothing useful escapes from a blackbody,” indeed).  It was like a greatest hits of all my pet ideas that I’ve never published.
 
Looking back, I realize that Taleb really was right about a lot of things.  Now that the financial crisis has happened, we tend to forget that the experts who Taleb bashes were  not  always reasonable at all.  Here’s what I wrote in my review, three and a half years ago:
  
On page 19, Taleb refers to the usual investment strategy (which I suppose I actually use myself) as “picking pennies in front of a steamroller.” That’s a cute phrase; did he come up with it? I’m also reminded of the famous Martingale betting system. Several years ago in a university library I came across a charming book by Maxim (of gun fame) where he went through chapter after chapter demolishing the Martingale system.

A most recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine published a study entitled  “Biventricular Pacing for Atrioventricular Block and Systolic Dysfunction,” (N Engl J Med 2013; 368:1585-1593), whereby “A hierarchical Bayesian proportional-hazards model was used for analysis of the primary outcome.” It is the first study I can recall in this journal that has reported on Table 2 (primary outcomes) “The Posterior Probability of Hazard Ratio < 1" (which in this case was .9978).
  
This is ok, but to be really picky I will say that there’s typically not so much reason to care about the posterior probability that the effect is greater than 1; I’d rather have an estimate of the effect.

<p>Introduction: A University of Delaware press release  reports :
  
This month, the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports will feature the article “An Estimate of How Hitting, Pitching, Fielding, and Base-stealing Impact Team Winning Percentages in Baseball.”  In it, University of Delaware Prof. Charles Pavitt of the Department of Communication defines the perfect “formula” for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams to use to build the ultimate winning team.


Pavitt found hitting accounts for more than 45 percent of teams’ winning records, fielding for 25 percent and pitching for 25 percent. And that the impact of stolen bases is greatly overestimated.


He crunched hitting, pitching, fielding and base-stealing records for every MLB team over a 48-year period from 1951-1998 with a method no other researcher has used in this area. In statistical parlance, he used a conceptual decomposition of offense and defense into its component parts and then analyzed recombinations of the parts in intuitively mea</p><p>6 0.9390626 <a title="392-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-The_placebo_effect_in_pharma.html">388 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-The placebo effect in pharma</a></p>

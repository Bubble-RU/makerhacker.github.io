<p>Introduction: As we get more data, we can fit more model.  But at some point we become so overwhelmed by data that, for computational reasons, we can barely do anything at all.  Thus, the curve above could be thought of as the product of two curves:  a steadily increasing curve showing the  statistical  ability to fit more complex models with more data, and a steadily decreasing curve showing the  computational  feasibility of doing so.</p><p>3 0.12074624 <a title="447-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-16-Update_on_the_generalized_method_of_moments.html">519 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-16-Update on the generalized method of moments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading all the comments  here  I remembered that I’ve actually written  a paper  on the generalized method of moments–including the bit about maximum likelihood being a special case.  The basic idea is simple enough that it must have been rediscovered dozens of times by different people (sort of like the  trapezoidal rule ).
 
In our case, we were motivated to (independently) develop the (well-known, but not by me) generalized method of moments as a way of specifying an indirectly-parameterized prior distribution, rather than as a way of estimating parameters from direct data.  But the math is the same.</p><p>4 0.11811539 <a title="447-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-%E2%80%9CRoughly_90%25_of_the_increase_in_._._.%E2%80%9D__Hey%2C_wait_a_minute%21.html">549 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-“Roughly 90% of the increase in . . .”  Hey, wait a minute!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  links  approvingly to the following  statement  by Michael Mandel:
  
Homeland Security accounts for roughly 90% of the increase in federal regulatory employment over the past ten years.
  
Roughly 90%, huh?  That sounds pretty impressive.  But wait a minute . . . what if total federal regulatory employment had increased a bit less.  Then Homeland Security could’ve accounted for 105% of the increase, or 500% of the increase, or whatever.  The point is the change in total employment is the sum of a bunch of pluses and minuses.  It happens that, if you don’t count Homeland Security, the total hasn’t changed much–I’m assuming Mandel’s numbers are correct here–and that could be interesting.
 
The “roughly 90%” figure is misleading because, when written as a percent of the total increase, it’s natural to quickly envision it as a percentage that is bounded by 100%. There is a total increase in regulatory employment that the individual agencies sum to, but some margins are p</p><p>5 0.10431424 <a title="447-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-21-Stan_Model_of_the_Week%3A_Hierarchical_Modeling_of_Supernovas.html">2299 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-21-Stan Model of the Week: Hierarchical Modeling of Supernovas</a></p>

“Core-collapse supernovae, the luminous explosions of massive stars, exhibit an expansive and meaningful diversity of behavior in their brightness evolution over time (their “light curves”). Our group discovers and monitors these events using the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii, and we’ve collected a dataset of about 20,000 individual photometric observations of about 80 Type IIP supernovae, the class my work has focused on. While this dataset provides one of the best available tools to infer the explosion properties of these supernovae, due to the nature of extragalactic astronomy (observing from distances

<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya. We think it’s a remarkable mode</p><p>3 0.69073999 <a title="447-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-27-Geophysicist_Discovers_Modeling_Error_%28in_Economics%29.html">976 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-27-Geophysicist Discovers Modeling Error (in Economics)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Continuing “heckle the press” month here at the blog, I (Bob) found the following “discovery” a little overplayed by  David H. Freedman , who was writing for  Scientific American  in the following article and blog post:
  
 Blog:  Why Economic Models are Always Wrong 
  Article:  A Formula for Economic Calamity 
   
The article’s paywalled, but the blog entry isn’t.  Apparently, a geophysicist named Jonathan Carter (good luck finding him on the web given only that information) found that when he simulated from a complicated model, then fit the model to the simulated data, he sometimes got different results.  What’s more, these differing estimates fit the data equally well but made different predictions on new data.  Now we don’t know if the model was identifiable, had different local optima (i.e., multiple modes), how he fit the data, or really anything, but it doesn’t really matter.

For my thesis I studied Korean-Americans in education in the health professions through a comparison of Asian ethnic representation in Los Angeles-area medical and dental schools. 


I did this by counting up different Asian ethnic groups at UC Irvine, USC and Loma Linda University’s medical/dental schools using surnames as an identifier (I coded for ethnicity using an algorithm from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries which correlated surnames with ethnicity: http://www.naaccr.org/Research/DataAnalysisTools.aspx). The coding was mostly easy, since “Nguyen” and “Tran” is always Vietnamese, “Kim” and “Song” is Korean, “Shimazaki” is Japanese, etc.

Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero. The allowance for “uphill” moves saves the method from becoming stuck at local minima—which are the bane of greedier methods.
  
And here’s Wegman:
  
During each step of the algorithm, the variable that will eventually represent the minimum is replaced by a random solution that is chosen according to a temperature</p><p>6 0.66987604 <a title="447-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-29-Bayesian_Uncertainty_Quantification_for_Differential_Equations%21.html">2311 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-29-Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Differential Equations!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Posted by Phil Price:
 
 A blogger  (can’t find his name anywhere on his blog) points to  an article  in the medical literature in 1994 that is…well, it’s shocking, is what it is.  This is from the abstract:
  
In Tai’s Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method (less than +/- 0.4%). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin
  
Yes, that’s right, this guy has rediscovered the trapezoidal rule.  You know, that thing most readers of this blog were taught back in 1</p><p>2 0.96106124 <a title="447-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Of_forecasts_and_graph_theory_and_characterizing_a_statistical_method_by_the_information_it_uses.html">1214 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Of forecasts and graph theory and characterizing a statistical method by the information it uses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta points me to  “EigenBracket 2012: Using Graph Theory to Predict NCAA March Madness Basketball”  and writes, “I [Folta] have got to believe that he’s simply re-invented a statistical method in a graph-ish context, but don’t know enough to judge.”
 
I have not looked in detail at the method being presented here—I’m not much of college basketball fan—but I’d like to use this as an excuse to make one of my favorite general point, which is that a good way to characterize any statistical method is by what information it uses. 
   
The basketball ranking method here uses score differentials between teams in the past season.  On the plus side, that is better than simply using one-loss records (which (a) discards score differentials and (b) discards information on who played whom).  On the minus side, the method appears to be discretizing the scores (thus throwing away information on the exact score differential) and doesn’t use any external information such as external ratings.

<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>4 0.94970691 <a title="447-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-19-Validation_of_Software_for_Bayesian_Models_Using_Posterior_Quantiles.html">1019 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-19-Validation of Software for Bayesian Models Using Posterior Quantiles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love  this stuff :
  
This article presents a simulation-based method designed to establish the computational correctness of software developed to fit a specific Bayesian model, capitalizing on properties of Bayesian posterior distributions. We illustrate the validation technique with two examples. The validation method is shown to find errors in software when they exist and, moreover, the validation output can be informative about the nature and location of such errors. We also compare our method with that of an earlier approach.

<p>Introduction: Colleen Ganley, Leigh Mingle, Allison Ryan, Katherine Ryan, Marian Vasilyeva, and Michelle Perry  write :
  
Stereotype threat has been proposed as 1 potential explanation for the gender difference in standardized mathematics test performance among high-performing students. At present, it is not entirely clear how susceptibility to stereotype threat develops, as empirical evidence for stereotype threat effects across the school years is inconsistent. In a series of 3 studies, with a total sample of 931 students, we investigated stereotype threat effects during childhood and adolescence. Three activation methods were used, ranging from implicit to explicit. Across studies, we found no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat. In 2 of the studies, there were gender differences on the mathematics assessment regardless of whether stereotype threat was activated. Potential reasons for these findings are discussed, including the possibil</p><p>3 0.10651748 <a title="129-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk_update.html">497 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk update</a></p>

As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.

I don’t know anything about the internet biz.

<p>Introduction: This time on a NY-Cincinnati roundtrip.  Hipmunk could find the individual flights but could not put them together.  In contrast, Expedia got it right the first time.
 
See  here  and  here  for background.  If anybody reading this knows David Pogue, please let him know about this.

<p>Introduction: Brendan pointed me to  this  news article by David Pogue promoting a website called  Hipmunk , a sleek competitor to Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, and the like.
 
Coincidentally, I had to a buy a flight  right now  so I followed the link and found that, indeed, Hipmunk is about a zillion times easier to use and more impressive than Expedia or even Kayak.  It’s awesome.  The others aren’t even close.  The display was so clean and effective, I felt like ordering a few flights just for fun.
 
That’s the good news.  Now the bad news.  I wasn’t just playing around with the site.  There was actually a flight I wanted to buy–an itinerary I’d looked into yesterday but hadn’t saved or booked.  I effortlessly set up the request in Hipmunk, scanned its impressive graphical display, and . . . couldn’t find the flight I wanted!  Oh no!  The last ticket must’ve been sold!
 
Just to check, though, I want on good old ugly Expedia.  And my flight was right there!  So I bought it.
 
So, just a quick memo</p><p>5 0.67241734 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk_update.html">497 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Another stereotype is affirmed when I go on the U.K. rail system webpage and it repeatedly times out on me.  At one point I have a browser open with the itinerary I’m interested in, and then awhile later I reopen the window (not clicking on anything on the page, just bringing the window up on the screen) but it’s timed out again.
 
P.S.  Yes, yes, I know that Amtrak is worse.  Still, it’s amusing to see a confirmation that, at least in one respect, the British trains are as bad as they say.</p><p>2 0.87036836 <a title="129-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-24-Hey%E2%80%94has_anybody_done_this_study_yet%3F.html">1546 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-24-Hey—has anybody done this study yet?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  suggested  a research project to study how Americans define themselves in terms of regional identity.  For example, if you grew up in South Dakota but live in Washington, D.C., do you you call yourself a midwesterner, a westerner, a southerner, or what?  The analogy is to the paper by Michael Hout on “How 4 million Irish immigrants became 40 million Irish Americans.” Contrary to expectations, it wasn’t about prolific breeding, it was about how people of mixed background choose to classify themselves.</p><p>3 0.86371851 <a title="129-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-GLM_%E2%80%93_exposure.html">271 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-GLM – exposure</a></p>

I am relatively new to glm models, anyhow, I am currently using your book “Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models” (pages 109-115). I am using a Poisson GLM model to analyse an aerial census dataset of wild herbivores on a ranch in Kenya. In my analysis I have the following variables:


 1. Outcome variable: count of wild herbivores sighted at a given location


 2. Explanatory variable1: vegetation type i.e. type of vegetation of the grid in which animals were sighted (the ranch is divided into 1x1km grids)


 3. Explanatory variable2: animal species e.g. eland, elephant, zebra etc


 4. Exposure: proximity to water i.e. distance (km) to the nearest water point


My questions are as follows:


1. Am I correct to include proximity to water point as an offset? I notice that in the example in your book the offset is a count, does this matter?


2. By including proximity to water in the model as an exposure am I correct to interpret th</p><p>4 0.83534765 <a title="129-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-13-Retro_ethnic_slurs.html">1457 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-13-Retro ethnic slurs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Watership Down:
  
There is a rabbit saying, ‘In the warren, more stories than passages’; and a rabbit can no more refuse to tell a story than an Irishman can refuse to fight.
  
Wow. OK, if someone made a joke about New Yorkers being argumentative or people from Iowa being boring (sorry, Tom!), I wouldn’t see it as being in poor taste.  But somehow, to this non-U.K. reader, Adams’s remark about “Irishmen” seems a bit over the top.  I’m not criticizing it as offensive, exactly; it just is a bit jarring, and it’s kind of hard for me to believe someone would just write that as a throwaway line anymore.  Things have changed a lot since 1971, I guess, or maybe in England an Irish joke is no more offensive/awkward than a joke about corrupt Chicagoans, loopy Californians, or crazy Floridians would be here.</p><p>5 0.80442667 <a title="129-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-16-%E2%80%9CNightshifts_Linked_to_Increased_Risk_for_Ovarian_Cancer%E2%80%9D.html">1766 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-16-“Nightshifts Linked to Increased Risk for Ovarian Cancer”</a></p>

Much of the previous work on the link between cancer and nightshifts has focused on breast cancer . . . The latest report, focusing on ovarian cancer,  was published  in the April issue of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.


This increase in the risk for ovarian cancer with nightshift work is consistent with, and of similar magnitude to, the risk for breast cancer, say lead author Parveen Bhatti, PhD, and colleagues from the epidemiology program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.


The researchers examined data from a local population-based cancer registry that is part of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. They identified 1101 women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, 389 with borderline disease, and 1832 without ovarian cancer (control group).


The women, who were 35 to 74 years of age, were asked about the hours they worked, and specifically whether they had ever worked the nig</p><p>6 0.80441213 <a title="129-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-29-I%E2%80%99m_looking_for_a_quadrille_notebook_with_faint_lines.html">1235 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-29-I’m looking for a quadrille notebook with faint lines</a></p>

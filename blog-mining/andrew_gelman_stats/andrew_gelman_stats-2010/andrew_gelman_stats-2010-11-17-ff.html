<p>Introduction: I had the following email exchange with a reader of Bayesian Data Analysis.
  

 
 My correspondent wrote:   Exercise 1(b) involves evaluating the normal pdf at a single point. But p(Y=y|mu,sigma) = 0 (and is not simply N(y|mu,sigma)), since the normal distribution is continuous. So it seems that part (b) of the exercise is inappropriate.
 
The solution does actually evaluate the probability as the value of the pdf at the single point, which is wrong. The probabilities should all be 0, so the answer to (b) is undefined.
 
 I replied:   The pdf is the probability density function, which for a continuous distribution is defined as the derivative of the cumulative density function.  The notation in BDA is rigorous but we do not spell out all the details, so I can see how confusion is possible. 
 
 My correspondent:   I agree that the pdf is the derivative of the cdf. But to compute P(a .lt. Y .lt. b) for a continuous distribution (with support in the real line) requires integrating over t</p><p>3 0.10429926 <a title="418-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-29-Stupid_R_Tricks%3A__Random_Scope.html">2190 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-29-Stupid R Tricks:  Random Scope</a></p>

 About Scope 
 
I mentioned to Andrew I would prefer pure lexical, static scoping, as found in languages like C++ and Java.  If you’re not familiar with the alternatives, there’s a nice overview in the  Wikipedia article on scope .  Let me call out a few passages that will help set the context.
  

A fundamental distinction in scoping is what “context” means – whether name resolution depends on the location in the source code (lexical scope, static scope, which depends on the lexical context) or depends on the program state when the name is encountered (dynamic scope, which depends on the execution context or calling context). Lexical resolution can be determined at compile time, and is also known as early binding, while dynamic resolution can in general only be determined at run time, and thus</p><p>4 0.080426417 <a title="418-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-28-Agreement_Groups_in_US_Senate_and_Dynamic_Clustering.html">1286 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-28-Agreement Groups in US Senate and Dynamic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrien Friggeri has a lovely  visualization  of US Senators movement between clusters:
 
   
 
You have to click the image and play with it to appreciate it. The methodology isn’t yet published – but I can see how this could be very illuminating. The dynamic clustering aspect hasn’t been researched much – one of the notable pieces is the Blei and Lafferty  dynamic topic model of Science .
 
I did a static  analysis of the US Senate  back in 2005 with Wray Buntine and coauthors. Some additional visualizations and the source code are  here . We did a dynamic analysis of US Supreme Court on  this blog  but there’s also a  paper . 
 
My knowledge on this topic is out of date, however. Who has been doing good work in this area? I’ll organize the links.

 Here’s  my candidate for bad graphic of the year:


   


I [Seth] studied it and learned nothing. I have no idea how they assigned colors to locations. I already knew that there were more within-city calls than calls to individual distant locations — for example that there are more SF-SF calls than SF-LA calls. The researchers took a huge rich database and boiled it down to nothing (in terms of information value) — and I have a funny feeling they don’t realize how awful this is and what a waste.


I send it to you because it isn’t obvious how to do better — at least not obvious to them.
  
My reply:
 
My first reaction is to agree–I don’t get anything out of this graph either! But let me step back.
 
I think it’s best to understand this using the framework of  my paper with Antony Unwin , by thinking of the goals that are satisfied by different sorts of graphs.

<p>Introduction: Some thoughts from Christian , including this bit:
  
We need to consider separately


1. R’s brilliant library


2. R’s not-so-brilliant language and/or interpreter.
  
I don’t know that R’s library is so brilliant as all that–if necessary, I don’t think it would be hard to reprogram the important packages in a new language.
 
I would say, though, that the problems with R are not just in the technical details of the language.  I think the culture of R has some problems too.  As I’ve written before, R functions used to be lean and mean, and now they’re full of exception-handling and calls to other packages.  R functions are spaghetti-like messes of connections in which I keep expecting to run into syntax like “GOTO 120.”
 
I learned about these problems a couple years ago when writing bayesglm(), which is a simple adaptation of glm().  But glm(), and its workhorse, glm.fit(), are a mess:  They’re about 10 lines of functioning code, plus about 20 lines of necessary front-end, plus a cou</p><p>4 0.62840897 <a title="418-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-23-Thinking_of_doing_a_list_experiment%3F__Here%E2%80%99s_a_list_of_reasons_why_you_should_think_again.html">2303 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-23-Thinking of doing a list experiment?

<p>Introduction: Someone wrote in:
  
We are about to conduct a voting list experiment. We came across your  comment  recommending that each item be removed from the list.  Would greatly appreciate it if you take a few minutes to spell out your recommendation in a little more detail. In particular: (a) Why are you “uneasy” about list experiments? What would strengthen your confidence in list experiments? (b) What do you mean by “each item be removed”? As you know, there are several non-sensitive items and one sensitive item in a list experiment. Do you mean that the non-sensitive items should be removed one-by-one for the control group or are you suggesting a multiple arm design in which each arm of the experiment has one non-sensitive item removed. What would be achieved by this design?
  
I replied:  I’ve always been a bit skeptical about list experiments, partly because I worry that the absolute number of items on the list could itself affect the response.

I [Folta] was looking for R packages to address a project I’m working on and stumbled onto a package called ‘plspm’. It seems to be a nice package, but the thing I wanted to pass on is  the PDF  that Gaston Sanchez, its author, wrote that describes PLS Path Analysis in general and shows how to use plspm in particular. It’s like a 200-page R vignette that’s really informative and fun to read. I’d recommend it to you and your readers: even if you don’t want to delve into PLS and plspm deeply, the first seven pages and the Appendix A provide a great read about a grad student, PLS Path Analysis, and the history of the field.

<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>2 0.802719 <a title="418-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-23-MLB_Hall_of_Fame_Voting_Trajectories.html">1689 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-23-MLB Hall of Fame Voting Trajectories</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces. The result is a series of elegant graph problems where the viable paths change with each move of your opponent. To draw an analogy with chess, imagine if moving your knight could allow your opponent’s bishop to move like a rook. Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?


Part of the problem is that we learn the game as children so we tend to think of it as a children’s game. We focus on how simple the rules are and miss how much complexity and subtlety you can get out of those ru</p><p>5 0.66892362 <a title="418-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-13-A_personal_bit_of_spam%2C_just_for_me%21.html">1211 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-13-A personal bit of spam, just for me!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Andrew,


I came across your site while searching for blogs and posts around American obesity and wanted to reach out to get your readership’s feedback on an infographic my team built which focuses on the obesity of America and where we could end up at the going rate.


If you’re interested, let’s connect. Have a great weekend!


Thanks.

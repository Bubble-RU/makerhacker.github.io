It started when Jeff Lax made  this comment  on his recent blog entry:
  
 Nebraska Is All That Counts for a Party-Bucking Nelson 


Dem Senator On Blowback From His Opposition To Kagan: ‘Are They From Nebraska? Then I Don’t Care’


Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…
  
I conferred with Jeff and then wrote the following entry for fivethirtyeight.com.  There was a backlog of posts at 538 at the time, so I set it on delay to appear the following morning.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>4 0.19811262 <a title="162-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-14-More_on_Mister_P_and_how_it_does_what_it_does.html">2061 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-14-More on Mister P and how it does what it does</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on  our discussion  the other day, Matt Buttice and Ben Highton write:
  
It was nice to see our article mentioned and discussed by Andrew, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza on Andrew’s blog in this post on Wednesday.  As noted in the post, we recently published an  article  in Political Analysis on how well multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) performs at producing estimates of state opinion with conventional national surveys where N≈1,500.  Our central claims are that (i) the performance of MRP is highly variable, (ii) in the absence of knowing the true values, it is difficult to determine the quality of the MRP estimates produced on the basis of a single national sample, and, (iii) therefore, our views about the usefulness of MRP in instances where a researcher has a single sample of N≈1,500 are less optimistic than the ones expressed in previous research on the topic.  


Obviously we were interested in the blog posts.  We found them stimulating</p><p>5 0.18667211 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-09-Mister_P%3A__What%E2%80%99s_its_secret_sauce%3F.html">2056 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-09-Mister P:  What’s its secret sauce?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science—and soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It’s taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power—as well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.
 
As a method becomes used more and more widely, there will be natural concerns about its domains of applicability.

<p>Introduction: The above graph shows the estimated support, by state, for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a gay rights bill that the Senate will be voting on this Monday.  The estimates were constructed by Kate Krimmel, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips using multilevel regression and poststratification.
 
Check out that graph again.  The scale goes from 20% to 80%, but  every state  is in the yellow-to-red range.  Support for a law making it illegal to discriminate against gays has majority support in every state. And in most states the support is very strong.
 
And  here’s the research paper  by Krimmel, Lax, and Phillips, which begins:
  
Public majorities have supported several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress has responded slowly if at all. We address this puzzle through dyadic analysis of the opinion- vote relationship on 23 roll-call votes between 1993 and 2010, matching members of Congress to policy-specific opinion in their state or district.

Dem Senator On Blowback From His Opposition To Kagan: ‘Are They From Nebraska? Then I Don’t Care’


Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…

By nearly all accounts, the Republicans looks set to take over the US House of Representatives in next week’s November 2010 general election. . . . Republicans, in this wave election that recalls 1994, look set to win not just swing districts, but also those districts that have been traditionally Democratic, or those with strong or longtime Democratic incumbents. Naturally, just as in 2008, this has led to overclaiming by jubilant conservatives and distraught liberals-though the adjectives were then reversed-that this portends a realignment in American politics. . . .


Republican moderates in Congress are often associated with two factors: 1) a liberal voting record earlier in their career, and 2) a liberal district. Of course, both are related, in the sense that ambitious moderates choose liberal districts to run in, and liberal districts weed out conservative candidates. . . .

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>6 0.69496131 <a title="162-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Doug_Hibbs_on_the_fundamentals_in_2010.html">292 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Doug Hibbs on the fundamentals in 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On the basis of two papers and because it is completely obvious, we (meaning  me , Justin, and  John ) predict that Elena Kagan will get confirmed to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  But we also want to see how close we can come to predicting the votes for and against.
 
We actually have two sets of predictions, both using the MRP technique discussed previously on this blog.  The first is based on our  recent paper  in the  Journal of Politics  showing that support for the nominee in a senator’s home state plays a striking role in whether she or he votes to confirm the nominee.  The second is based on a  new working paper  extending “basic” MRP to show that senators respond far more to their co-partisans than the median voter in their home states.  Usually, our vote “predictions” do not differ much, but there is a group of senators who are predicted to vote yes for Kagan with a probability around 50% and the two sets of predictions thus differ for Kagan more than usual.</p><p>2 0.88939321 <a title="162-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-01-References_on_predicting_elections.html">249 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-01-References on predicting elections</a></p>

I would be grateful for any reference you could provide in the way of articles and books.
  
My reply:  Political scientists have worked on this problem, and it’s easy enough to imagine hierarchical models of the sort discussed in my book with Jennifer. I can picture what I would do if asked to forecast at the precinct level, for example to model exit polls.  (In fact, I was briefly hired by the exit poll consortium in 2000 to do this, but then after I told them about hierarchical Bayes, they un-hired me!)  But I don’t actually know of any literature on precinct-level forecasting.

Fast learning algorithms for discovering the hidden structure in data


Daniel Hsu, Microsoft Research


11am, Wednesday April 10th, Interschool lab, 7th floor CEPSR, Columbia University


A major challenge in machine learning is to reliably and automatically discover hidden structure in data with minimal human intervention.  For instance, one may be interested in understanding the stratification of a population into subgroups, the thematic make-up of a collection of documents, or the dynamical process governing a complex time series.  Many of the core statistical estimation problems for these applications are, in general, provably intractable for both computational and statistical reasons; and therefore progress is made by shifting the focus to realistic instances that rule out the intractable cases.  In this talk, I’ll describe a general computational approach for correctly estimating a wide class of statistical mod</p><p>4 0.88349581 <a title="162-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-30-Why_is_George_Apley_overrated%3F.html">119 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-30-Why is George Apley overrated?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  comment  by Mark Palko reminded me that, while I’m a huge  Marquand  fan, I think The Late George Apley is way overrated.  My theory is that Marquand’s best books don’t fit into the modernist way of looking about literature, and that the gatekeepers of the 1930s and 1940s, when judging Marquand by these standards, conveniently labeled Apley has his best book because it had a form–Edith-Wharton-style satire–that they could handle.  In contrast, Point of No Return and all the other classics are a mixture of seriousness and satire that left critics uneasy.
 
Perhaps there’s a way to study this sort of thing more systematically?</p><p>5 0.88166666 <a title="162-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-22-Beach_reads%2C_Proust%2C_and_income_tax.html">103 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-22-Beach reads, Proust, and income tax</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The commenting feature doesn’t work for me on Helen DeWitt’s blog so I’m forced to comment on her entries here.
 
1.  She  discusses  whether it’s fair to characterize  The Last Samurai .  I have a slightly different perspective on this:  I’ve never really understood the idea that a “beach read” should be something light and fluffy.  On the beach, you can relax, you have the time to get into anything.  I could see wanting something light on the subway–you have to be able to get into it right away and follow it amid all the jostles.  I guess the point is that when you’re at the beach, you’re far from the library.  So what you really want for the beach is not necessarily something relaxing or easy to read, but rather a  sure thing , a known quantity that you’ll definitely enjoy.  No point sitting on the beach reading a book that you hate.
 
2.  In an interesting  discussion  of translation, DeWitt recommends learning a language by reading great literature in the original tongue.

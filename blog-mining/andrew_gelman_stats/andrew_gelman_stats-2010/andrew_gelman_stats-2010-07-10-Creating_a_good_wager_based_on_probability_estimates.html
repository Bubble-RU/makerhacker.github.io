</p><p>5 If we disagree on the probability, then there should be a bet that we are both happy to make — happy, because each of us thinks we are coming out ahead (in expectation). [sent-9, score-0.77]
</p><p>6 Consider an event that I think has a 1/3 chance of occurring, but you put the probability at only 1/10. [sent-10, score-0.573]
</p><p>7 If you offer, say, 5:1 odds — I pay you $1 if the event doesn’t occur, but you pay me $5 if it does — each of us will think this is a good deal. [sent-11, score-1.158]
</p><p>8 I should be willing to accept any odds higher than 2:1, and you should be willing to offer any odds up to 9:1. [sent-13, score-1.003]
</p><p>9 I started pondering this question when I read  the details of a wager , or rather a non-wager, that I had previously only heard about in outline: scientists James Annan and Richard Lindzen were unable to agree to terms for a bet about climate change. [sent-15, score-1.038]
</p><p>10 You can imagine a disagreement over the details — since the global temperature anomaly can’t be measured exactly, perhaps you’d want to call off the bet (doing so is called a “push” in betting parlance) if the anomaly is estimated to be, say, between 0. [sent-18, score-1.003]
</p><p>11 22 C — but surely, given that the probability assessments are so different, there should still be a wager that both sides are eager to make! [sent-20, score-0.515]
</p><p>12 Chris Hibbert has discussed the issue of agreeing on a bet   on his blog , where he mentions that Dan Reeves “argues, convincingly, that the arithmetic mean gives each party the same expectation of gain, and that is what fairness requires. [sent-22, score-0.746]
</p><p>13 Suppose I think the probability of a given event is a, and you think the probability is b. [sent-25, score-0.806]
</p><p>14 If the event occurs, you will pay me $x, and if it doesn’t occur, I will pay you $y. [sent-26, score-0.694]
</p><p>15 We don’t need to know the actual probability in order to figure out how much each of us  thinks  the bet is worth: I think I will gain ax – (1-a)y, and you think you will gain -bx + (1-b)y. [sent-27, score-1.368]
</p><p>16 We might say a wager is “reasonable”  — the word “fair” is already taken — if I think it’s worth as much to me as you think it is worth to you. [sent-28, score-0.597]
</p><p>17 Look at it this way: I should be willing to pay up to ax – (1-a)y to participate in this wager, and you should be willing to pay up to -bx + (1-b)y. [sent-29, score-1.001]
</p><p>18 If those amounts are equal, then we’d each be willing to pay the same amount to participate in this game. [sent-30, score-0.477]
</p><p>19 Setting the two terms equal and doing the math, we end up with a reasonable bet if x= y(2-(a+b))/(a+b) or, equivalently, x = y(2/(a+b) – 1). [sent-31, score-0.63]
</p><p>20 So, I agree with Dan Reeves and his co-authors: the way to make a reasonable bet is to take the arithmetic mean of the probability estimates. [sent-33, score-1.023]

<p>Introduction: Gregg Easterbrook :
  
Gingrich is a wild card. He probably would end up a flaming wreckage in electoral terms, but there’s a chance he could become seen as the man unafraid to bring sweeping change to an ossified Washington, D.C. There’s perhaps a 90 percent likelihood Obama would wipe the floor with Gingrich, versus a 10 percent likelihood Gingrich would stage an historic upset.
  
This is the dumbest thing I’ve seen since . . . ummm, I dunno, how bout  this ?  It actually gets worse because Easterbrook then invokes game theory.  What next?  Catastrophe theory?  Intelligent design?
 
P.S.  Maybe I should explain for readers without an education in probability theory.  Let’s suppose “wipe the floor” means that Obama gets 55%+ of the two-party vote, and let’s suppose that “an historic upset” means that Obama gets less than 50% of the vote.  Now try to draw a forecast distribution that has 90% of its probability above 0.55 and 10% of it’s probability below 0.50.  It’s a pretty weird-loo</p><p>3 0.13789463 <a title="138-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-20-Problemen_met_het_boek.html">1332 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-20-Problemen met het boek</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regarding the so-called Dutch Book argument for Bayesian inference (the idea that, if your inferences do not correspond to a Bayesian posterior distribution, you can be forced to make incoherent bets and ultimately become a money pump), I wrote:
 
I have never found this argument appealing, because a bet is a game not a decision.  A bet requires 2 players, and one player has to offer the bets.  I do agree that in some bounded settings (for example, betting on win place show in a horse race), I’d want my bets to be coherent; if they are incoherent (e.g., if my bets correspond to P(A|B)*P(B) not being equal to P(A,B)), then I should be able to do better by examining the incoherence.  But in an “open system” (to borrow some physics jargon), I don’t think coherence is possible.  There is always new information coming in, and there is always additional prior information in reserve that hasn’t entered the model.</p><p>4 0.11411659 <a title="138-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-05-Prior_distribution_for_a_predicted_probability.html">2200 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-05-Prior distribution for a predicted probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
I have an interesting thought on a prior for a logistic regression, and would love your input on how to make it “work.”


Some of my research, two published papers, are on mathematical models of **.  Along those lines, I’m interested in developing more models for **. . . .  Empirical studies show that the public is rather smart and that the wisdom-of-the-crowd is fairly accurate.


So, my thought would be to tread the public’s probability of the event as a prior, and then see how adding data, through a model, would change or perturb our inferred probability of **.  (Similarly, I could envision using previously published epidemiological research as a prior probability of a disease, and then seeing how the addition of new testing protocols would update that belief.)


However, everything I learned about hierarchical Bayesian models has a prior as a distribution on the coefficients.  I don’t know how to start with a prior point estimate for the probabili</p><p>5 0.11122297 <a title="138-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_like_this_cartoon.html">1572 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-10-I don’t like this cartoon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>6 0.104306 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-06-Priors_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">2322 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-06-Priors I don’t believe</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I recently  wrote  about the difficulty people have with probabilities, in this case the probability that Obama wins the election. If the probability is reported as 70%, people think Obama is going to win.  Actually, though, it just means that Obama is predicted to get about 50.8% of the two-party vote, with an uncertainty of something like 2 percentage points.  So, as I wrote, the election really is too close to call in the sense that the predicted vote margin is less than its uncertainty.
 
But . . . when people see a number such as 70%, they tend to attribute too much certainty to it.  Especially when the estimated probability has increased from, say 60%.  How to get the point across?  Commenter HS  had  what seems like a good suggestion:
  
Say that Obama will win, but there is 25% chance (or whatever) that this prediction is wrong? Same point, just slightly different framing, but somehow, this seems far less incendiary.
  
I like that.  Somehow a stated probability of 75% sounds a</p><p>3 0.7865507 <a title="138-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-06-Priors_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">2322 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-06-Priors I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Biostatistician Jeff Leek  writes :
  
Think about this headline: “Hospital checklist cut infections, saved lives.” I [Leek] am a pretty skeptical person, so I’m a little surprised that a checklist could really save lives. I say the odds of this being true are 1 in 4.
  
I’m actually surprised that he’s surprised, since over the years I’ve heard about the benefits of checklists in various arenas, including hospital care.  In particular, there was  this article  by Atul Gawande from a few years back.  I mean, sure, I could imagine that checklists might hurt:  after all, it takes some time and effort to put together the checklist and to use it, and perhaps the very existence of the checklist could give hospital staff a false feeling of security, which would ultimately cost lives.  But my first guess would be that people still don’t do enough checklisting, and that the probability is greater than 1/4 that a checklist in a hospital will save lives.

<p>Introduction: Jason Kottke  posts  this puzzle from Gary Foshee that reportedly impressed people at a puzzle-designers’ convention:
  
I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?


The first thing you think is “What has Tuesday got to do with it?” Well, it has everything to do with it.
  
I thought I should really figure this one out myself before reading any further, and I decided this was a good time to apply my general principle that it’s always best to solve such problems from scratch rather than trying to guess at the answer.
  

 
So I laid out all the 4 x 49 possibilities.  The 4 is bb, bg, gb, gg, and the 49 are all possible pairs of days of the week.  Then I ruled out all the possibilities that were inconsistent with the data:  this leaves the following:
 
bb with all pairs of days that include a Tuesday.  That’s 13 possibilities (Mon/Tues, Tues/Tues, Wed/Tues, …, Tues/Mon, …, Sun/Tues, remembering not to count Tues/Tues twice).

<p>Introduction: I had the following email exchange with a reader of Bayesian Data Analysis.
  

 
 My correspondent wrote:   Exercise 1(b) involves evaluating the normal pdf at a single point. But p(Y=y|mu,sigma) = 0 (and is not simply N(y|mu,sigma)), since the normal distribution is continuous. So it seems that part (b) of the exercise is inappropriate.
 
The solution does actually evaluate the probability as the value of the pdf at the single point, which is wrong. The probabilities should all be 0, so the answer to (b) is undefined.
 
 I replied:   The pdf is the probability density function, which for a continuous distribution is defined as the derivative of the cumulative density function.  The notation in BDA is rigorous but we do not spell out all the details, so I can see how confusion is possible. 
 
 My correspondent:   I agree that the pdf is the derivative of the cdf. But to compute P(a .lt. Y .lt. b) for a continuous distribution (with support in the real line) requires integrating over t</p><p>6 0.74529082 <a title="138-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-22-Is_it_meaningful_to_talk_about_a_probability_of_%E2%80%9C65.7%25%E2%80%9D_that_Obama_will_win_the_election%3F.html">1544 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-22-Is it meaningful to talk about a probability of “65.7%” that Obama will win the election?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yaming Yu and Xiao-Li Meng  write in  with a cool new idea for improving the efficiency of Gibbs and Metropolis in multilevel models:
  
For a broad class of multilevel models, there exist two well-known competing parameterizations, the centered parameterization (CP) and the non-centered parameterization (NCP), for effective MCMC implementation. Much literature has been devoted to the questions of when to use which and how to compromise between them via partial CP/NCP. This article introduces an alternative strategy for boosting MCMC efficiency via simply interweaving—but not alternating—the two parameterizations. This strategy has the surprising property that failure of both the CP and NCP chains to converge geometrically does not prevent the interweaving algorithm from doing so. It achieves this seemingly magical property by taking advantage of the discordance of the two parameterizations, namely, the sufficiency of CP and the ancillarity of NCP, to substantially reduce the Markovian</p><p>2 0.93875021 <a title="138-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-%E2%80%9CTo_Rethink_Sprawl%2C_Start_With_Offices%E2%80%9D.html">1029 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-“To Rethink Sprawl, Start With Offices”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
  
Just to throw some Richard Florida in the mix:  Back in 1990, I  turned down  a job offer from Bell Labs, larg</p><p>3 0.93687809 <a title="138-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-25-Rechecking_the_census.html">730 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-25-Rechecking the census</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sam Roberts  writes :
  
The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>same-blog 4 0.93592042 <a title="138-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Creating_a_good_wager_based_on_probability_estimates.html">138 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Creating a good wager based on probability estimates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose you and I agree on a probability estimate…perhaps we both agree there is a 2/3 chance Spain will beat Netherlands in tomorrow’s World Cup.  In this case, we could agree on a wager: if Spain beats Netherlands, I pay you $x.  If Netherlands beats Spain, you pay me $2x.  It is easy to see that my expected loss (or win) is $0, and that the same is true for you. Either of us should be indifferent to taking this bet, and to which side of the bet we are on.  We might make this bet just to increase our interest in watching the game, but neither of us would see a money-making opportunity here. 
 
By the way, the relationship between “odds” and the event probability — a 1/3 chance of winning turning into a bet at 2:1 odds — is that if the event probability is p, then a fair bet has odds of (1/p – 1):1.  
 
More interesting, and more relevant to many real-world situations, is the case that we disagree on the probability of an event.  If we disagree on the probability, then there should be</p><p>5 0.93061668 <a title="138-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-16-%E2%80%9CFor_individuals_with_wine_training%2C_however%2C_we_find__indications_of_a_positive_relationship_between_price_and_enjoyment%E2%80%9D.html">470 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-16-“For individuals with wine training, however, we find  indications of a positive relationship between price and enjoyment”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this blog post quotes the second line of the abstract of Goldstein et al.’s much ballyhooed 2008 tech report,  Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?  Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings .  
 
The first sentence of the abstract is
  

Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.

  
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the easy target wine snobs make, the popular press has picked up on the first sentence of the tech report.  For example, the  Freakonomics blog/radio entry  of the same name quotes the first line, ignores the qualification, then concludes

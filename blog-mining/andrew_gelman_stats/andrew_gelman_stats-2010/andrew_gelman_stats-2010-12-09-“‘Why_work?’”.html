<p>Introduction: Bruce McCullough writes:
  
The Sept 2009 issue of Wired had a  big article  on the increase in the placebo effect, and why it’s been getting bigger.


Kaiser Fung has a  synopsis .


As if you don’t have enough to do, I thought you might be interested in blogging on this.
  
My reply:
 
I thought Kaiser’s discussion was good, especially this point:
  
Effect on treatment group = Effect of the drug + effect of belief in being treated


Effect on placebo group = Effect of belief in being treated


Thus, the difference between the two groups = effect of the drug, since the effect of belief in being treated affects both groups of patients.
  
Thus, as Kaiser puts it, if the treatment isn’t doing better than placebo, it doesn’t say that the placebo effect is big (let alone “too big”) but that the treatment isn’t showing any additional effect.  It’s “treatment + placebo” vs. placebo, not treatment vs. placebo.
 
That said, I’d prefer for Kaiser to make it clear that the additivity he’s assu</p><p>5 0.16209275 <a title="461-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-26-Infoviz_on_top_of_stat_graphic_on_top_of_spreadsheet.html">2186 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-26-Infoviz on top of stat graphic on top of spreadsheet</a></p>

What makes the designer want to tilt the reader’s head?


This chart is unreadable. It also fails the self-sufficiency test. All 13 data points are printed onto the chart. You really don’t need the axis, and the gridlines.


A further design flaw is the use of signposts. Our eyes are drawn to the hexagons containing the brand icons but the data is at the other end of the signpost, where it is planted on the surface!


Here is a sketch of something not as cute:


 


I [Kaiser] expressed time as years . . . The mobile-related entities are labelled red. The dots could be replaced by the hexagonal brand icons.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s criticisms, and I agree that his graph is, from the statistical perspective, a zillion times better than what was published. On the other hand, unusual images can get attention. Recall the famous/notorious clock plot from  Florence Nightingale .

This argument sounds convincing at first, but I’m not completely sure it’s right.  I’d just like to expand on one of Kaiser’s other points, which is that people don’t usually have a choice between a minimum-wage job and a $60,000 job.

<p>Introduction: I keep encountering the word “Groupon”–I think it’s some sort of pets.com-style commercial endeavor where people can buy coupons?  I don’t really care, and I’ve avoided googling the word out of a general animosity toward our society’s current glorification of get-rich-quick schemes.  (As you can tell, I’m still bitter about that whole  stock market  thing.)
 
Anyway, even without knowing what Groupon actually is, I enjoyed  this blog  by Kaiser Fung in which he tries to work out some of its economic consequences.  He connects the statistical notion of counterfactuals to the concept of opportunity cost from economics.  The comments are interesting too.</p><p>3 0.78715146 <a title="461-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-Three_hours_in_the_life_of_a_statistician.html">1001 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-Three hours in the life of a statistician</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung tells  what it’s really like .
 
Here’s a sample:
  
As soon as I [Kaiser] put the substring-concatenate expression together with two lines of code that generate data tables, it choked.
  
Sorta like Dashiell Hammett without the broads and the heaters.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  asks  the interesting question:  How do you measure what restaurants are “overrated”?  You can’t just ask people, right?  There’s some sort of social element here, that “overrated” implies that someone’s out there doing the rating.</p><p>5 0.76820344 <a title="461-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-NYT_shills_for_personal_DNA_tests.html">543 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-NYT shills for personal DNA tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>6 0.76042849 <a title="461-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-19-What_makes_a_statistician_look_like_a_hero%3F.html">2031 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-19-What makes a statistician look like a hero?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links to  a “scary comparison” that claims that “a one-parent family of three making $14,500 a year (minimum wage) has more disposable income than a family making $60,000 a year.”
 
Kaiser Fung  looks into this comparison  in more detail.  As Kaiser puts it:
  
 
If we concede that the middle-income person would end up with less disposable income than the lower-income person, then we’d expect that the middle-income people will take lower-paying jobs so as to increase their disposable income. But I have not seen reports of such reverse social mobility. Theory needs to fit reality. This hole in the theory needs to be covered.
 

 
This argument sounds convincing at first, but I’m not completely sure it’s right.  I’d just like to expand on one of Kaiser’s other points, which is that people don’t usually have a choice between a minimum-wage job and a $60,000 job.  Also, my impression is that higher-paying jobs are more pleasant than lower-paying jobs.

The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>3 0.95392263 <a title="461-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-03-More_research_on_the_role_of_puzzles_in_processing_data_graphics.html">1747 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-03-More research on the role of puzzles in processing data graphics</a></p>

 We mostly do  computational modeling of human vision.  We try to do on the one hand the sort of basic science that fits in the human vision community, while on the other hand developing predictive models which might actually lend insight into design.  


 Your talk  resonated with me in part because of  this paper  [Do Predictions of Visual Perception Aid Design?, by Ruth Rosenholtz, Amal Dorai, and Rosalind Freeman].  We went into our study thinking that people would like to have a quantitative tool to help analyze designs.  But what we concluded, somewhat anecdotally, was that its main use seemed to be as a conversation-starter, and a means of communicating ideas about the design.  And  the reason it seemed to work is that our visualizations were the right level of a “puzzle” — challenging enough to be a bit fun to work out.

Here in Italy an “hype” topic is the “staffetta tra generazioni”, handover between generations: since unemployment rate in young people is very high, someone in the government is thinking to encourage older people to anticipate their retirement to make more jobs available for youngs. 
I am not an economist and I don’t want to discuss the economic plausibility of such a possible measure. 
However, some economists deny its success simply on the basis of a correlation and regression analysis. You can see the charts used as “evidence” here: http://www.lavoce.info/per-una-vera-staffetta-generazionale/ and here: http://noisefromamerika.org/articolo/occupazione-ricambio-intergenerazionale. 
The first chart shows that there is no correlation between activity rate in older people and unemployment rate in younger people.

<p>Introduction: Freakonomics  reports :
  

A reader in Norway named Christian Sørensen examined the height statistics for all players in the 2010 World Cup and found an interesting anomaly: there seemed to be unnaturally few players listed at 169, 179, and 189 centimeters and an apparent surplus of players who were 170, 180, and 190 centimeters tall (roughly 5-foot-7 inches, 5-foot-11 inches, and 6-foot-3 inches, respectively). Here’s the data:

  
 
 
It’s not costless to communicate numbers. When we compare “eighty” (6 characters) vs “seventy-nine” (12 characters) – how much information are we gaining by twice the number of characters? Do people really care about height at +-0.5 cm or is +-1 cm enough?
 
It’s harder to communicate odd numbers (“three” vs four or two, “seven” vs “six” or “eight”, “nine” vs “ten”) than even ones. As language tends to follow our behaviors, people have been doing it for a long time. We remember the shorter description of a quantity.

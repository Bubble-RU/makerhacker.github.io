<p>Introduction: I’ve earlier written that  science is science communication —that is, the act of communicating scientific ideas and findings to ourselves and others is itself a central part of science.  My point was to push against a conventional separation between the act of science and the act of communication, the idea that science is done by scientists and communication is done by communicators.  It’s a rare bit of science that does not include communication as part of it.  As a scientist and science communicator myself, I’m particularly sensitive to devaluing of communication.  (For example, Bayesian Data Analysis is full of original research that was done in order to communicate; or, to put it another way, we often think we understand a scientific idea, but once we try to communicate it, we recognize gaps in our understanding that motivate further research.)
 
I once saw the following on one of those inspirational-sayings-for-every-day desk calendars: “To have ideas is to gather flowers.

<p>Introduction: When linking to my  review  of Duncan Watts’s book in a recent post, I came across some fun bits that I’d like to share (for those of you who didn’t just click through and read the whole thing):
 
On business books:
  
I’m not so interested in the business angle but I suppose that’s how you sell books these days. The business part of the book was ok—I’m not saying it was filler—it’s just that I’m not particularly interested in which format of videocassette wins, or whether Cisco Systems is a well-run company. I realize that a lot of people care about this sort of things nowadays, but I’d rather talk about sports or politics.
  
On dodgy science writer John Gribbin:
  
Sure, people write all sorts of silly things but usually they have some sort of political or religious excuse for why it’s ok to believe them. Truth is not the only important value in life, there are also other concerns such as political convictions, religious beliefs, and the simple desire to avoid offending people.

<p>Introduction: Postdoctoral position in statistical modeling of social networks 
 
A full-time postdoctoral position is available beginning Fall 2014 in the research group of Tian Zheng and Andrew Gelman working on statistical analysis and modeling of social network data, in close cooperation with our experimental collaborators. Four key papers of this project so far are:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/overdisp_final.pdf
 
http://nersp.osg.ufl.edu/~ufruss/documents/mccormick_salganik_zheng10.pdf
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/DiPreteetal.pdf
 
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2473.pdf
 
Requirements: The work is highly interdisciplinary, and applicants must have strong statistical and computational skills.  Social science research skills are preferred but not necessary. Preferred educational background is a PhD in statistics, computer science, political science, sociology, or a related field. Expertise in Bayesian modeling and computing is required.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: We’re doing a new thing here at the Applied Statistics Center, throwing monthly Friday afternoon mini-conferences in the Playroom (inspired by our successful miniconference on statistical consulting a couple years ago).
 
 This Friday (10 Sept), 1-5pm :
 
Come join us this Friday, September 10th for an engaging interdisciplinary discussion of risk perception at the individual and societal level, and the role it plays in current environmental, social, and health policy debates. All are welcome!
 
“Risk Perception in Environmental Decision-Making”
 
Elke Weber, Columbia Business School
 
“Cultural Cognition and the Problem of Science Communication”
 
Dan Kahan, Yale Law School
 
Discussants include:
 
Michael Gerrard, Columbia Law School
 
David Epstein, Department of Political Science, Columbia University

<p>Introduction: Martyn Plummer , the creator of the open-source, C++, graphical-model compiler  JAGS  (aka “Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), runs a forum on the JAGS site that has a very similar feel to the mail-bag posts on this blog.  Martyn answers general statistical computing questions (e.g., why slice sampling rather than Metropolis-Hastings?) and general modeling (e.g., why won’t my model converge with this prior?).
 
Here’s the link to the top-level JAGS site, and to the forum:
  
   JAGS Forum 
    JAGS Home Page 
   
The forum’s pretty active, with the stats page showing hundreds of views per day and very regular posts and answers.  Martyn’s last post was today.
 
Martyn also has a blog devoted to JAGS and other stats news:

<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>4 0.91063344 <a title="267-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-More_bad_news%3A__The_%28mis%29reporting_of_statistical_results_in_psychology_journals.html">933 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-More bad news:  The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another entry in the growing literature on systematic flaws in the scientific research literature.
 
This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data. Regrettably, only 24% of the authors shared their data, despite our request</p><p>5 0.89581704 <a title="267-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-07-The_more_likely_it_is_to_be_X%2C_the_more_likely_it_is_to_be_Not_X%3F.html">1158 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-07-The more likely it is to be X, the more likely it is to be Not X?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>6 0.88490117 <a title="267-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-12-More_frustrations_trying_to_replicate_an_analysis_published_in_a_reputable_journal.html">1054 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-12-More frustrations trying to replicate an analysis published in a reputable journal</a></p>

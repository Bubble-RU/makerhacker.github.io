<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>3 0.10721293 <a title="60-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-19-%E2%80%9COne_of_the_easiest_ways_to_differentiate_an_economist_from_almost_anyone_else_in_society%E2%80%9D.html">809 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-19-“One of the easiest ways to differentiate an economist from almost anyone else in society”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>4 0.10544761 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Economics_now_%3D_Freudian_psychology_in_the_1950s%3A__More_on_the_incoherence_of_%E2%80%9Ceconomics_exceptionalism%E2%80%9D.html">1213 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Economics now = Freudian psychology in the 1950s:  More on the incoherence of “economics exceptionalism”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What follows is a long response to a comment on  someone else’s blog .  The quote is, “Thinking like an economist simply means that you scientifically approach human social behavior. . . .”
 
I’ll give the context in a bit, but first let me say that I thought this topic might be worth one more discussion because I suspect that the sort of economics exceptionalism that I will discuss is widely disseminated in college econ courses as well as in books such as the Freakonomics series.
 
It’s great to have pride in human achievements but at some point too much group self-regard can be distorting.
 
My best analogy to economics exceptionalism is Freudianism in the 1950s:  Back then, Freudian psychiatrists were on the top of the world.  Not only were they well paid, well respected, and secure in their theoretical foundations, they were also at the center of many important conversations.  Even those people who disagreed with them felt the need to explain why the Freudians were wrong.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  and  this .  There seems to be a perception that “economists, the people who will cooly explain why people will be completely corrupt if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, see themselves as being completely not corrupt” (according to Atrios) and that “the economists who have decided to lend their names to the [Romney] campaign have been caught up in this culture of fraud” (according to Krugman).
 
The bloggers above are talking about macro, and perhaps they’re right that macroeconomists see themselves as uncorruptible and above it all.  As with political science, the key parts of macroeconomics are about what is good for the world (or, at least, what is good for the country), and it’s hard to do this well from a level of complete cynicism.  I’m no expert on macroeconomics, but my general impression is that, Marxists aside, macroeconomists tend to assume shared goals.

<p>Introduction: Joseph Delaney  writes :
  
Is it fair to quote the definition of economics from the blurb for a book?  If so, consider this definition in the blurb for Emily Oster’s new book:

 
When Oster was expecting her first child, she felt powerless to make the right decisions for her pregnancy. How doctors think and what patients need are two very different things. So Oster drew on her own experience and went in search of the real facts about pregnancy using an economist’s tools. Economics is not just a study of finance. It’s the science of determining value and making informed decisions. To make a good decision, you need to understand the information available to you and to know what it means to you as an individual.
 

So, when applied to a medical topic (like pregnancy) how does this differ from evidence based medicine?  Should I be calling myself an economist? 


None of this mean that Emily shouldn’t write this book.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  our recent discussion  of the problems of considering utility theory as a foundation for economic analysis (which in turn was a reprise of  this post  from last September), somebody named Mark  pointed  me to a 2007 article by Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden, “The road not taken:  How psychology was removed from economics, and how it might be brought back,” which begins:
  
This article explores parallels between the debate prompted by Pareto’s reformulation of choice theory at the beginning of the twentieth century and current controversies about the status of behavioural economics. Before Pareto’s reformulation, neoclassical economics was based on theoretical and experimental psychology, as behavioural economics now is. Current discovered preference defences of rational-choice theory echo arguments made by Pareto. Both treat economics as a separate science of rational choice, independent of psychology. Both confront two fundamental problems: to find a defensible defi</p><p>6 0.79188216 <a title="60-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-15-The_two_faces_of_Erving_Goffman%3A__Subtle_observer_of_human_interactions%2C_and_Smug_organzation_man.html">415 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-15-The two faces of Erving Goffman:  Subtle observer of human interactions, and Smug organzation man</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.

My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.

<p>Introduction: In his  review  in 1938 of  Historical Development of the Graphical Representation of Statistical Data , by H. Gray Funkhauser, for  The Economic Journal , the great economist writes:
  
Perhaps the most striking outcome of Mr. Funkhouser’s researches is the fact of the very slow progress which graphical methods made until quite recently. . . . In the first fifty volumes of the Statistical Journal, 1837-87, only fourteen graphs are printed altogether. It is surprising to be told that Laplace never drew a graph of the normal law of error . . . Edgeworth made no use of statistical charts as distinct from mathematical diagrams.


Apart from Quetelet and Jevons, the most important influences were probably those of Galton and of Mulhall’s Dictionary, first published in 1884. Galton was indeed following his father and grandfather in this field, but his pioneer work was mainly restricted to meteorological maps, and he did not contribute to the development of the graphical representation of ec</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90892005 <a title="60-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>5 0.90098536 <a title="60-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian_analogue_to_stepwise_regression%3F.html">1535 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian analogue to stepwise regression?</a></p>

On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>6 0.89584827 <a title="60-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-%E2%80%9CTexting_bans_don%E2%80%99t_reduce_crashes%3B_effects_are_slight_crash_increases%E2%80%9D.html">307 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-“Texting bans don’t reduce crashes; effects are slight crash increases”</a></p>

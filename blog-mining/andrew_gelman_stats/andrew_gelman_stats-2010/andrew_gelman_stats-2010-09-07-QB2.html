Saw  you had a post  on the research I did with Rob Simmons on the NFL draft.  I have attached the article.  This article has not officially been published, so please don’t post this on-line.


The post you linked to states the following:   “On his blog, Berri says he restricts the analysis to QBs who have played more than 500 downs, or for 5 years. He also looks at per-play statistics, like touchdowns per game, to counter what he considers an opportunity bias.”


Two points:  First of all, we did not look at touchdowns per game (that is not a per play stat).  More importantly —  as this post indicates  — we did far more than just look at data after five years. 


We did mention the five year result, but directly below that discussion (and I mean, directly below), the following sentences appear.

<p>Introduction: Sports researcher Dave Berri had a disagreement with  a remark  in our recent discussion of Malcolm Gladwell.  Berri writes:
  
This post [from Gelman] contains the following paragraph:

 
Similarly, when Gladwell claimed that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college, he appears to have been wrong. But if you take his writing as stone soup, maybe it’s valuable: just retreat to the statement that there’s only a weak relationship between draft order and NFL performance. That alone is interesting. It’s too bad that Gladwell sometimes has to make false general statements in order to get our attention, but maybe that’s what is needed to shake people out of their mental complacency.
 

The above paragraph  links  to a blog post by Eric Loken.  This is something you have linked to before.  And when you linked to it before I tried to explain why Loken’s work is not very good.  Since you still think this work shows that Gladwell – and therefore Rob</p><p>3 0.3495937 <a title="260-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-03-Gladwell_vs_Pinker.html">253 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-03-Gladwell vs Pinker</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>5 0.1370593 <a title="260-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-03-Getting_a_job_in_pro_sports%E2%80%A6_as_a_statistician.html">445 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-03-Getting a job in pro sports… as a statistician</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: This  makes sense:
 
In the land of fiction, it’s the criminal’s modus operandi – his method of entry, his taste for certain jewellery and so forth – that can be used by detectives to identify his handiwork. The reality according to a new analysis of solved burglaries in the Northamptonshire region of England is that these aspects of criminal behaviour are on their own unreliable as identifying markers, most likely because they are dictated by circumstances rather than the criminal’s taste and style. However, the geographical spread and timing of a burglar’s crimes are distinctive, and could help with police investigations.
 
And, as a bonus,  more  Tourette’s pride!
 
P.S.  On yet another unrelated topic from the same blog, I wonder if the researchers in  this study  are aware that  the difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant .</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90164858 <a title="260-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-07-QB2.html">260 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-07-QB2</a></p>

Saw  you had a post  on the research I did with Rob Simmons on the NFL draft.  I have attached the article.  This article has not officially been published, so please don’t post this on-line.


The post you linked to states the following:   “On his blog, Berri says he restricts the analysis to QBs who have played more than 500 downs, or for 5 years. He also looks at per-play statistics, like touchdowns per game, to counter what he considers an opportunity bias.”


Two points:  First of all, we did not look at touchdowns per game (that is not a per play stat).  More importantly —  as this post indicates  — we did far more than just look at data after five years. 


We did mention the five year result, but directly below that discussion (and I mean, directly below), the following sentences appear.

 
Our data set runs from 1970 to 2007 (adjustments were made for how performance changed over time). We also looked at career performance after 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 years</p><p>3 0.89024937 <a title="260-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-30-Berri_Gladwell_Loken_football_update.html">2082 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-30-Berri Gladwell Loken football update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sports researcher Dave Berri had a disagreement with  a remark  in our recent discussion of Malcolm Gladwell.  Berri writes:
  
This post [from Gelman] contains the following paragraph:

 
Similarly, when Gladwell claimed that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college, he appears to have been wrong. But if you take his writing as stone soup, maybe it’s valuable: just retreat to the statement that there’s only a weak relationship between draft order and NFL performance. That alone is interesting. It’s too bad that Gladwell sometimes has to make false general statements in order to get our attention, but maybe that’s what is needed to shake people out of their mental complacency.
 

The above paragraph  links  to a blog post by Eric Loken.  This is something you have linked to before.  And when you linked to it before I tried to explain why Loken’s work is not very good.  Since you still think this work shows that Gladwell – and therefore Rob</p><p>4 0.87964988 <a title="260-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-16-%E2%80%9CIt_doesn%E2%80%99t_matter_if_you_believe_in_God.__What_matters_is_if_God_believes_in_you.%E2%80%9D.html">715 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-16-“It doesn’t matter if you believe in God.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>5 0.87317848 <a title="260-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-19-The_free_cup_and_the_extra_dollar%3A__A_speculation_in_philosophy.html">668 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-19-The free cup and the extra dollar:  A speculation in philosophy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The following is an essay into a topic I know next to nothing about.
 
As part of our endless discussion of Dilbert and Charlie Sheen, commenter Fraac  linked  to a blog by philosopher Edouard Machery, who tells a  fascinating story :
  
How do we think about the intentional nature of actions? And how do people with an impaired mindreading capacity think about it?


Consider the following probes: 


The Free-Cup Case

 
Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, ‘I don’t care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.’ Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a commemorative cup. Did Joe intentionally obtain the commemorative cup?

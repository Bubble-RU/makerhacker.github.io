<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points to an  excellent article  on statistical experimentation by Ron Kohavi, Alex Deng, Brian Frasca, Roger Longbotham, Toby Walker, Ya Xu, a group of software engineers (I presume) at Microsoft.  Kohavi et al. write:
  
Online controlled experiments are often utilized to make data-driven decisions at Amazon, Microsoft . . . deployment and mining of online controlled experiments at scale—thousands of experiments now—has taught us many lessons.
  
The paper is well written and has excellent examples (unfortunately the substantive topics are unexciting things like clicks and revenue per user, but the general principles remain important).  The ideas will be familiar to anyone with experience in practical statistics but don’t always make it into textbooks or courses, so I think many people could learn a lot from this article.  I was disappointed that they didn’t cite much of the statistics literature— not even the classic Box, Hunter, and Hunter book on industrial experimentat</p><p>3 0.18938828 <a title="186-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-02-Experimental_reasoning_in_social_science.html">785 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-02-Experimental reasoning in social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>4 0.14463958 <a title="186-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-03-Another_plagiarism_mystery.html">836 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-03-Another plagiarism mystery</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Cox  comments :
  
I heard of a leading U.S. statistician who delegates some of his book reviews to smart graduate students. The (very grateful) ex-student who told me said, in effect, it’s just his way of working. He makes the deal evident beforehand and makes it up to you in other ways by superb mentoring.
  
I don’t understand this at all!  If the student wrote the review, he or she should be sole author, no?  The thing that puzzles me about this story is that if you’re a “leading statistician,” you don’t really get any credit for reviewing.  If anything, people probably think you’re writing reviews as a way to avoid doing real work.  If there’s some concern that the journal won’t publish a review under the sole authorship of obscure student X, they could always compromise and include the senior prof as a second author on the review (in which case the prof should at least  read  the review and vet it, but that can’t take much time).
 
I guess what I’m saying is that it makes pe</p><p>5 0.11974355 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-06-Another_stereotype_demolished.html">699 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-06-Another stereotype demolished</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  See section 4 of  this article .
 
More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein pointed me to  this  post by Michael Nielsen on how to teach Simpson’s paradox.
 
I don’t know if Nielsen (and others) are aware that people have developed some snappy graphical methods for displaying Simpson’s paradox (and, more generally, aggregation issues).  We do some this in our Red State Blue State book, but before that was the BK plot,  named by Howard Wainer  after a 2001 paper by Stuart Baker and Barnett Kramer, although in apparently appeared earlier in a 1987 paper by Jeon, Chung, and Bae, and doubtless was made by various other people before then.
 
Here’s Wainer’s graphical explication from 2002 (adapted from Baker and Kramer’s 2001 paper):
 
 
 
   
Here’s the version from our 2007 article (with Boris Shor, Joe Bafumi, and David Park):
 
 
 
But I recommend  Wainer’s article  (linked to above) as the first thing to read on the topic of presenting aggregation paradoxes in a clear and grabby way.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  quotes  Bentley University economics professor Scott Sumner  writing  on the first anniversary of his blog:
  
Be careful what you wish for.  Last February 2nd I [Sumner] started this blog with very low expectations… I knew I wasn’t a good writer . . . And I was also pretty sure that the content was not of much interest to anyone.


Now my biggest problem is time–I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the blog, seven days a week.  Several hours are spent responding to reader comments and the rest is spent writing long-winded posts and checking other economics blogs. . . .


I [Sumner] don’t think much of the official methodology in macroeconomics.  Many of my fellow economists seem to have a Popperian view of the social sciences.  You develop a model.  You go out and get some data.  And then you try to refute the model with some sort of regression analysis. . . .


My problem with this view is that it doesn’t reflect the way macro and finance actually work.  Instead the models are</p><p>5 0.71665424 <a title="186-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-23-My_new_writing_strategy.html">727 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-23-My new writing strategy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In high school and college I would write long assignments using a series of outlines.  I’d start with a single sheet where I’d write down the key phrases, connect them with lines, and then write more and more phrases until the page was filled up.  Then I’d write a series of outlines, culminating in a sentence-level outline that was roughly one line per sentence of the paper.  Then I’d write.  It worked pretty well.  Or horribly, depending on how you look at it.  I was able to produce 10-page papers etc. on time.  But I think it crippled my writing style for years.  It’s taken me a long time to learn how to write directly–to explain clearly what I’ve done and why.  And I’m still working on the “why” part.  There’s a thin line between verbosity and terseness.
 
I went to MIT and my roommate was a computer science major.  He wrote me a word processor on his Atari 800, which did the job pretty well.  For my senior thesis I broke down and used the computers in campus.

<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.  But usually I don’t drift too far from reality because I have a lot of cross-checks and I (or my</p><p>2 0.98543298 <a title="186-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-29-Brain_Structure_and_the_Big_Five.html">490 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-29-Brain Structure and the Big Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.  Anyway, I’m pa</p><p>4 0.9790448 <a title="186-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-01-Post-publication_peer_review%3A__How_it_%28sometimes%29_really_works.html">2004 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-01-Post-publication peer review:  How it (sometimes) really works</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an ideal world, research articles would be open to criticism and discussion in the same place where they are published, in a sort of non-corrupt version of Yelp.  What is happening now is that the occasional paper or research area gets lots of press coverage, and this inspires reactions on science-focused blogs.  The trouble here is that it’s easier to give off-the-cuff comments than detailed criticisms.
 
Here’s an example.  It starts a couple years ago with  this article  by Ryota Kanai, Tom Feilden, Colin Firth, and Geraint Rees, on brain size and political orientation:
  
In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants.

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.

Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10 minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of the email appears below).

Akinola Modupe and Katherine Milkman responded to  my email  about  their study :
  
We want to clarify the reason we believe that the use of deception and a lack of informed consent were appropriate and ethical for this research study. In this project, we were studying how the timing of a decision affects discrimination based on race and/or gender.  The emails all participants in our study received were identical except for a) the sender’s name (we used 20 names that pretesting revealed were strongly associated with being either Caucasian, Black, Indian, Chinese or Hispanic, as well as associated with being male or female) and b) whether the meeting requested was for today or for a week from today.  Recipients were randomly selected and were randomly assigned to one of the race/gender/timing conditions.

<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  reported  on the spam email that I received from two business school professors (one at Columbia)!  As noted on the blog, I sent an email directly to the study’s authors at the time of reading the email, but they have yet to respond.
 
This surprises me a bit.  Certainly if 6300 faculty each have time to respond to one email on this study, the two faculty have time to respond to 6300 email replies, no?  I was actually polite enough to respond to  both  of their emails!  If I do hear back, I’ll let youall know!
 
P.S.  Paul Basken interviewed me briefly for  a story  in the Chronicle of Higher Education on the now-notorious spam email study.  Basken’s article is reasonable–he points out that (a) the study irritated a lot of people, but (b) is ultimately no big deal.  
 
One interesting thing about the article is that, although some people felt that the spam email study was ethical, nobody came forth with an argument that the study was actually worth doing.

<p>Introduction: John Sides  points  to this discussion (with over 200 comments!) by political scientist Charli Carpenter of her response to a student from another university who emailed with questions that look like they come from a homework assignment.  Here’s the student’s original  email :
  
Hi Mr. Carpenter,


I am a fourth year college student and I have the honor of reading one of your books and I just had a few questions… I am very fascinated by your work and I am just trying to understand everything. Can you please address some of my questions? I would greatly appreciate it. It certainly help me understand your wonderful article better. Thank you very much! :)


1. What is the fundamental purpose of your article?


2. What is your fundamental thesis?


3. What evidence do you use to support your thesis?


4. What is the overall conclusion?


5. Do you feel that you have a fair balance of opposing viewpoints?


Sincerely,

To viewers of Dr. Andrew Gelman’s blog,


I [Wallsten] am pleased to invite you to participate in an important research project to develop improved methods for predicting future events and outcomes. More specifically, our goal is to develop methods for aggregating many individual judgments in a manner that yields more accurate predictions than any one person or small group alone could provide. Our research is funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity (IARPA,  iarpa.gov ), but its application will extend far beyond intelligence to such areas as business forecasting or medical diagnosis. Our team consists of researchers at ARA, a private company; as well as researchers at the University of Maryland-College Park, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Fordham University, University of California-Irvine, Wake Forest University, and the University of Missouri. Details can be found at forecastingace.com/ .

<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

<p>Introduction: As someone who relies strongly on survey research, it’s good for me to be reminded that some surveys are useful, some are useless, but one thing they almost all have in common is . . . they waste the respondents’ time.
 
I thought of this after receiving the following email, which I shall reproduce here.  My own comments appear after.
     
Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10 minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of the email appears below). We are emailing you today to debrief you on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study. We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced. Our hope is that this letter will provide a sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of our study to alleviate any concerns you may have about your involvement.

is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?  I [Bergman] have a sample size of roughly 400 people, and several binary variables correlate strongly with the outcome of interest and would also define interesting subgroups for analysis.  The problem is, stratifying over all of these (five or six) variables leaves me with strata that have only 1 person in them.  I have done some background reading on whether there is a rule of thumb for the maximum number of variables to stratify.  There does not seem to be much agreement (some say there should be between N/50-N/100 strata, others say as few as possible).  In economics, the paper I looked to is here, which seems to summarize literature related to clinical trials.  In short, my question is: is it bad to have several strata with 1 person in them? Should I group these people in with another stratum?

<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line Technology and Engineering Research:
  
Dear Editor 


We have done research in some of the cutting edge technology and engineering field and would like to if you will be able to write about it in your news section. 
Our Primarily research focus on building high performance systems that are helping in social networks, web, finding disease, cancer and sports using BIG DATA . Hope to hear from you some time soon. 


Thanks,

<p>Introduction: William Perkins, Mark Tygert, and Rachel Ward  write :
  
If a discrete probability distribution in a model being tested for goodness-of-fit is not close to uniform, then forming the Pearson χ2 statistic can involve division by nearly zero. This often leads to serious trouble in practice — even in the absence of round-off errors . . .
  
The problem is not merely that the chi-squared  statistic  doesn’t have the advertised chi-squared  distribution —a reference distribution can always be computed via simulation, either using the posterior predictive distribution or by conditioning on a point estimate of the cell expectations and then making a degrees-of-freedom sort of adjustment.
 
Rather, the problem is that, when there are lots of cells with near-zero expectation, the chi-squared test is mostly noise.
 
And this is not merely a theoretical problem.  It comes up in real examples.

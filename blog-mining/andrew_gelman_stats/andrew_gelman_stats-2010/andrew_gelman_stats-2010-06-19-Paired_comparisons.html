When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days, what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game?

Dan writes:
  
We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting. The answers came in between 65% and 70%.






The true answer [based on Dan's analysis of a database of baseball games]: 51.3%, a little better than a coin toss.
  
I have to say, I’m surprised his colleagues gave such extreme guesses.  I was guessing something like 50%, myself, based on the following very crude reasoning:
 
Suppose two unequal teams are playing, and the chance of team A beating team B is 55%.  (This seems like a reasonable average of all matchups, which will include some more extreme disparities but also many more equal contests.)  Then the chance of the same team</p><p>4 0.11530489 <a title="99-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-17-Sports_examples_in_class.html">1173 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-17-Sports examples in class</a></p>

I [Karl] personally would avoid sports entirely, as I view the subject to be insufficiently serious. . . . Certainly lots of statisticians are interested in sports. . . . And I’m not completely uninterested in sports: I like to watch football, particularly Nebraska, Green Bay, and Baltimore, and to see Notre Dame or any team from Florida or Texas lose.


But statistics about sports? Yawn.
  
As a person who loves sports, statistics, and sports statistics, I have a few thoughts:
 
1.  Not everyone likes sports, and even fewer are interested in any particular sport.  It’s ok to use sports examples, but don’t delude yourself into thinking that everyone in the class cares about it.
 
2.  Don’t forget foreign students.  A lot of them don’t even know the rules of kickball, fer chrissake!
 
3.  Of the students who care about a sport, there will be a minority who  really  care.  We had some serious basketball fans in our class last year.

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>6 0.1137388 <a title="99-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-25-College_football%2C_voting%2C_and_the_law_of_large_numbers.html">1547 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-25-College football, voting, and the law of large numbers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I know next to nothing about golf.  My mini-golf scores typically approach the maximum of 7 per hole, and I’ve never actually played macro-golf.  I did publish a paper on golf once ( A Probability Model for Golf Putting , with Deb Nolan), but it’s not so rare for people to publish papers on topics they know nothing about.  Those who can’t, research.
 
But I certainly have the ability to post other people’s ideas.  Charles Murray writes:
  
I [Murray] am playing around with the likelihood of Tiger Woods breaking Nicklaus’s record in the Majors. I’ve already gone on record  two years ago  with the reason why he won’t, but now I’m looking at it from a non-psychological perspective. Given the history of the majors, what how far above the average _for other great golfers_ does Tiger have to perform?


Here’s the procedure I’ve been working on:

<p>Introduction: From a commenter on the web, 21 May 2010:
  
Tampa Bay:  Playing .732 ball in the toughest division in baseball, wiped their feet on NY twice.  If they sweep Houston, which seems pretty likely, they will be at .750, which I [the commenter] have never heard of. 
  
At the time of that posting, the Rays were 30-11.  Quick calculation:  if a team is good enough to be expected to win 100 games, that is, Pr(win) = 100/162 = .617, then there’s a 5% chance that they’ll have won at least 30 of their first 41 games.  That’s a calculation based on simple probability theory of independent events, which isn’t quite right here but will get you close and is a good way to  train one’s intuition , I think.
 
Having a .732 record after 41 games is not unheard-of.  The Detroit Tigers won 35 of their first 40 games in 1984:  that’s .875.  (I happen to remember that fast start, having been an Orioles fan at the time.)

I’d like to request general feedback and references for a problem of combining disparate data sources in a regression model. We’d like to model log crop yield as a function of environmental predictors, but the observations come from many data sources and are peculiarly structured. Among the issues are:


1. Measurement precision in predictors and outcome varies widely with data sources. Some observations are in very coarse units of measurement, due to rounding or even observer guesswork. 


2. There are obvious clusters of observations arising from studies in which crop yields were monitored over successive years in spatially proximate communities. Thus some variables may be constant within clusters–this is true even for log yield, probably due to rounding of similar yields. 


3. Cluster size and intra-cluster association structure (temporal, spatial or both) vary widely across the dataset.

<p>Introduction: Robert Birkelbach:
  
I am writing my Bachelor Thesis in which I want to assess the reading competencies of German elementary school children using the PIRLS2006 data. My levels are classrooms and the individuals. However, my dependent variable is a multiple imputed (m=5) reading test. The problem I have is, that I do not know, whether I can just calculate 5 linear multilevel models and then average all the results (the coefficients, standard deviation, bic, intra class correlation, R2, t-statistics, p-values etc) or if I need different formulas for integrating the results of the five models into one because it is a multilevel analysis? Do you think there’s a better way in solving my problem? I would greatly appreciate if you could help me with a problem regarding my analysis — I am quite a newbie to multilevel modeling and especially to multiple imputation. Also: Is it okay to use frequentist models when the multiple imputation was done bayesian?

<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: These  (from Shaun Usher) are surprisingly good, especially since he appears to come up with new lists and letters pretty regularly.  I suppose a lot of them get sent in from readers, but still.
 
Here’s my favorite recent item, a  letter  sent to the Seattle Bureau of Prohibition in 1931:
  
Dear Sir:


My husband is in the habit of buying a quart of wiskey every other day from a Chinese bootlegger named Chin Waugh living at 317-16th near Alder street.


We need this money for household expenses. Will you please have his place raided? He keeps a supply planted in the garden and a smaller quantity under the back steps for quick delivery. If you make the raid at 9:30 any morning you will be sure to get the goods and Chin also as he leaves the house at 10 o’clock and may clean up before he goes.


Thanking you in advance, 


I remain 
yours truly,


Mrs. Hillyer</p><p>3 0.95708245 <a title="99-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-12-The_Wald_method_has_been_the_subject_of_extensive_criticism_by_statisticians_for_exaggerating_results%E2%80%9D.html">410 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-12-The Wald method has been the subject of extensive criticism by statisticians for exaggerating results”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>4 0.95328581 <a title="99-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-There_are_never_70_distinct_parameters.html">327 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-There are never 70 distinct parameters</a></p>

I’m a graduate student in computational biology, and I’m relatively new to advanced statistics, and am trying to teach myself how best to approach a problem I have.


My dataset is a small sparse matrix of 150 cases and 70 predictors, it is sparse as in many zeros, not many ‘NA’s.  Each case is a nutrient that is fed into an in silico organism, and its response is whether or not it stimulates growth, and each predictor is one of 70 different pathways that the nutrient may or may not belong to.  Because all of the nutrients do not belong to all of the pathways, there are thus many zeros in my matrix.  My goal is to be able to use the pathways themselves to predict whether or not a nutrient could stimulate growth, thus I wanted to compute regression coefficients for each pathway, with which I could apply to other nutrients for other species.


There are quite a few singularities in the dataset (summary(glm) reports that 14 coefficients are not defined because of sin</p><p>same-blog 5 0.94905829 <a title="99-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Paired_comparisons.html">99 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Paired comparisons</a></p>

I’ve got a stat problem I’d like to run past you. It’s one of those annoying problems that feels like it should be obvious but the solution has evaded me and the colleagues I’ve discussed it with. I’m working on a project where the metric of interest is defined in relation to pairs of data points. It has nothing to do with sports or betting but the following analogy (which I also post on the blog) covers the basic situation:


“You want to build a model predicting the spread for games in a new football league. Because the line-up of teams is still in flux, you decide to use only stats from individual teams as inputs (for example, an indicator variable for when the Ambushers play the Ravagers would not be allowed).”


Is there a standard approach for modeling this kind of data?
  
My reply:  I don’t quite understand your question, but are you familiar with the Bradley-Terry and Thurstone-Mosteller models for paired comparisons?

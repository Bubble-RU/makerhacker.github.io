<p>Introduction: From Anthony Burgess’s review of “The Batsford Companion to Popular Literature,” by Victor Neuberg:
  
Arthur J. Burks (1898-1974) was no gentleman.  During the 1930s, when he would sometimes have nearly two million words in current publication, he aimed at producing 18,000 words a day.

 
Editors would call me up and ask me to do a novelette by the next afternoon, and I would, but it nearly killed me. . . .  I once appeared on the covers of eleven magazines the same month, and then almost killed myself for years trying to make it twelve.  I never did.
 

[Masanao:   I think you know where I'm heading with that story.]


Ursula Bloom, born 1985 and still with us [this was written sometime between 1978 and 1985], is clearly no lady.  Writing also under the pseudonyms of Lozania Prole (there’s an honest name for you), Sheila Burnes and Mary Essex, she has produced 486 boooks, beginning with  Tiger  at the age of seven. . . .

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins  writes :
  
When native Australians or New Guineans say that their totemic animals and plants are their kinsmen – that these species are persons like themselves, and that in offering them to others they are giving away part of their own substance – we have to take them seriously, which is to say empirically, if we want to understand the large consequences of these facts for how they organise their lives. The graveyard of ethnographic studies is strewn with the remains of reports which, thanks to anthropologists’ own presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact, were content to ignore or debunk the Amazonian peoples who said that the animals they hunted were their brothers-in-law, the Africans who described the way they systematically killed their kings when they became weak, or the Fijian chiefs who claimed they were gods.
  
My first thought was . . . wait a minute!  Whazzat with “presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact”?

<p>Introduction: I was talking with a colleague about one of our research projects and said that I would write something up, if blogging didn’t get in the way.  She suggested that for the next month I just blog about my research ideas.
 
So I think I’ll do that.  This means no mocking of plagiarists, no reflections on literature, no answers to miscellaneous questions about how many groups you need in a multilevel model, no rants about economists, no links to pretty graphs, etc., for 30 days.
 
Meanwhile, I have a roughly 30-day backlog.  So after my next 30 days of stat blogging, the backlog will gradually appear.  There’s some good stuff there, including reflections on Milos, a (sincere) tribute to the haters, an updated Twitteo Killed the Bloggio Star, a question about acupuncture, and some remote statistical modeling advice I gave that actually worked!  I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.
 
But you’ll have to wait for all that fun stuff.  For the next thirty days, it’s statistics research every day.

<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>5 0.81513381 <a title="17-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-16-Is_parenting_a_form_of_addiction%3F.html">416 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-16-Is parenting a form of addiction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The last time we encountered Slate columnist Shankar Vedantam was when he  puzzled over  why slightly more than half of voters planned to vote for Republican candidates, given that polls show that Americans dislike the Republican Party even more than they dislike the Democrats.  Vedantam attributed the new Republican majority to irrationality and “unconscious bias.”  But, actually, this voting behavior is perfectly consistent with there being some moderate voters who prefer divided government.  The simple, direct explanation (which Vedantam mistakenly dismisses) actually works fine.
 
I was flipping through Slate today and noticed a  new article  by Vedantam headlined, “If parenthood sucks, why do we love it? Because we’re addicted.”  I don’t like this one either.
  

 
Vedantam starts by reviewing the evidence that people with kids are less happy than people without kids and that parents report that they are unhappy when they are around their young children.  Given this, Vedantam asks</p><p>6 0.81200641 <a title="17-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-Laws_as_expressive.html">1085 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-Laws as expressive</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.
 
Here’s a quick graph; there’s more in the article:</p><p>3 0.89757156 <a title="17-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-28-Brow_inflation.html">489 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-28-Brow inflation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>4 0.88224077 <a title="17-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Boris_was_right.html">44 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Boris was right</a></p>

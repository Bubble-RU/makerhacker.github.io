<p>Introduction: Nick Obradovich saw  our graphs and regressions  showing that the most popular governors tended to come from small states and suggested looking at unemployment rates.  (I’d used change in per-capita income as my economic predictor, following the usual practice in political science.)
 
Here’s the graph that got things started:
 
   
 
And here’s what Obradovich wrote:
  
It seems that average unemployment rate is more strongly negatively correlated with positive governor approval ratings than is population.  The unemployment rate and state size is positively correlated.


Anyway, when I include state unemployment rate in the regressions, it pulls the significance away from state population.  I do economic data work much of the day, so when I read your post this morning and looked at your charts, state unemployment rates jumped right out at me as a potential confound.
  
I passed this suggestion on to Hanfei, who ran some regressions:

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>4 0.133517 <a title="323-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-22-Americans_think_economy_isn%E2%80%99t_so_bad_in_their_city_but_is_crappy_nationally_and_globally.html">1388 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-22-Americans think economy isn’t so bad in their city but is crappy nationally and globally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Frank Newport of Gallup  reports  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Americans become progressively less positive about economic conditions the farther away from home they look. Forty-nine percent rate economic conditions in their local area as excellent or good, but that drops to 25% when rating the U.S. economy, and to 13% when assessing the world as a whole.
  
This is really wack:
 
   
 
I can see how it might make sense for Americans to think conditions are worse in other countries, but it’s hard to see a rational reason for the Lake-Wobegon-like pattern of people thinking things are ok locally but not nationally.
 
Gallup highlights the partisan breakdown, which I graphed here:
 
   
 
Unsurprisingly (given that their party controls the presidency and one house of Congress), Democrats are more optimistic than Republicans.  This is just the flip side of University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan claiming in October 2008 that the economy is not that bad because “the current unem</p><p>5 0.11902776 <a title="323-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-13-Jim_Campbell_argues_that_Larry_Bartels%E2%80%99s_%E2%80%9CUnequal_Democracy%E2%80%9D_findings_are_not_robust.html">659 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-13-Jim Campbell argues that Larry Bartels’s “Unequal Democracy” findings are not robust</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few years ago Larry Bartels  presented  this graph, a version of which latter appeared in his book Unequal Democracy:
 
 
 
Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy. This is consistent with Democrats’ general policies of lowering unemployment, as compared to Republicans lowering inflation, and, by comparing first-term to second-term presidents, he found that the result couldn’t simply be explained as a rebound or alternation pattern.
 
The question then arose, why have the Republicans won so many elections? Why aren’t the Democrats consistently dominating? Non-economic issues are part of the story, of course, but lots of evidence shows the economy to be a key concern for voters, so it’s still hard to see how, with a pattern such as shown above, the Republicans could keep winning.
 
Larry had some explanations, largely having to do with timing:  under De</p><p>6 0.098889403 <a title="323-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states. In light of this correlation, would you say that there currently is</p><p>4 0.73281652 <a title="323-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-22-Political_Belief_Networks%3A__Socio-cognitive_Heterogeneity_in_American_Public_Opinion.html">1 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-22-Political Belief Networks:  Socio-cognitive Heterogeneity in American Public Opinion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Delia Baldassarri and Amir Goldberg  write :
  
Americans’ political beliefs present a long observed paradox. Whereas the mainstream political discourse is structured on a clearly defined polarity between conservative and liberal views, in practice, most people exhibit ideologically incoherent belief patterns. This paper challenges the notion that political beliefs are necessarily defined by a singular ideological continuum. It applies a new, network-based method for detecting heterogeneity in collective patterns of opinion, relational class analysis (RCA), to Americans’ political attitudes as captured by the American National Election Studies. By refraining from making a-priori assumptions about how beliefs are interconnected, RCA looks for opinion structures, belief networks, that are not necessarily congruent with received wisdom. It finds that in the twenty years between 1984 and 2004 Americans’ political attitudes were consistently structured by two alternative belief systems: one</p><p>5 0.72510856 <a title="323-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stephen Ansolabehere, Marc Meredith, and Erik Snowberg  write :
  
The literature on economic voting notes that voters’ subjective evaluations of the overall state of the economy are correlated with vote choice, whereas personal economic experiences are not. Missing from this literature is a description of how voters acquire information about the general state of the economy, and how that information is used to form perceptions. In order to begin understanding this process, we [Ansolabehere, Meredith, and Snowberg] asked a series of questions on the 2006 ANES Pilot about respondents’ perceptions of the average price of gas and the unemployment rate in their home state.


We find that questions about gas prices and unemployment show differences in the sources of information about these two economic variables. Information about unemployment rates come from media sources, and are systematically biased by partisan factors. Information about gas prices, in contrast, comes only from everyday</p><p>2 0.8829633 <a title="323-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-19-Free_%245_gift_certificate%21.html">667 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-19-Free $5 gift certificate!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.  Anyway, I’m pa</p><p>4 0.86316305 <a title="323-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-29-Brain_Structure_and_the_Big_Five.html">490 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-29-Brain Structure and the Big Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.  Yes, there is less turnover th</p><p>6 0.80713534 <a title="323-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Forensic_bioinformatics%2C_or%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_believe_everything_you_read_in_the_%28scientific%29_papers.html">360 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Forensic bioinformatics, or, Don’t believe everything you read in the (scientific) papers</a></p>

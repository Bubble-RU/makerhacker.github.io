On the plus side, the pictures and associated movie (showing an oddly horizontally-stretched-out United States) are pretty and seem to have gotten a bit of attention–the maps have received 31 comments, which is more than we get on almost all our blog entries here.
 
On the minus side, the movie is misleading.  In many years it shows the whole U.S. as a single color, even when candidates from both parties won some votes.  The text has errors too, for example the false claim that the South favored a Democratic candidate in 1980.  The southern states that Jimmy Carter carried in 1980 were Georgia and . . . that’s it.
 
But, as Aleks says, once this tool is out there, maybe people can use it to do better.  It’s in that spirit that I’m linking.  Ya gotta start somewhere.
 
Also, this is a good example of a general principle:  When you make a graph, look at it carefully to see if it makes sense!</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Aleks points me to  this attractive visualization  by David Sparks of U.

The text has errors too, for example the false claim that the South favored a Democratic candidate in 1980.  The southern states that Jimmy Carter carried in 1980 were Georgia and . . . that’s it.
 
But, as Aleks says, once this tool is out there, maybe people can use it to do better.  It’s in that spirit that I’m linking.  Ya gotta start somewhere.

To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>4 0.92349714 <a title="428-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram_on_Mandelbrot.html">1784 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram on Mandelbrot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: I have a great idea for a movie.  Actually two movies based on two variants of a similar idea.
 
It all started when I saw this story:
  
Dr. Anil Potti, the controversial cancer researcher whose work at Duke University led to lawsuits from patients, is now a medical oncologist at the Cancer Center of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
  
When asked about Dr. Potti’s controversial appointment, his new boss  said :
  
If a guy can’t get a second chance here in North Dakota, where he trained, man, you can’t get a second chance anywhere.
  
(Link from  Retraction Watch , of course.)
 
Potti’s boss is also quoted as saying, “Most, if not all, his patients have loved him.”  On the other hand, the news article reports: “The North Carolina medical board’s website lists settlements against Potti of at least $75,000.”  I guess there’s no reason you can’t love a guy and still want a juicy malpractice settlement.

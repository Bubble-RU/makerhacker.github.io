<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.1339419 <a title="219-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-Is_it_rational_to_vote%3F.html">837 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-Is it rational to vote?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hear me interviewed on the topic  here .
 
P.S.  The interview was fine but I donâ&euro;&trade;t agree with everything on the linked website.  For example,  this  bit:
  
Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.  Global warming has many of the characteristics of a popular delusion, an irrational fear or cause that is embraced by millions of people because, well, it is believed by millions of people!
  
All right, then.</p><p>4 0.13305707 <a title="219-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-31-Skepticism_about_skepticism_of_global_warming_skepticism_skepticism.html">983 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-31-Skepticism about skepticism of global warming skepticism skepticism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A group of University of California professors headed by physicist Richard Muller recently released a  report  confirming global warming.  Then geophysicist Judith Curry, a coauthor on the papers produced by the Muller group, turned around and  said  that their data actually show that global warming has stopped.  (Also see clarification  here .)
 
Curry is described in the news article as the second author on the papers, but the authors are listed alphabetically so it’s probably more accurate to describe her as one of the ten authors.  Muller’s one, Curry’s another, . . . now I want to know what 7 of the other 8 authors think!  (One of the authors is Richard Muller’s daughter Elizabeth, so maybe we shouldn’t count her as an independent view.)
 
Some enterprising reporter should really interview the other 7 authors of  that report .  Just a quick question like, “Is there scientific basis for saying that warming hasn’t stopped?”

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>6 0.12478559 <a title="219-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40_Nation.html">1569 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-30-30-40 Nation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Harold Pollack writes:
  
 
Over the past three years, we have experienced an amazing number of political, economic, and legislative trials. I suppose it’s human nature to respond to such events by doubling down on our own prior strongly-held beliefs. Health care reform/TARP/stimulus, whatever–that proves that I am even more right than I thought I was!


That’s really too bad. We’ve been through some hard trials recently, in multiple senses. We’ve been tested by difficult times. We’ve also had the opportunity to see many of our beliefs tested through real-world experiments that should challenge our ideological, strategic, and policy views. Anyone active and attentive should be thinking differently about _something_ important after having witnessed so much history being made so quickly on so many different fronts.


Have your own views changed on any basic issues of domestic policy? I’m not so much interested in your assessment of particular politicians or specific political tactics.

Gronke et al. write (as excerpted by Sides):
  
Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.

<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>5 0.77403355 <a title="219-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-20-No_no_no_no_no.html">1020 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-20-No no no no no</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.  The disturbing thing about the whole process wasn’t so much that the Tea Partiers were irrational as that th</p><p>6 0.74910492 <a title="219-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_think_we_get_much_out_of_framing_politics_as_the_Tragic_Vision_vs._the_Utopian_Vision.html">1892 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-10-I don’t think we get much out of framing politics as the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Back when I taught at Berkeley, I once asked a Ph.D. student how he’d decided to work with me.  He said that a couple of the tenured professors had advised him not to take my class, and that this advice had got him curious:  What about  Bayesian statistics is so dangerous that it can scare these otherwise unflappable stat professors.  Overall, my senior colleagues’ advice to students to avoid my course probably decreased my enrollment, but the students who  did  decide to attend surely had better character than the ones who followed directions.  (Or, at least I’d like to think that.)
 
I was reminded of that incident recently when reading a  news article  by Marc Tracy:
  
A U.S. Department of Education committee is investigating whether a Columbia University department head “steered” a Jewish student away from taking a class on the Mideast taught by Professor Joseph Massad due to the perception that she would be “uncomfortable” because of the professor’s pro-Palestinian tilt . . . “Ba</p><p>3 0.95863706 <a title="219-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-10-The_blog_of_the_Cultural_Cognition_Project.html">1111 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-10-The blog of the Cultural Cognition Project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan and colleagues  write :
  
The Cultural Cognition Project is a group of scholars interested in studying how cultural values shape public risk perceptions and related policy beliefs.   Cultural cognition refers to the tendency of individuals to conform their beliefs about disputed matters of fact (e.g., whether global warming is a serious threat; whether the death penalty deters murder; whether gun control makes society more safe or less) to values that define their cultural identities. Project members are using the methods of various disciplines — including social psychology, anthropology, communications, and political science — to chart the impact of this phenomenon and to identify the mechanisms through which it operates. The Project also has an explicit normative objective: to identify processes of democratic decisionmaking by which society can resolve culturally grounded differences in belief in a manner that is both congenial to persons of diverse cultural outlooks and c</p><p>4 0.95525491 <a title="219-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Doug_Hibbs_on_the_fundamentals_in_2010.html">292 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Doug Hibbs on the fundamentals in 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010. The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>same-blog 5 0.95454258 <a title="219-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-20-Some_things_are_just_really_hard_to_believe%3A_more_on_choosing_your_facts..html">219 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-20-Some things are just really hard to believe: more on choosing your facts.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to think that Barack Obama is a Muslim and was born in Kenya.  But why?  People choose to be Republicans or Democrats because they prefer the policy or ideology of one party or another, and it’s not obvious that there should be any connection whatsoever between those factors and their judgment of a  factual  matter such as Obama’s religion or country of birth.  
 
In fact, people on opposite sides of many issues, such as gay marriage, immigration policy, global warming, and continued U.S. presence in Iraq, tend to disagree, often by a huge amount, on factual matters such as whether the children of gay couples have more psychological problems than the children of straight couples, what are the economic impacts of illegal immigration, what is the effect of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and so on. 
 
Of course, it makes sense that people with different judgment of the facts would have different views on policies: if you think ca</p><p>6 0.95313448 <a title="219-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-23-Life_in_the_C-suite%3A__A_graph_that_is_both_ugly_and_bad%2C_and_an_unrelated_story.html">1734 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-23-Life in the C-suite:  A graph that is both ugly and bad, and an unrelated story</a></p>

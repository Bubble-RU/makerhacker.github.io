<p>Introduction: From two years  ago :
  
Awhile ago I was cleaning out the closet and found some old unread magazines.  Good stuff.  As we’ve discussed  before , lots of things are better read a few years late.


Today I was reading the 18 Nov 2004 issue of the London Review of Books, which contained (among other things) the following:


- A review by Jenny Diski of a biography of Stanley Milgram.  Diski appears to want to debunk:

 
Milgram was a whiz at devising sexy experiments, but barely interested in any theoretical basis for them.  They all have the same instant attractiveness of style, and then an underlying emptiness.
 

Huh?  Michael Jordan couldn’t hit the curveball and he was reportedly an easy mark for golf hustlers but that doesn’t diminish his greatness on the basketball court.


She also criticizes Milgram for being “no help at all” for solving international disputes.  OK, fine.  I haven’t solved any international disputes either.

 Chapter 1 


On Sunday we were over on 125 St so I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Jesus Taco was next door so I went there instead.  What a mistake!  I don’t know what Masanao and Yu-Sung could’ve been thinking.  Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn’t impress me).  I’m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I’m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn’t tell anyone.  I can’t really figure out why I’m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.  It’s a good deal:  they’re small but not that small.  Sure, I ate 6 of them, but I was h</p><p>6 0.10023835 <a title="164-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-Bayes_in_China_update.html">517 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-Bayes in China update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few years ago we went to a nearby fried chicken place that the Village Voice had raved about.  While we were waiting to place our order, someone from the local Chinese takeout place came in with a delivery, which the employees of the chicken place proceeded to eat.  This shouldâ&euro;&trade;ve been our signal to leave.  Instead, we bought some chicken.  It was terrible.</p><p>2 0.82425904 <a title="164-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-22-Mister_P_gets_married.html">224 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-22-Mister P gets married</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff, Justin, and I  write :
  
Gay marriage is not going away as a highly emotional, contested issue. Proposition 8, the California ballot measure that bans same-sex marriage, has seen to that, as it winds its way through the federal courts.  But perhaps the public has reached a turning point.

<p>Introduction: Frank Wood and Nick Bartlett  write :
  
Deplump works the same as all probabilistic lossless compressors. A datastream is fed one observation at a time into a predictor which emits both the data stream and predictions about what the next observation in the stream should be for every observation. An encoder takes this output and produces a compressed stream which can be piped over a network or to a file. A receiver then takes this stream and decompresses it by doing everything in reverse. In order to ensure that the decoder has the same information available to it that the encoder had when compressing the stream, the decoded datastream is both emitted and directed to another predictor. This second predictor’s job is to produce exactly the same predictions as the initial predictor so that the decoder has the same information at every step of the process as the encoder did.


The difference between probabilistic lossless compressors is in the prediction engine, encoding and decoding bein</p><p>4 0.67869115 <a title="164-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-17-Yes%2C_your_wish_shall_be_granted_%28in_25_years%29.html">665 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-17-Yes, your wish shall be granted (in 25 years)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one  was so beautiful I just had to repost it:
 
From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

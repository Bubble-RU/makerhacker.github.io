<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
Eric Archer forwarded  this document  by Nick Freemantle, “The Reverend Bayes—was he really a prophet?”, in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine:

 

Does [Bayes's] contribution merit the enthusiasms of his followers? Or is his legacy overhyped? . . .


First, Bayesians appear to have an absolute right to disapprove of any conventional approach in statistics without offering a workable alternative—for example, a colleague recently stated at a meeting that ‘. . . it is OK to have multiple comparisons because Bayesians’ don’t believe in alpha spending’. . . .


Second, Bayesians appear to build an army of straw men—everything it seems is different and better from a Bayesian perspective, although many of the concepts seem remarkably familiar. For example, a very well known Bayesian statistician recently surprised the audience with his discovery of the P value as a useful Bayesian statistic at a meeting in Birmingham.


Third, Bayesians possess enormous enthusiasm fo</p><p>4 0.21082538 <a title="117-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-26-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">110 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-26-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s an article  that I believe is flat-out entertaining to read.  It’s about philosophy, so it’s supposed to be entertaining, in any case.
 
Here’s the abstract:
  
A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.






Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but</p><p>5 0.205844 <a title="117-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>3 0.92840004 <a title="117-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-11-Why_waste_time_philosophizing%3F.html">1719 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-11-Why waste time philosophizing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll answer the above question after first sharing some background and history on the the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, which appeared at the end of our  rejoinder  to the discussion to which I  linked  the other day:
  
When we were beginning our statistical educations, the word ‘Bayesian’ conveyed membership in an obscure cult. Statisticians who were outside the charmed circle could ignore the Bayesian subfield, while Bayesians themselves tended to be either apologetic or brazenly defiant. These two extremes manifested themselves in ever more elaborate proposals for non-informative priors, on the one hand, and declarations of the purity of subjective probability, on the other.


Much has changed in the past 30 years. ‘Bayesian’ is now often used in casual scientific parlance as a synonym for ‘rational’, the anti-Bayesians have mostly disappeared, and non-Bayesian statisticians feel the need to keep up with developments in Bayesian modelling and computation.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo recommended that I consider coming up with a new name for the statistical methods that I used, given that the term “Bayesian” has all sorts of associations that I dislike (as discussed, for example, in section 1 of  this article ).
 
I replied that I agree on Bayesian, I never liked the term and always wanted something better, but I couldn’t think of any convenient alternative.  Also, I was finding that Bayesians (even the Bayesians I disagreed with) were reading my research articles, while non-Bayesians were simply ignoring them.  So I thought it was best to identify with, and communicate with, those people who were willing to engage with me.
 
More formally, I’m happy defining “Bayesian” as “using inference from the posterior distribution, p(theta|y)”.  This says nothing about where the probability distributions come from (thus, no requirement to be “subjective” or “objective”) and it says nothing about the models (thus, no requirement to use the discrete models that hav</p><p>5 0.91914731 <a title="117-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>

Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this?

My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.

On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>4 0.95342004 <a title="117-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>5 0.94852841 <a title="117-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-30-That_puzzle-solving_feeling.html">492 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-30-That puzzle-solving feeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>6 0.94303024 <a title="117-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-15-1-2_social_scientist_%2B_1-2_politician_%3D_%3F%3F%3F.html">713 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-15-1-2 social scientist + 1-2 politician = ???</a></p>

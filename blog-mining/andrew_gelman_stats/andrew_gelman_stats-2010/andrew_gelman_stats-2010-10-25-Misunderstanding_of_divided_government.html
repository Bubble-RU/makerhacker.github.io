</p><p>15 But it’s hardly irrational for voters to be strategic and to not merely “simply pick the candidate they like. [sent-34, score-0.428]

</p><p>20 Whether the argument is that whites voted for Obama because it made them feel good about themselves, or that people are planning to vote Republican in 2010 because “our unconscious bias favors action over holding steady, regardless of whether that makes sense,” my response is:  Maybe so.

<p>Introduction: The last time we encountered Slate columnist Shankar Vedantam was when he  puzzled over  why slightly more than half of voters planned to vote for Republican candidates, given that polls show that Americans dislike the Republican Party even more than they dislike the Democrats.  Vedantam attributed the new Republican majority to irrationality and “unconscious bias.”  But, actually, this voting behavior is perfectly consistent with there being some moderate voters who prefer divided government.  The simple, direct explanation (which Vedantam mistakenly dismisses) actually works fine.
 
I was flipping through Slate today and noticed a  new article  by Vedantam headlined, “If parenthood sucks, why do we love it? Because we’re addicted.”  I don’t like this one either.
  

 
Vedantam starts by reviewing the evidence that people with kids are less happy than people without kids and that parents report that they are unhappy when they are around their young children.  Given this, Vedantam asks</p><p>3 0.27858582 <a title="369-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.24663873 <a title="369-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>5 0.22723877 <a title="369-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.

<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on.

By nearly all accounts, the Republicans looks set to take over the US House of Representatives in next week’s November 2010 general election. . . . Republicans, in this wave election that recalls 1994, look set to win not just swing districts, but also those districts that have been traditionally Democratic, or those with strong or longtime Democratic incumbents. Naturally, just as in 2008, this has led to overclaiming by jubilant conservatives and distraught liberals-though the adjectives were then reversed-that this portends a realignment in American politics. . . .


Republican moderates in Congress are often associated with two factors: 1) a liberal voting record earlier in their career, and 2) a liberal district. Of course, both are related, in the sense that ambitious moderates choose liberal districts to run in, and liberal districts weed out conservative candidates. . . .

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: Within any education category, richer people vote more Republican. In contrast, the pattern of education and voting is nonlinear. High school graduates are more Republican than non-HS grads, but after that, the groups with more education tend to vote more Democratic. At the very highest education level tabulated in the survey, voters with post-graduate degrees lean toward the Democrats. Except for the rich post-graduates; they are split 50-50 between the parties.
 
What does this say about America’s elites? If you define elites as high-income non-Hispanic whites, the elites vote strongly Republican. If you define elites as college-educated high-income whites, they vote moderately Republican.
 
There is no plausible way based on these data in which elites can be considered a Democratic voting bloc. To create a group of strongly Democratic-leaning elite whites using these graphs, you would need to consider only postgraduates (no simple college grads included, even if they have achieved s</p><p>6 0.81873244 <a title="369-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-A_question_about_voting_systems%E2%80%94unrelated_to_U.S._elections%21.html">1566 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-A question about voting systems—unrelated to U.S. elections!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Shankar Vedantam  writes :
  
Americans distrust the GOP. So why are they voting for it? . . . Gallup tells us that 71 percent of all Americans blame Republican policies for the bad economy, while only 48 percent blame the Obama administration. . . . while disapproval of congressional Democrats stands at 61 percent, disapproval of congressional Republicans stands at 67 percent.


[But] Republicans are heavily tipped to wrest control of one or both houses of Congress from the Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
  
Hey!  I know the answer to that one.  As I  wrote  in early September:
  
 
Those 10% or so of voters who plan to vote Republican–even while thinking that the Democrats will do a better job–are not necessarily being so unreasonable. The Democrats control the presidency and both houses of Congress, and so it’s a completely reasonable stance to prefer them to the Republicans yet still think they’ve gone too far and need a check on their power.
 

 
But Vendatam thinks this expla</p><p>2 0.95597464 <a title="369-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Applying_quantum_probability_to_political_science.html">877 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Applying quantum probability to political science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:

<p>Introduction: What really irritates me about  this column  (by John Steele Gordon) is not how stupid it is (an article about “millionaires” that switches  within the very same paragraph  between “a nest egg of $1 million” and “a $1 million annual income” without acknowledging the difference between these concepts) or the ignorance it displays (no, it’s not true that “McCain carried the middle class” in 2008—unless by “middle class” you mean “middle class whites”).
 
No, what really ticks me off is that, when the Red State Blue State book was coming out, we pitched a “5 myths” article for the Washington Post, and they turned us down!  Perhaps the rule is:  if it’s in the Opinions section of the paper, it can’t contain any facts?  Or, to be more precise, any facts it contains must be counterbalanced by an equal number of inanities?

<p>Introduction: Rafael Huber writes: 
  
  
I conducted an experiment in which subjects where asked to estimate the probability of a certain event given a number of information (like a wheater forecaster or a stockmarket trader). These probability estimates are the dependent variable of my experiment. My goal is to model the data with a (hierarchical) Bayesian regression. A linear equation with all the presented information (quantified as log odds) defines the mu of a normal likelihood. The tau as precision is another free parameter.


y[r] ~ dnorm( mu[r] , tau[ subj[r] ] ) 
mu[r] <- b0[ subj[r] ] + b1[ subj[r] ] * x1[r] + b2[ subj[r] ] * x2[r] + b3[ subj[r] ] * x3[r]


My problem is that I do not believe that the normal is the correct probability distribution to model probability data (â&euro;Ś because the error is limited). However, until now nobody was able to tell me how I can correctly model probability data.

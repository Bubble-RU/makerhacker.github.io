<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>3 0.069781475 <a title="393-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-12-Elderpedia.html">1531 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-12-Elderpedia</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent. In other words, if one agrees with the assumptions encoded in the model, one must also agree with the conclusions entailed by these assumptions. I am not aware of any other way of doing mathematics.

Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.

<p>Introduction: Saw Argo the other day, was impressed by the way it was filmed in such a 70s style, sorta like that movie The Limey or an episode of the Rockford Files.
 
I also felt nostalgia for that relatively nonviolent era.  All those hostages and nobody was killed.  It’s a good thing the Ayatollah didn’t have some fundamentalist Shiite equivalent of John Yoo telling him to waterboard everybody.
 
At the time we were all so angry and upset about the hostage-taking, but from the perspective of our suicide-bomber era, that whole hostage episode seems so comfortingly mild.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.84895283 <a title="393-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-04-Estimating_the_effect_of_A_on_B%2C_and_also_the_effect_of_B_on_A.html">393 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-04-Estimating the effect of A on B, and also the effect of B on A</a></p>

I am working with clinicians in infectious disease and international health to study the (possible causal) relation between malnutrition and virus infection episodes (e.g., diarrhea) in babies in developing countries.


Basically the clinicians are interested in two questions: does malnutrition cause more diarrhea episodes? does diarrhea lead to malnutrition? The malnutrition status is indicated by height and weight (adjusted, HAZ and WAZ measures) observed every 3 months from birth to 1 year. They also recorded the time of each diarrhea episode during the 1 year follow-up period. They have very solid datasets for analysis.


As you can see, this is almost like a chicken and egg problem. I am a layman to causal inference. The method I use is just to do some simple regression. For example, to study the causal relation from malnutrition to diarrhea episodes, I use binary variable (diarrhea yes/no during months 0-3) as response, and use the HAZ at month 0 as covariate</p><p>3 0.78071082 <a title="393-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-20-Not_quite_getting_the_point.html">1073 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-20-Not quite getting the point</a></p>

I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Illinois. . . . My main work is in supply chain area, and empirical in nature. . . . I am working with a firm that has two separate divisions – one making cars, and the other makes trucks. Four years back, the firm made an interesting organizational change. They created a separate group of ~25 engineers, in their car division (from within their quality and production engineers). This group was focused on improving supplier quality and reported to car plant head . The truck division did not (and still does not) have such an independent “supplier improvement group”. Other than this unit in car, the organizational arrangements in the two divisions mimic each other.  There are many common suppliers to the car and truck division.


Data on quality of components coming from suppliers has been collected (for the last four years). The organizational change happened in January 2007.

<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: Charles Murray wrote a much-discussed new book, “Coming Apart:  The State of White America, 1960-2010.”
 
David Frum  quotes  Murray as writing, in an echo of now-forgotten TV personality  Tucker Carlson , that the top 5% of incomes “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it.  Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”
 
[I’ve interjected a “perhaps” into the title of this blog post to indicate that I don’t have the exact Murray quote here so I’m relying on David Frum’s interpretation.]
 
Frum does me the favor of citing Red State Blue State as evidence, and I’d like to back this up with some graphs.
 
Frum writes:
  
Say “top 5%” to Murray, and his imagination conjures up everything he dislikes: coastal liberals listening to NPR in their Lexus hybrid SUVs. He sees that image so intensely that no mere number can force him to remember that the top 5% also includes the evangelical Christian assistant coach of a state university football team. . . .

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>6 0.63712353 <a title="460-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-22-More_Pinker_Pinker_Pinker.html">1635 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-22-More Pinker Pinker Pinker</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I came across this  old blog entry  that was just hilarious–but it’s from 2005 so I think most of you haven’t seen it.
 
It’s the story of two people named Martin Voracek and Maryanne Fisher who in a published discussion criticized lowess (a justly popular nonlinear regression method).
 
Curious, I looked up “Martin Voracek” on the web and found an article in the British Medical Journal whose the title promised “trend analysis.”  I was wondering what statistical methods they used–something more sophisticated than lowess, perhaps?
 
They did have one figure, and here it is:
 
 
 
Voracek and Fisher, the critics of lowess, are fit straight lines to data to clearly nonlinear data!  It’s most obvious in their leftmost graph.  Voracek and Fisher get full credit for showing scatterplots, but hey . . . they should try lowess next time!  What’s really funny in the graph are the little dotted lines indicating inferential uncertainty in the regression lines–all under the assumption of linearity,</p><p>2 0.96392643 <a title="460-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-05-Two_exciting_movie_ideas%3A__%E2%80%9CSecond_Chance_U%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9CThe_New_Dirty_Dozen%E2%80%9D.html">1484 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-05-Two exciting movie ideas:  “Second Chance U” and “The New Dirty Dozen”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a great idea for a movie.  Actually two movies based on two variants of a similar idea.
 
It all started when I saw this story:
  
Dr. Anil Potti, the controversial cancer researcher whose work at Duke University led to lawsuits from patients, is now a medical oncologist at the Cancer Center of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
  
When asked about Dr. Potti’s controversial appointment, his new boss  said :
  
If a guy can’t get a second chance here in North Dakota, where he trained, man, you can’t get a second chance anywhere.
  
(Link from  Retraction Watch , of course.)
 
Potti’s boss is also quoted as saying, “Most, if not all, his patients have loved him.”  On the other hand, the news article reports: “The North Carolina medical board’s website lists settlements against Potti of at least $75,000.”  I guess there’s no reason you can’t love a guy and still want a juicy malpractice settlement.
 
 Second Chance U 
 
I don’t give two poops about Dr. Anil Potti.  But seeing the above s</p><p>3 0.96072066 <a title="460-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles_of_criminal_justice.html">1621 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles of criminal justice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?  From the article:  “A money-laundering indictment, or a guilt</p><p>4 0.96009755 <a title="460-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-02-%E2%80%9CIf_our_product_is_harmful_._._._we%E2%80%99ll_stop_making_it.%E2%80%9D.html">1480 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-02-“If our product is harmful . . . we’ll stop making it.”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  discussion  of the sad case of Darrell Huff, the celebrated “How to Lie with Statistics” guy who had a lucrative side career disparaging the link between smoking and cancer, I was motivated to follow John Mashey’s  recommendation  and read the book, Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition, by historian Robert Proctor.
 
My first stop upon receiving the book was the index, in particular the entry for  Rubin, Donald B.   I followed the reference to pages 440-442 and found the description of Don’s activities to be accurate, neither diminished nor overstated, to the best of my knowledge.
 
Rubin is the second-most-famous statistician to have been paid by the cigarette industry, but several other big and small names have been on the payroll at one time or another.  Here’s a partial  list .  Just including the people I know or have heard of:

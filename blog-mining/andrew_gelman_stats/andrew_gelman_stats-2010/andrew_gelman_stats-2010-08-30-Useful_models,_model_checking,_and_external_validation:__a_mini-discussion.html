<p>Introduction: In response to  my remarks  on his online book, Think Bayes, Allen Downey wrote: 
   
I [Downey] have a question about one of your comments: 
   My [Gelman's] main criticism with both books is that they talk a lot about inference but not so much about model building or model checking (recall the three steps of Bayesian data analysis). I think it’s ok for an introductory book to focus on inference, which of course is central to the data-analytic process—but I’d like them to at least mention that Bayesian ideas arise in model building and model checking as well. 

This sounds like something I agree with, and one of the things I tried to do in the book is to put modeling decisions front and center.  But the word “modeling” is used in lots of ways, so I want to see if we are talking about the same thing.


For example, in many chapters, I start with a simple model of the scenario, do some analysis, then check whether the model is good enough, and iterate.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10. Inference about μ is straightforward, as is model checking, whether based on graphs or numerical summaries such as the sample variance and skewn</p><p>4 0.21897331 <a title="244-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties_with_Bayesian_model_averaging.html">754 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties with Bayesian model averaging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In response to  this article  by Cosma Shalizi and myself on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, David Hogg writes:
  
I [Hogg] agree–even in physics and astronomy–that the models are not “True” in the God-like sense of being absolute reality (that is, I am not a realist); and I  have argued  (a philosophically very naive 
paper, but hey, I was new to all this) that for pretty fundamental reasons we could never arrive at the True (with a capital “T”) model of the Universe.  The goal of inference is to find the “best” model, where “best” might have something to do with prediction, or explanation, or message length, or (horror!) our utility.  Needless to say, most of my physics friends *are* realists, even in the face of “effective theories” as Newtonian mechanics is an effective theory of GR and GR is an effective theory of “quantum gravity” (this plays to your point, because if you think any theory is possibly an effective theory, how could you ever find Truth?).

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>3 0.91905355 <a title="244-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-05-Does_posterior_predictive_model_checking_fit_with_the_operational_subjective_approach%3F.html">320 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-05-Does posterior predictive model checking fit with the operational subjective approach?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Rohde writes:
  
 
I have been thinking a lot lately about your Bayesian model checking approach.  This is in part because I have been working on exploratory data analysis and wishing to avoid controversy and mathematical statistics we omitted model checking from our discussion.  This is something that the refereeing process picked us up on and we ultimately added a critical discussion of null-hypothesis testing to  our paper .  The exploratory technique we discussed was essentially a 2D histogram approach, but we used Polya models as a formal model for the histogram.  We are currently working on a new paper, and we are thinking through how or if we should do “confirmatory analysis” or model checking in the paper.


What I find most admirable about your statistical work is that you clearly use the Bayesian approach to do useful applied statistical analysis.  My own attempts at applied Bayesian analysis makes me greatly admire your applied successes.

<p>Introduction: In my comments on David MacKay’s 2003 book on Bayesian inference, I  wrote  that I hate all the Occam-factor stuff that MacKay talks about, and I linked to  this quote  from Radford Neal:
  
Sometimes a simple model will outperform a more complex model . . . Nevertheless, I believe that deliberately limiting the complexity of the model is not fruitful when the problem is evidently complex. Instead, if a simple model is found that outperforms some particular complex model, the appropriate response is to define a different complex model that captures whatever aspect of the problem led to the simple model performing well.
  
MacKay replied as follows:
  
When you said you disagree with me on Occam factors I think what you meant was that you agree with me on them.

Jaffe’s summary is fair enough and I only disagree in a few points: 
   
1.  Jaffe writes:
  
Subjective probability, at least the way it is actually used by practicing scientists, is a sort of “as-if” subjectivity — how would an agent reason if her beliefs were reflected in a certain set of probability distributions? This is why when I discuss probability I try to make the pedantic point that all probabilities are conditional, at least on some background prior information or context.
  
I agree, and my problem with the usual procedures used for Bayesian model comparison and Bayesian model averaging is not that these approaches are subjective but that the particular models being considered don’t make sense.  I’m thinking of the sorts of models that say the truth is either A or</p><p>6 0.90445089 <a title="244-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-11-Why_waste_time_philosophizing%3F.html">1719 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-11-Why waste time philosophizing?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96418977 <a title="244-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Useful_models%2C_model_checking%2C_and_external_validation%3A__a_mini-discussion.html">244 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Useful models, model checking, and external validation:  a mini-discussion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I sent a copy of my paper (coauthored with Cosma Shalizi) on  Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics in the social sciences  to  Richard Berk , who wrote:
  
I read your paper this morning. I think we are pretty much on the same page about all models being wrong. I like very much the way you handle this in the paper. Yes, Newton’s work is wrong, but surely useful. I also like your twist on Bayesian methods. Makes good sense to me. Perhaps most important, your paper raises some difficult issues I have been trying to think more carefully about.


1. If the goal of a model is to be useful, surely we need to explore that “useful” means. At the very least, usefulness will depend on use. So a model that is useful for forecasting may or may not be useful for causal inference.


2. Usefulness will be a matter of degree. So that for each use we will need one or more metrics to represent how useful the model is. In what looks at first to be simple example, if the use is forecasting,</p><p>3 0.96261442 <a title="244-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.

<p>Introduction: In our recent discussion of modes of publication, Joseph Wilson wrote, “The single best reform science can make right now is to decouple publication from career advancement, thereby reducing the number of publications by an order of magnitude and then move to an entirely disjointed, informal, online free-for-all communication system for research results.”
 
My first thought on this was: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. But then I got to thinking: what would it  really  mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me—I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future—but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).
 
However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should’ve just typed it all in then.

<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>6 0.95932978 <a title="244-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-09-A_tale_of_two_discussion_papers.html">1848 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-09-A tale of two discussion papers</a></p>

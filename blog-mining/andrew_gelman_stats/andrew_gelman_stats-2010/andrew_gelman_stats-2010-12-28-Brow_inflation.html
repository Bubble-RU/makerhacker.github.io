<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>3 0.086397737 <a title="489-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-In_today%E2%80%99s_economy%2C_the_rich_get_richer.html">367 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-In today’s economy, the rich get richer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture. And when we look at world-wide revenues, this film brought in more than $1.5 billion. . . . Despite what seems like a clear endorsement by the customers of this industry, the Avengers was ignored by the Oscars.  Perhaps this is just because I am an econo</p><p>5 0.071358182 <a title="489-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-18-Fiction_is_not_for_tirades%3F__Tell_that_to_Saul_Bellow%21.html">285 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-18-Fiction is not for tirades?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .


But if Freedom is middlebrow, it is so in the sacrosanct Don DeLillo tradition, which our critical establishment considers central to literature today. . . .

<p>Introduction: A  New York Times article  reports the opening of a half-mile section of bike path, recently built along the west side of Manhattan at a cost of $16M, or roughly $30 million per mile.  That’s about $5700 per linear foot.  Kinda sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?   
 
Well, $30 million per mile for about one car-lane mile is a lot, but it’s not out of line compared to other urban highway construction costs.  The Doyle Drive project in San Francisco — a freeway to replace the current old and deteriorating freeway approach to the Golden Gate Bridge — is currently under way at $1 billion for 1.6 miles…but hey, it will have six lanes each way, so that isn’t so bad, at $50 million per lane-mile.  And there are other components to the project, too, not just building the highway (there will also be bike paths, landscaping, on- and off-ramps, and so on).  All in all it seems roughly in line with the New York bike lane project.
 
Speaking of the Doyle Drive project, one expense was the cost of movin</p><p>3 0.81840658 <a title="489-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-20-plus_%C3%A7a_change%2C_plus_c%E2%80%99est_la_m%C3%AAme_chose.html">2341 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-20-plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>4 0.80012536 <a title="489-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-There_are_four_ways_to_get_fired_from_Caesars%3A__%281%29_theft%2C_%282%29_sexual_harassment%2C_%283%29_running_an_experiment_without_a_control_group%2C_and_%284%29_keeping_a_gambling_addict_away_from_the_casino.html">1619 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-There are four ways to get fired from Caesars:  (1) theft, (2) sexual harassment, (3) running an experiment without a control group, and (4) keeping a gambling addict away from the casino</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.
 
The scary part, though, was how the casino company craftily enabled her to</p><p>5 0.79508394 <a title="489-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-26-Ethnicity_and_Population_Structure_in_Personal_Naming_Networks.html">925 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-26-Ethnicity and Population Structure in Personal Naming Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks pointed me to  this recent article  by Pablo Mateos, Paul Longley, and David O’Sullivan on one of my favorite topics.
 
The authors produced a potentially cool  naming network of the city of Auckland New Zealand .  I say “potentially cool” because I have such difficulty reading the article–I speak English, statistics, and a bit of political science and economics, but this one is written in heavy sociologese–that I can’t quite be sure what they’re doing.  However, despite my (perhaps unfair) disdain for the particulars of their method, it’s probably good that they’re jumping in with this analysis.  Others can take their data (and similar datasets from elsewhere) and do better.  Ya gotta start somewhere, and the basic idea (to cluster first names that are associated with the same last names, and to cluster last names that are associated with the same first names) seems good.

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>3 0.85960853 <a title="489-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Boris_was_right.html">44 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Boris was right</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.

When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis.

</p><p>5 After reading a bunch of articles on the U-shaped relation between age and happiness–including some research that used the General Social Survey–I downloaded the GSS data (you can do it  yourself ! [sent-21, score-0.334]
</p><p>6 The idea was to start with the fascinating U-shaped pattern and then discuss what could be learned further using some basic statistical techniques of subsetting and regression. [sent-24, score-0.271]
</p><p>7 Here was my first graph, a quick summary of average happiness level (on a 0, 1, 2 scale; in total, 12% of respondents rated their happiness at 0 (the lowest level), 56% gave themselves a 1, and 32% described themselves as having the highest level on this three-point scale). [sent-26, score-1.147]
</p><p>8 In my original posted graph, I plotted the percentage of respondents of each age who had happiness levels of 1 or 2; this corrected graph plots average happiness levels. [sent-30, score-1.528]
</p><p>9 I did this by single years of age so it’s noisy–even when using decades of GSS, the sample’s not infinite–but there’s nothing like the famous U-shaped pattern! [sent-32, score-0.334]
</p><p>10 There’s a big difference between the publishedl graph, which has maxima at 20 and 85, and the my graph from GSS, which has  minima  at 20 and 85. [sent-34, score-0.275]
</p><p>11 Sometimes I could get happiness to go up with age, but then it was just a gradual rise from age 18, without the dip around age 45 or 50. [sent-39, score-1.126]
</p><p>12 ) with whom I’d collaborated on  some earlier happiness research  (in which I contributed multilevel modeling and some ideas about graphs but not much of substance regarding psychology or economics). [sent-45, score-0.61]
</p><p>13 Grazia confirmed to me that the U-shaped pattern is indeed fragile, that you have to work hard to find it, and often it shows up when people fit linear and quadratic terms, in which case everything looks like a parabola. [sent-46, score-0.328]
</p><p>14 (I’d tried regressions with age & age-squared, but it took a lot of finagling to get the coefficient for age-squared to have the “correct” sign. [sent-47, score-0.398]
</p><p>15 In summary:   I agree that happiness and life satisfaction are worth studying– of course  they’re worth studying–but, in the midst of looking for explanations for that U-shaped pattern, it might be worth looking more carefully to see what exactly is happening. [sent-53, score-0.966]
</p><p>16 )  All those explanations have to be contingent on the pattern actually existing in the population. [sent-56, score-0.259]
</p><p>17 There appear to be many different age patterns and it’s not clear to me that the U should be considered the paradigm. [sent-63, score-0.334]
</p><p>18 No big deal–it’s just a matter of terminology–but I think journalists and other outsiders can be misread if they hear about this sort of thing and start searching in the economics literature rather than in the psychology literature. [sent-67, score-0.216]
</p><p>19 In general, I think economists will have more to say than psychologists about prices, and psychologists will have more insights about emotions and happiness. [sent-68, score-0.418]
</p><p>20 I’m sure that economists can make important contributions to the study of happiness, just as psychologists can make important contributions to the study of prices, but even a magazine called “The Economist” should know the difference. [sent-69, score-0.351]

<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.

The conventional wisdom that’s developed over the past few decades — based on early research — has said parents are less happy, more depressed and have less-satisfying marriages than their childless counterparts.


But now, two new studies presented as part of the Population Association of America’s annual meeting suggest that earlier findings in several studies weren’t so clear-cut and may, in fact, be flawed. The newer analyses presented this week use analytical methods based on data from almost 130,000 adults around the globe — including more than 52,000 parents — and the conclusions aren’t so grim.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  discusses  the following  graph  that is captioned, “A study of 54 nations–ranked below–found that those with more progressive tax rates had happier citizens, on average.”
 
   
 
As Kaiser writes, “from a purely graphical perspective, the chart is well executed . . . they have 54 points, and the chart still doesn’t look too crammed . . .”  But he also points out that the graph’s implicit claims (that tax rates can explain happiness or cause more happiness) are not supported.
 
Kaiser and I are not being picky-picky-picky here.  Taken literally, the graph title says nothing about causation, but I think the phrasing implies it.  Also, from a purely descriptive perspective, the graph is somewhat at war with its caption.  The caption announces a relationship, but in the graph, the x and y variables have only a very weak correlation.  The caption says that happiness and progressive tax rates go together, but the graph uses the U.S. as a baseline, and when you move from the U.S</p><p>6 0.21162507 <a title="486-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Further_thoughts_on_happiness_and_life_satisfaction_research.html">98 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Further thoughts on happiness and life satisfaction research</a></p>

Data are from Wave II of the National Survey of Families and Households published in 1996, interviews from 1992-1994.


The division of labor:


 Core tasks include preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning house, shopping, and washing and ironing; non-core tasks include outdoor work, paying bills, auto maintenance, and driving. 


As you can see in the graph, the more of the “core” tasks a man completes, the less sex he gets.


The covariates for overall marital happiness and specific happiness with spouses’ contribution to housework did not change this relationship. The covariate for gender-traditional ideology on household labor likewise</p><p>6 0.7621724 <a title="486-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Further_thoughts_on_happiness_and_life_satisfaction_research.html">98 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Further thoughts on happiness and life satisfaction research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.
 
Now consider how</p><p>2 0.9812659 <a title="486-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>4 0.97930419 <a title="486-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-News_coverage_of_statistical_issues%E2%80%A6how_did_I_do%3F.html">514 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-News coverage of statistical issues…how did I do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice. The breadth of vN’s work is just too m</p><p>6 0.97277588 <a title="486-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-30-David_Hogg_on_statistics.html">1401 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-30-David Hogg on statistics</a></p>

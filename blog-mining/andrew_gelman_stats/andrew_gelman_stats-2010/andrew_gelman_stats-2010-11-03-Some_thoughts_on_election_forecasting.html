As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.  I</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc. [sent-1, score-0.209]
</p><p>2 If a simple model with only a couple of variables does as well, or almost as well, as a complicated effort that includes a lot more information, then, sure, that’s interesting. [sent-14, score-0.224]
</p><p>3 In the elections context, it might not change your national forecasts much but it might help in individual districts. [sent-18, score-0.494]
</p><p>4 Or, as Radford Neal put it in one of my favorite statistics quotes  of all time :    Sometimes a simple model will outperform a more complex model . [sent-19, score-0.438]
</p><p>5 Instead, if a simple model is found that outperforms some particular complex model, the appropriate response is to define a different complex model that captures whatever aspect of the problem led to the simple model performing well. [sent-23, score-0.741]
</p><p>6 Yang Hu gathered Nate’s latest probability forecasts for me, along with the election outcomes, and I checked the calibration as follows. [sent-31, score-0.74]
</p><p>7 I divided the House elections into bins:  those where Nate gave a 0-10% chance of the Republcan winning, a 10-20% chance, etc. [sent-32, score-0.304]
</p><p>8 If the forecasts are perfectly calibrated, we’d expect to see the empirical frequency of Republican wins go smoothly from 0 to 1 as the bins go from forecast probability 0 to 1. [sent-35, score-0.786]
</p><p>9 If the forecasts are  overconfident , we’d expect to see empirical frequencies closer to 0. [sent-36, score-0.617]
</p><p>10 If forecasts are  underconfident  (as Wang alleged), we’d see empirical frequencies closer to 0 and 1. [sent-38, score-0.742]
</p><p>11 Here’s what we actually found       Forecast R win prob    #cases    Empirical R win freq      0-10%               165            0. [sent-39, score-0.452]
</p><p>12 90     70-80%                10             1     80-90%                19             1    90-100%               186             1        So, yes, Nate’s forecasts do seem  over underconfident! [sent-46, score-0.28]
</p><p>13 Out of the 39 races where he gave the Republican candidate between 60% and 90% chance of winning, the Republicans snagged all 38. [sent-47, score-0.283]
</p><p>14 And if you suppose that the national swing as forecast was off by 3 percentage points in either direction, you get something close to calibration   To put it another way:  In statistics, we’re always looking for 95% confidence intervals. [sent-56, score-0.492]
</p><p>15 Midterm elections occur every four years–so, if you want an interval that is correct 19 times out of 20, you have to account for 80 years of contingencies. [sent-59, score-0.21]
</p><p>16 I don’t see any easy answer here, but it’s an issue which, as a Bayesian election modeler, I’ve been aware of for awhile. [sent-62, score-0.207]
</p><p>17 That is, I’ll either take wide Silver-style intervals and treat them as all-encompassing forecasts, or I’ll take narrow Wang-style intervals and treat them as conditional on a model. [sent-64, score-0.373]
</p><p>18 it’s simpler and more transparent, and I agree that these are virtues, but ultimately I think it’s more model-based in the sense that one has to rely strongly on a model to map Wang’s poll averages to election predictions. [sent-66, score-0.353]
</p><p>19 The Huffington Post only gave probability forecasts for 118 battleground races, which I augmented by taking all of Nate’s essentially certain races (probabilities less than . [sent-73, score-0.661]

<p>Introduction: Jeff the Productivity Sapper points me to  this insulting open letter to Nate Silver  written by pollster John Zogby.  I’ll go through bits of Zogby’s note line by line.  (Conflict of interest warning:  I have collaborated with Nate and I blog on his site).
  
Zogby writes:  Here is some advice from someone [Zogby] who has been where you [Silver] are today.
  
Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.
  
Zogby writes:  You [Nate] are hot right now – using an aggregate of other people’s work, you got 49 of 50 states right in 2008.
  
Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.

<p>Introduction: The other day we had a fun little discussion in  the comments section of the sister blog  about the appropriateness of stating forecast probabilities to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.
 
It started when Josh Tucker posted this graph from  Nate Silver :
 
   
 
My first reaction was:  this looks pretty but it’s hyper-precise.  I’m a big fan of Nate’s work, but all those little wiggles on the graph can’t really mean anything.  And what could it possibly mean to compute this probability to that level of precision?
 
In the comments, people came at me from two directions.  From one side, Jeffrey Friedman  expressed  a hard core attitude that it’s meaningless to give a probability forecast of a unique event:
  
What could it possibly mean, period, given that this election will never be repeated? . . . I know there’s a vast literature on this, but I’m still curious, as a non-statistician, what it could mean for there to be a meaningful 65% probability (as opposed to a non-quantifiab</p><p>6 0.26843494 <a title="391-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Yes%2C_checking_calibration_of_probability_forecasts_is_part_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">1610 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>5 0.85662103 <a title="391-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>6 0.83580893 <a title="391-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-Poll_aggregation_and_election_forecasting.html">1570 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-Poll aggregation and election forecasting</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve written a lot on polls and elections (“a poll is a snapshot, not a forecast,” etc., or see here for a  more technical paper  with Kari Lock) but had a few things to add in light of Sam Wang’s  recent efforts . As a biologist with a physics degree, Wang brings an outsider’s perspective to political forecasting, which can be a good thing.  (I’m a bit of an outsider to political science myself, as is my sometime collaborator Nate Silver, who’s done a lot of good work in the past few years.)
 
But there are two places where Wang misses the point, I think.
  

 
He refers to his method as a “transparent, low-assumption calculation” and compares it favorably to “fancy modeling” and “assumption-laden models.”  Assumptions are a bad thing, right?  Well, no, I don’t think so.   Bad  assumptions are a bad thing.  Good assumptions are just fine.  Similarly for fancy modeling.  I don’t see why a model should get credit for  not  including a factor that might be important.
 
Let me clarify.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Robinson writes:
  
I’m a survey researcher who mostly does political work, but I also have a strong interest in economics.  I have a question about this graph you commonly see in the economics literature. It is of a concept called the Beveridge Curve [recently in the newspaper  here ]. It is one of the more interesting concepts in labor economics, relating the vacancy rate in jobs to the unemployment rate. A  good primer is  here .


However, despite being one of the more interesting concepts in economics, the way it is displayed visually is nothing short of atrocious:


 


These graphs are nothing short of unreadable and pretty much the standard (Brad Delong has linked to this graph above and it can appear like this in publication as well). I’ve only really seen one representation of the curve that is more clear than this and it is at  this link :

<p>Introduction: Economist Stan Liebowitz has a  longstanding interest  in the difficulties of flagging published research errors.  Recently he wrote on the related topic of dishonest authorship:
  
While not about direct research fraud, I thought you might be interested in  this paper . It discusses the manner in which credit is given for economics articles, and I suspect it applies to many other areas as well. One of the conclusions is that the lack of complete proration per author will lead to excessive coauthorship, reducing overall research output by inducing the use of larger than efficient-sized teams. Under these circumstances, false authorship can be a response to the warped reward system and false authorship might improve research efficiency since it might keep actual research teams (as opposed to nominal teams) from being too large to produce research efficiently. One of the questions I rhetorically ask in the paper is whether anyone has ever been ‘punished’ for having their name included on</p><p>4 0.94981366 <a title="391-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-06-Unconvincing_defense_of_the_recent_Russian_elections%2C_and_a_problem_when_an_official_organ_of_an_academic_society_has_low_standards_for_publication.html">1103 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-06-Unconvincing defense of the recent Russian elections, and a problem when an official organ of an academic society has low standards for publication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last month we  reported  on some claims of irregularities in the recent Russian elections.  Just as a reminder, here are a couple graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
Yesterday someone pointed me to two online articles:  Mathematical proof of fraud in Russian elections unsound  and  US elections are as ‘non-normal’ as Russian elections .
 
I know nothing about Russian elections and will defer to the author and his commenters on the details.  That said, I don’t find the arguments to be at all persuasive.  The protesters show drastic differences between the patterns of votes of Putin’s party and the others, and the linked articles seem a bit too eager to debunk.
 
I wouldn’t necessarily blog on this but I was unhappy to see this material on the website of Significance, which is an official publication of the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society.
 
The quality control at this site seems low.  I clicked through the links and found  this :

<p>Introduction: Christian points me to this  interesting (but sad) analysis  by Diego Valle with an impressive series of graphs.  There are a few things I’d change (notably the R default settings which result in ridiculously over-indexed y-axes, as well as axes for homicide rates which should (but do not) go town to zero (and sometimes, bizarrely, go negative), and a lack of coherent ordering of the 32 states (including D.F.),
 
I’m no expert on Mexico (despite having coauthored a paper on Mexican politics) so I’ll leave it to others to evaluate the substantive claims in Valle’s blog.  Just looking at what he’s done, though, it seems impressive to me.

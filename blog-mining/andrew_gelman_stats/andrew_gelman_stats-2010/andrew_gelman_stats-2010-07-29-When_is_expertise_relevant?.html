<p>Introduction: A friend/colleague sent me some comments on my recent  article  with Kaiser Fung on Freakonomics.  My friend gave several reasons why he thought we were unfair to Levitt.
 
I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>4 0.38229913 <a title="170-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics%3A__What_went_wrong%3F.html">1060 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics:  What went wrong?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>5 0.35207984 <a title="170-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Herman_Chernoff_used_to_do_that_too%3B_also%2C_some_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_preferences.html">334 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Herman Chernoff used to do that too; also, some puzzlement over another’s puzzlement over another’s preferences</a></p>

Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.
 
P.S.  Levitt also writes:

2.  I think it was at best tacky and</p><p>4 0.89669877 <a title="170-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics%3A__What_went_wrong%3F.html">1060 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics:  What went wrong?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>5 0.88157135 <a title="170-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-20-Who_exactly_are_those_silly_academics_who_aren%E2%80%99t_as_smart_as_a_Vegas_bookie%3F.html">1632 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-20-Who exactly are those silly academics who aren’t as smart as a Vegas bookie?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I get suspicious when I hear unsourced claims that unnamed experts somewhere are making foolish statements.
 
For example, I recently came across this, from a Super Bowl-themed  article  from 2006 by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt:
  
As it happens, there is one betting strategy that will routinely beat a bookie, and you don’t even have to be smart to use it. One of the most undervalued N.F.L. bets is the home underdog — a team favored to lose but playing in its home stadium. If you had bet $5,000 on the home underdog in every N.F.L. game over the past two decades, you would be up about $150,000 by now (a winning rate of roughly 53 percent).
  
So far, so good.  I wonder if this pattern still holds.  But then Dubner and Levitt continue:
  
This fact has led some academics to conclude that bookmakers simply aren’t very smart. If an academic researcher can find this loophole, shouldn’t a professional bookie be able to?


But the fact is most bookies are doing just fine. So could it be</p><p>6 0.87735116 <a title="170-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-25-Freakonomics_Experiments.html">1692 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-25-Freakonomics Experiments</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>same-blog 4 0.95272523 <a title="170-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>5 0.94884616 <a title="170-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-14-GiveWell_charity_recommendations.html">1623 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-14-GiveWell charity recommendations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya.

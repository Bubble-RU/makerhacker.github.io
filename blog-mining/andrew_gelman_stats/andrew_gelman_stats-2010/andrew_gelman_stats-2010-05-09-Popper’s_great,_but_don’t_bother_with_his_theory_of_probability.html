<p>Introduction: Professor of business management Edwin Locke sent me  an article :
  
This paper argues that theory building in the social sciences, management and psychology included, should be inductive. It begins by critiquing contemporary philosophy of science, e.g., Popper’s falsifiability theory, his stress on deduction, and the hypothetico-deductive method. Next I present some history of the concept of induction in philosophy and of inductive theory building in the hard sciences (e.g., Aristotle, Bacon, Newton). This is followed by three examples of successful theory building by induction in psychology and management (Beck’s theory, Bandura’s social-cognitive theory, goal setting theory). The paper concludes with some suggested guidelines for successful theory building through induction and some new policies that journal editors might encourage.
  
Like most social scientists (but maybe not most  Bayesians ), I’m pretty much a  Popperian  myself, so I was interested to see someone taking such a</p><p>3 0.18082583 <a title="23-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-24-Empirical_implications_of_Empirical_Implications_of_Theoretical_Models.html">2263 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-24-Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bloomfield writes:
  
Most of the people in my field (accounting, which is basically applied economics and finance, leavened with psychology and organizational behavior) use ‘positive research methods’, which are typically described as coming to the data with a predefined theory, and using hypothesis testing to accept or reject the theory’s predictions.  But a substantial minority use ‘interpretive research methods’ (sometimes called qualitative methods, for those that call positive research ‘quantitative’).  No one seems entirely happy with the definition of this method, but I’ve found it useful to think of it as an attempt to see the world through the eyes of your subjects, much as Jane Goodall lived with gorillas and tried to see the world through their eyes.)


Interpretive researchers often criticize positive researchers by noting that the latter don’t make the best use of their data, because they come to the data with a predetermined theory, and only test a narrow set of h</p><p>4 0.16133095 <a title="23-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy_of_Bayes_and_non-Bayes%3A__A_dialogue_with_Deborah_Mayo.html">291 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy of Bayes and non-Bayes:  A dialogue with Deborah Mayo</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>5 0.15735453 <a title="23-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist_claims_that_modern_art_could_just_as_well_be_replaced_by_a_%E2%80%9Cpaint-throwing_chimp%E2%80%9D.html">1390 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-23-Traditionalist claims that modern art could just as well be replaced by a “paint-throwing chimp”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

<p>Introduction: Suppose you and I agree on a probability estimate…perhaps we both agree there is a 2/3 chance Spain will beat Netherlands in tomorrow’s World Cup.  In this case, we could agree on a wager: if Spain beats Netherlands, I pay you $x.  If Netherlands beats Spain, you pay me $2x.  It is easy to see that my expected loss (or win) is $0, and that the same is true for you. Either of us should be indifferent to taking this bet, and to which side of the bet we are on.  We might make this bet just to increase our interest in watching the game, but neither of us would see a money-making opportunity here. 
 
By the way, the relationship between “odds” and the event probability — a 1/3 chance of winning turning into a bet at 2:1 odds — is that if the event probability is p, then a fair bet has odds of (1/p – 1):1.  
 
More interesting, and more relevant to many real-world situations, is the case that we disagree on the probability of an event.  If we disagree on the probability, then there should be</p><p>3 0.72395718 <a title="23-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-27-Hype_about_conditional_probability_puzzles.html">54 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-27-Hype about conditional probability puzzles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jason Kottke  posts  this puzzle from Gary Foshee that reportedly impressed people at a puzzle-designers’ convention:
  
I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?


The first thing you think is “What has Tuesday got to do with it?” Well, it has everything to do with it.
  
I thought I should really figure this one out myself before reading any further, and I decided this was a good time to apply my general principle that it’s always best to solve such problems from scratch rather than trying to guess at the answer.
  

 
So I laid out all the 4 x 49 possibilities.  The 4 is bb, bg, gb, gg, and the 49 are all possible pairs of days of the week.  Then I ruled out all the possibilities that were inconsistent with the data:  this leaves the following:
 
bb with all pairs of days that include a Tuesday.  That’s 13 possibilities (Mon/Tues, Tues/Tues, Wed/Tues, …, Tues/Mon, …, Sun/Tues, remembering not to count Tues/Tues twice).

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Mike Betancourt and I wrote a discussion for the article, Can quantum probability provide a new direction for cognitive modeling?, by Emmanuel Pothos and Jerome Busemeyer, in Behavioral and Brain Sciences.  We didn’t say much, but it was a milestone for me because, with this article, BBS became the 100th journal I’d published in.
 
Anyway, the full article with its 34 discussions just appeared  in the journal .   Here  it is.
 
What surprised me, in reading the full discussion, was how supportive the commentary was.  Given the topic of Pothos and Busemeyer’s article, I was expecting the discussions to range from gentle mockery to outright abuse.  The discussion that Mike and I wrote was moderately encouraging, and I was expecting this to fall on the extreme positive end of the spectrum.
 
Actually, though, most of the discussions were positive, and only a couple were purely negative (those would be “Quantum models of cognition as Orwellian newspeak” by Michael Lee a</p><p>5 0.6886155 <a title="23-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-25-Classical_probability_does_not_apply_to_quantum_systems_%28causal_inference_edition%29.html">2037 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-25-Classical probability does not apply to quantum systems (causal inference edition)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: James Robins, Tyler VanderWeele, and Richard Gill  write :
  
Neyman introduced a formal mathematical theory of counterfactual causation that now has become standard language in many quantitative disciplines, but not in physics. We use results on causal interaction and interference between treatments (derived under the Neyman theory) to give a simple new proof of a well-known result in quantum physics, namely, Bellís inequality.


Now the predictions of quantum mechanics and the results of experiment both violate Bell’s inequality. In the remainder of the talk, we review the implications for a counterfactual theory of causation. Assuming with Einstein that faster than light (supraluminal) communication is not possible, one can view the Neyman theory of counterfactuals as falsified by experiment. . . .


Is it safe for a quantitative discipline to rely on a counterfactual approach to causation, when our best confirmed physical theory falsifies their existence?

Any chance you could do a post explaining Popper’s propensity theory of probability?  I have never understood it.
  
My reply:  I’m a big fan of Popper (search this blog for details), especially as interpreted by Lakatos, but as far as I can tell, Popper’s theory of probability is hopeless.  We’ve made a lot of progress on probability in the past 75 years, and I don’t see any real need to go back to the bad old days.</p><p>2 0.99986678 <a title="23-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Jelte_Wicherts_lays_down_the_stats_on_IQ.html">6 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Jelte Wicherts lays down the stats on IQ</a></p>

My lab recently got some money to get a high-end machine. We’re mostly going to do MCMC stuff, is there anything specialized that I should keep in mind, or would any computing platform do the job?

</p><p>8 Anyway, one of the times I gave the talk, a new idea came out:  One thing that people like about infovis is the puzzle-solving aspect. [sent-10, score-0.441]
</p><p>9 For example, when someone sees that horrible map with the plane crashes (see page 23 of  the presentation ), there is a mini-joy of discovery at noticing–Hey, that’s Russia! [sent-11, score-0.4]
</p><p>10 From our perspective as statisticians, it’s a cheap thrill:  the reader is wasting brainpower to discover the obvious. [sent-14, score-0.346]

</p><p>13 I’m not saying that statisticians are  better  than infovis people, just that we strive for different effects. [sent-19, score-0.426]

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.19026245 <a title="492-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>4 0.17475417 <a title="492-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-02-Back_when_50_miles_was_a_long_way.html">1649 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-02-Back when 50 miles was a long way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Michael Graham Richard has  posted some great maps  from the 1932 Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States; the maps show how long it took to get to various places in the U.S. from New York City in 1800, 1830, 1857, and 1930. (I wonder if the atlas has one from around 1900 as well, that didn’t make it into the article? I’d like to see it, too, if it exists.)  Worth a look.

<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>6 0.16357058 <a title="492-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-22-%E2%80%9CInformation_visualization%E2%80%9D_vs._%E2%80%9CStatistical_graphics%E2%80%9D.html">816 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-22-“Information visualization” vs. “Statistical graphics”</a></p>

And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized. But if we start looking at individuals, we’ll s</p><p>3 0.8076629 <a title="492-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-09-The_quest_for_the_holy_graph.html">794 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-09-The quest for the holy graph</a></p>

I was just going through the latest draft of  your paper with Anthony Unwin . I heard part of it at  the talk  you gave (remotely) here at UMich.  I’m curious about your discussion of the  Baby Name Voyager .


The tool in itself is simple, attractive, and useful.  No argument from me there.  It’s an awesome demonstration of how subtle interactions can be very helpful (click and it zooms, type and it filters… falls perfectly into the Shneiderman visualization mantra). It satisfies a very common use case: finding appropriate names for children.


That said, I can’t help but feeling that what you are really excited about is  the very static analysis on last letters  (you spend most of your time on this).  This analysis, incidentally, is not possible to infer from the interactive application (which doesn’t support this type of filtering and pivoting).  In a sense, the two visualizations don’t have anything to do with each other (other than a shared context/dataset).</p><p>4 0.79831231 <a title="492-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-11-Data_Visualization_vs._Statistical_Graphics.html">407 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-11-Data Visualization vs. Statistical Graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.
 
It would take very little effort to adapt this graph-laden a</p><p>5 0.77134067 <a title="492-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful_Line_Charts.html">1125 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful Line Charts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I stumbled across a chart that’s in my opinion the best way to express a comparison of quantities through time:
 
   
 
It  compares  the new PC companies, such as Apple, to traditional PC companies like IBM and Compaq, but on the same scale. If you’d like to see how iPads and other novelties compare, see  here . I’ve tried to use the same type of visualization in my old work on  legal data visualization .

While the first figure is pure perfection, Tufte purists might find the second one too colorful. But to a busy person, color helps tell things apart: when I know that pink means interest, it takes a fraction of the second to assess the situation. We live in 2012, not in 1712 to have to think black and white.

<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this?

I wonder what was in the syllabus?  If anyone has a copy, feel free to send to me and I will post it here.
 
My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.
  
Talk about obedience to authority!

<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>4 0.92341805 <a title="492-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian_analogue_to_stepwise_regression%3F.html">1535 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian analogue to stepwise regression?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>5 0.91904479 <a title="492-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>6 0.91859943 <a title="492-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-23-In_which_I_disagree_with_John_Maynard_Keynes.html">1775 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-23-In which I disagree with John Maynard Keynes</a></p>

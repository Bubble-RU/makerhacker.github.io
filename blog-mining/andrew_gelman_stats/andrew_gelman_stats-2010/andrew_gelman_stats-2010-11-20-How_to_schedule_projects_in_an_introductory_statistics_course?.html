<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

<p>Introduction: Xian, Judith, and I read this line in a book by statistician Murray Aitkin in which he considered the following hypothetical example:
  
A survey of 100 individuals expressing support (Yes/No) for the president, before and after a presidential address . . . The question of interest is whether there has been a change in support between the surveys . . . We want to assess the evidence for the hypothesis of equality H1 against the alternative hypothesis H2 of a change.
  
Here is  our response :
  
Based on our experience in public opinion research, this is not a real question. Support for any political position is always changing. The real question is how much the support has changed, or perhaps how this change is distributed across the population.


A defender of Aitkin (and of classical hypothesis testing) might respond at this point that, yes, everybody knows that changes are never exactly zero and that we should take a more “grown-up” view of the null hypothesis, not that the change</p><p>4 0.17294835 <a title="423-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-24-Empirical_implications_of_Empirical_Implications_of_Theoretical_Models.html">2263 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-24-Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models</a></p>

<p>Introduction: April Galyardt writes:
  
I’m teaching my first graduate class this semester. It’s intro stats for graduate students in the college of education. Most of the students are first year PhD students. Though, there are a number of master’s students who are primarily in-service teachers. The difficulties with teaching an undergraduate intro stats course are still present, in that mathematical preparation and phobia vary widely across the class.


I’ve been enjoying the class and the students, but I’d like your take on an issue I’ve been thinking about. How do I balance teaching the standard methods, like hypothesis testing, that these future researchers have to know because they are so standard, with discussing the problems with those methods (e.g.  p-value as a measure of sample size , and  the decline effect , not to mention multiple testing and other common mistakes). It feels a bit like saying “Ok here’s what everybody does, but really it’s broken” and then there’s not enough time to tal</p><p>6 0.16813323 <a title="423-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-23-Discussion_on_preregistration_of_research_studies.html">2183 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-23-Discussion on preregistration of research studies</a></p>

Despite the myriad rules and procedures of science, some research findings are pure flukes. Perhaps you’re testing a new drug, and by chance alone, a large number of people spontaneously get better. The better your study is conducted, the lower the chance that your result was a fluke – but still, there is always a certain probability that it was.


Statistical significance testing gives you an idea of what this probability is.


In science we’re always testing hypotheses. We never conduct a study to ‘see what happens’, because there’s always at least one way to make any useless set of data look important.

<p>Introduction: John Haubrick writes:
  
Next semester I want to center my statistics class around independent projects that they will present at the end of the semester.   My question is, by centering around a project and teaching for the different parts that they need at the time, should topics such as hypothesis testing be moved toward the beginning of the course?  Or should I only discuss setting up a research hypothesis and discuss the actual testing later after they have the data?
  
My reply:
 
Iâ&euro;&trade;m not sure.  There always is a difficulty of what can be covered in a project.  My quick thought is that a project will perhaps work better if it is focused on data collection or exploratory data analysis rather than on estimation and hypothesis testing, which are topics that get covered pretty well in the course as a whole.</p><p>2 0.98006952 <a title="423-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-The_Three_Golden_Rules_for_Successful_Scientific_Research.html">166 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>3 0.97938812 <a title="423-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-02-%E2%80%9CThe_sky_is_the_limit%E2%80%9D_isn%E2%80%99t_such_a_good_thing.html">835 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-02-“The sky is the limit” isn’t such a good thing</a></p>

I’ve long been glad that when I went to college in the 80s, I was at MIT rather than Harvard. Either place I would’ve taken hard classes and learned a lot, but one advantage of MIT was that we had no sense–no sense at all–that we could make big bucks. We had no sense of making moderately big bucks as lawyers, no sense of making big bucks working on Wall Street, and no sense of making really big bucks by starting a business. I mean, sure, we knew about lawyers (but we didn’t know that a lawyer with technical skills would be a killer combination), we knew about Wall Street (but we had no idea what they did, other than shout pork belly prices across a big room), and we knew about tech startups (but we had no idea that they were anything to us beyond a source of jobs for engineers).

<p>Introduction: I’ll answer the above question after first sharing some background and history on the the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, which appeared at the end of our  rejoinder  to the discussion to which I  linked  the other day:
  
When we were beginning our statistical educations, the word ‘Bayesian’ conveyed membership in an obscure cult. Statisticians who were outside the charmed circle could ignore the Bayesian subfield, while Bayesians themselves tended to be either apologetic or brazenly defiant. These two extremes manifested themselves in ever more elaborate proposals for non-informative priors, on the one hand, and declarations of the purity of subjective probability, on the other.


Much has changed in the past 30 years. ‘Bayesian’ is now often used in casual scientific parlance as a synonym for ‘rational’, the anti-Bayesians have mostly disappeared, and non-Bayesian statisticians feel the need to keep up with developments in Bayesian modelling and computation. Bayesians themselves</p><p>5 0.97606301 <a title="423-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Continuous_variables_in_Bayesian_networks.html">1228 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Continuous variables in Bayesian networks</a></p>

I’m a former undergrad machine learning student and a current software engineer with a Bayesian hobby. Today my two worlds collided. I ask for some enlightenment.


On your blog you’ve repeatedly advocated continuous distributions with Bayesian models. Today I read  this article  by Ricky Ho, who writes:

 
The strength of Bayesian network is it is highly scalable and can learn incrementally because all we do is to count the observed variables and update the probability distribution table. Similar to Neural Network, Bayesian network expects all data to be binary, categorical variable will need to be transformed into multiple binary variable as described above. Numeric variable is generally not a good fit for Bayesian network.
 

The last sentence seems to be at odds with what you’ve said. Sadly, I don’t have enough expertise to say which view of the world is correct.

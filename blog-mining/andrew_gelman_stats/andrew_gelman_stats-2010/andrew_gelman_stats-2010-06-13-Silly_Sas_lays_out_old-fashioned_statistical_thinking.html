<p>Introduction: We had a recent  discussion  about statistics packages where people talked about the structure and capabilities of different computer languages.  One thing I wanted to add to this discussion is some sociology.  To me, a statistics package is not just its code, it’s also its community, it’s what people do with it.
 
R, for example, is nothing special for graphics (again, I think in retrospect my graphs would be better if I’d been making them in Fortran all these years); what makes R graphics work so well is that there’s a clear path from the numbers to the graphs, there’s a tradition in R of postprocessing.
 
In comparison, consider Sas.  I’ve never directly used Sas but whenever I’ve seen it used, whether by people working for me or with me or just people down the hall who left Sas output sitting in the printer, in all these cases there’s no postprocessing.  It doesn’t look interactive at all.  The user runs some procedure and then there are pages and pages and pages of output.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>4 0.14558588 <a title="83-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-02-Classification_error.html">1745 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-02-Classification error</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The journal Rationality, Markets and Morals has finally posted all the articles in their  special issue  on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics.
 
 My contribution  is called Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.  I’ll also post my reactions to the other articles.  I wrote these notes a few weeks ago and could post them all at once, but I think it will be easier if I post my reactions to each article separately.
 
  
 
To start with my best material, here’s my reaction to David Cox and Deborah Mayo, “A Statistical Scientist Meets a Philosopher of Science.”  I recommend you read all the way through my long note below; there’s good stuff throughout:
 
1.  Cox:  “[Philosophy] forces us to say what it is that we really want to know when we analyze a situation statistically.”
 
This reminds me of a standard question that Don Rubin (who, unlike me, has little use for philosophy in his research) asks in virtually any situation:  “What would you do if you had all the data?”  For</p><p>6 0.12188485 <a title="83-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-31-Using_factor_analysis_or_principal_components_analysis_or_measurement-error_models_for_biological_measurements_in_archaeology%3F.html">1094 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-31-Using factor analysis or principal components analysis or measurement-error models for biological measurements in archaeology?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Greenhouse writes:
  
I saw your recent paper on Feller [see  here  and, for a more fanciful theory,  here ].  Looks like it was fun to write.  I recently wrote  a paper  that asks an orthogonal question to yours.  Why during the 1950-1960′s did Jerry Cornfield become a Bayesian?   It appeared in Statistics in Medicine –  “On becoming a Bayesian: Early correspondences between J. Cornfield and L. J. Savage.”
  
In his paper, Greenhouse writes:
  
Jerome Cornfield was arguably the leading proponent for the use of Bayesian methods in biostatistics during the 1960s. Prior to 1963, however, Cornfield had no publications in the area of Bayesian statistics. At a time when frequentist methods were the dominant influence on statistical practice, Cornfield went against the mainstream and embraced Bayes. . . . Cornfield’s interest in Bayesian methods began prior to 1961 and that the clarity of his Bayesian outlook began to take shape following Birnbaum’s ASA paper on the likelihood prin- cip</p><p>3 0.80690283 <a title="83-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-29-Ya_don%E2%80%99t_know_Bayes%2C_Jack.html">117 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-29-Ya don’t know Bayes, Jack</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.  It’s just that he’s fighting against a bu</p><p>4 0.80621517 <a title="83-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-03-Philosophy_of_Bayesian_statistics%3A__my_reactions_to_Senn.html">1151 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-03-Philosophy of Bayesian statistics:  my reactions to Senn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Stephen Senn, “You May Believe You Are a Bayesian But You Are Probably Wrong”:
 
I agree with Senn’s comments on the impossibility of the de Finetti subjective Bayesian approach.  As I wrote in 2008, if you could really construct a subjective prior you believe in, why not just look at the data and write down your subjective posterior.  The immense practical difficulties with  any  serious system of inference render it absurd to think that it would be possible to just write down a probability distribution to represent uncertainty.  I wish, however, that Senn would recognize  my  Bayesian approach (which is also that of John Carlin, Hal Stern, Don Rubin, and, I believe, others).  De Finetti is no longer around, but we are!
 
I have to admit that my own Bayesian views and practices have changed.  In particular, I resonate wit</p><p>5 0.80568415 <a title="83-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-04-Generalized_Method_of_Moments%2C_whatever_that_is.html">449 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-04-Generalized Method of Moments, whatever that is</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xuequn Hu writes:
  
I am an econ doctoral student, trying to do some empirical work using Bayesian methods.  Recently I read a paper(and its discussion) that pitches Bayesian methods against GMM (Generalized Method of Moments), which is quite popular in econometrics for frequentists. I am wondering if you can, here or on your blog, give some insights about these two methods, from the perspective of a Bayesian statistician. I know GMM does not conform to likelihood principle, but Bayesian are often charged with strong distribution assumptions.  
  
I can’t actually help on this, since I don’t know what GMM is.  My guess is that, like other methods that don’t explicitly use prior estimation, this method will work well if sufficient information is included as data.  Which would imply a hierarchical structure.</p><p>6 0.79820853 <a title="83-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-More_on_Bayesian_deduction-induction.html">114 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-More on Bayesian deduction-induction</a></p>

We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute reports:
  
Goldman Sachs’ latest forecast (and they’ve been pretty accurate so far) is that unemployment will rise to 9.9% by early 2011 and trend down to 9.7% for the last quarter of 2011. Obviously, this is a simply awful scenario but it seems one that is being accepted. That is, we seem to be in the process of accepting the unacceptable. Note that this scenario probably assumes the passage of the limited efforts now being considered in Congress.
  
One might be surprised that Obama and congressional Democrats are not doing more to try to bring unemployment down.  On the other hand, just to speak in generalities (not knowing any of the people involved), I would think that Obama would be much much more worried about the economy doing well in 2010 and then crashing in 2012.  A crappy economy through 2011 and then improvement in 2012–that would be his ideal, no?  Not that he would have the ability to time this sort of thing.

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

<p>Introduction: People keep telling me that Sas isn’t as bad as everybody says, but then I see (from  Christian Robert ) this listing from the Sas website of “disadvantages in using Bayesian analysis”:
  
There is no correct way to choose a prior. Bayesian inferences require skills to translate prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior. If you do not proceed with caution, you can generate misleading results. . . . From a practical point of view, it might sometimes be difficult to convince subject matter experts who do not agree with the validity of the chosen prior.
  
That is so tacky! As if least squares, logistic regressions, Cox models, and all those other likelihoods mentioned in the Sas documentation are so automatically convincing to subject matter experts.
 
P.S.  For some more serious objections to Bayesian statistics, see  here  and  here .

</p><p>10 If I were a Member of Congress and had the choice between (A) controlling national tides, and (B) controlling my state’s redistricting, then I’m going to choose B every time — and that’s in O’Neill’s column. [sent-11, score-0.326]
</p><p>11 Here’s my response:   Yes, the Tip O’Neills of the world need local skills to win the primary election that gets them into their safe seat, and they need backroom political skills in the state legislature to keep their safe seats every ten years. [sent-12, score-1.251]
</p><p>12 But I don’t think this is what people are talking about when they say “all politics is local. [sent-13, score-0.393]
</p><p>13 ”  It usually is meant to refer to constituency service. [sent-14, score-0.25]
</p><p>14 All the constituency service in the world won’t stop you from getting gerrymandered. [sent-15, score-0.25]

</p><p>18 So, sure, the evidence is that some politicians are more popular than others (even after controlling for district) and, sure, some of that has gotta be constituency service. [sent-20, score-0.474]
</p><p>19 Again, I agree with Bernstein that if a congressman wants to stay around, he should remain on good terms with the powers in his state, but I don’t see this as the “local politics” that people are always talking about. [sent-23, score-0.339]

<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>3 0.45623118 <a title="478-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-08-More_evidence_of_growing_nationalization_of_congressional_elections.html">508 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-08-More evidence of growing nationalization of congressional elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day  I posted some evidence  that, however things used to be, congressional elections are increasingly nationalized, and it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s slogan, “all politics is local.”  (The discussion started with a  remark  by O.G. blogger Mickey Kaus; I also explain why I disagree with Jonathan Bernstein’s  disagreement  with me.)

<p>Introduction: Jas sends along  this paper  (with Devin Caughey), entitled Regression-Discontinuity Designs and Popular Elections: Implications of Pro-Incumbent Bias in Close U.S. House Races, and writes:
  
The paper shows that regression discontinuity does not work for US House elections. Close House elections are anything but random. It isn’t election recounts or something like that (we collect recount data to show that it isn’t).  We have collected much new data to try to hunt down what is going on (e.g., campaign finance data, CQ pre-election forecasts, correct many errors in the Lee dataset). The substantive implications are interesting.  We also have a section that compares in details Gelman and King versus the Lee estimand and estimator.
  
I had a few comments:
  

 
David Lee is not estimating the effect of incumbency; he’s estimating the effect of the incumbent party, which is a completely different thing.  The regression discontinuity design is completely inappropriate for estimating the</p><p>5 0.13138834 <a title="478-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-31-%E2%80%9Cthe_forces_of_native_stupidity_reinforced_by_that_blind_hostility_to_criticism%2C_reform%2C_new_ideas_and_superior_ability_which_is_human_as_well_as_academic_nature%E2%80%9D.html">1148 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-31-“the forces of native stupidity reinforced by that blind hostility to criticism, reform, new ideas and superior ability which is human as well as academic nature”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Q. D. Leavis wrote:
  
The answer does seem to be that the academic world, like other worlds, is run by the politicians, and sensitively scrupulous people tend to leave politics to other people, while people with genuine work to do certainly have no time as well as no taste for committee-rigging and the associated techniques.  And then of course there are the forces of native stupidity reinforced by that blind hostility to criticism, reform, new ideas and superior ability which is human as well as academic nature.
  
Not that I’ve ever read anything by Mrs. Leavis (or, as the Brits used to write, Mrs Leavis).  The above quote is one of the epigraphs to a book by Richard Kostelanetz.  Whom I’ve never heard of, except in a footnote in John Rodden’s classic Orwell study, The Politics of Literary Reputation.
 
I’ll have more to say about Orwell in another post, but for now let me return to the above Leavis quote, to which I have three reactions:

<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>5 0.73228544 <a title="478-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-11-Separating_national_and_state_swings_in_voting_and_public_opinion%2C_or%2C_How_I_avoided_blogorific_embarrassment%3A__An_agony_in_four_acts.html">200 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-11-Separating national and state swings in voting and public opinion, or, How I avoided blogorific embarrassment:  An agony in four acts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I dodged a bullet the other day, blogorifically speaking.  This is a (moderately) long story but there’s a payoff at the end for those of you who are interested in forecasting or understanding voting and public opinion at the state level.
 
 Act 1 
 
It started when Jeff Lax made  this comment  on his recent blog entry:
  
 Nebraska Is All That Counts for a Party-Bucking Nelson 


Dem Senator On Blowback From His Opposition To Kagan: ‘Are They From Nebraska? Then I Don’t Care’


Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…
  
I conferred with Jeff and then wrote the following entry for fivethirtyeight.com.  There was a backlog of posts at 538 at the time, so I set it on delay to appear the following morning.  
 
Here’s my post (which I ended up deleting before it ever appeared):

<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  wrote  that Mickey Kaus was right to point out that it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.” As Kaus points out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.  The slogan is particularly silly for Tip O’Neill himself.  Sure, O’Neill had to have a firm grip on local politics to get his safe seat in the first place, but after that it was smooth sailing.
 
Jonathan Bernstein  disagrees , writing:
  
 
Yes, but: don’t most Members of the House have ironclad partisan districts?  And isn’t the most important single thing they can do to protect themselves involve having pull in state politics to avoid being gerrymandered?  That is “all politics is local,” no? 


There’s also a fair amount they can do to stay on the good side of their local party, thus avoiding a primary fight.  And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>2 0.95542598 <a title="478-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>3 0.95048118 <a title="478-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-05-The_statistics_software_signal.html">1655 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-05-The statistics software signal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>4 0.94384551 <a title="478-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-Defining_ourselves_arbitrarily.html">1411 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-Defining ourselves arbitrarily</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.
 
Robin Hanson happens not to use much slang and he uses this trait to define himself, not quite to stand out in the crowd but to put himself on one end of a scale.

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  writes :
  
I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years.

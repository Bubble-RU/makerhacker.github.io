<p>Introduction: People keep asking me what I think of Nate’s book, and I keep replying that, as a blogger, I’m spoiled.  I’m so used to getting books for free that I wouldn’t go out and buy a book just for the purpose of reviewing it.  (That reminds me that I should post reviews of some of those books I’ve received in the mail over the past few months.)
 
I have, however, encountered a couple of reviews of The Signal and the Noise so I thought I’d pass them on to you.  Both these reviews are by statisticians / data scientists who work here in NYC in the non-academic “real world” so in that sense they are perhaps better situated than me to review the book (also, they have not collaborated with Nate so they have no conflict of interest).
 
Kaiser Fung gives a  positive review :
  
It is in the subtitle—“why so many predictions fail – but some don’t”—that one learns the core philosophy of Silver: he is most concerned with the honest evaluation of the performance of predictive models.

Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.
 
The question then arises:  why do descriptions of data science focus so</p><p>5 0.11657184 <a title="87-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-14-NYC_1950.html">661 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-14-NYC 1950</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Coming back from Chicago we flew right over Manhattan.  Very impressive as always, to see all those buildings so densely packed.  But think of how impressive it must have seemed in 1950!  The world had a lot less of everything back in 1950 (well, we had more oil in the ground, but that’s about it), so Manhattan must have just seemed amazing.  I can see how American leaders of that period could’ve been pretty smug.  Our #1 city was leading the world by so much, it was decades ahead of its time, still impressive even now after 60 years of decay.</p><p>6 0.1126826 <a title="87-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-24-Parables_vs._stories.html">2184 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-24-Parables vs. stories</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The other day  I posted some evidence  that, however things used to be, congressional elections are increasingly nationalized, and it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s slogan, “all politics is local.”  (The discussion started with a  remark  by O.G. blogger Mickey Kaus; I also explain why I disagree with Jonathan Bernstein’s  disagreement  with me.)
 
Alan Abramowitz writes in with an analysis of National Election Study from a recent paper of his:

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>5 0.71218771 <a title="87-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-21-The_Commissar_for_Traffic_presents_the_latest_Five-Year_Plan.html">2181 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-21-The Commissar for Traffic presents the latest Five-Year Plan</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do Paul Samuelson and the U.S. Department of Transportation have in common?
 
Phil Price points us to  this  news article by Clark Williams-Derry:
  
As the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin points out, the US Department of Transportation has been making the virtually identical vehicle travel forecasts for well over a decade. All of those forecasts project rapid and incessant growth in vehicle travel for as far as the eye can see. Meanwhile, actual traffic volumes have flattened out, and may actually be falling.


 


Each of the rising colored lines represents a forecast from a different year.  The black line represents actual traffic trends on US roads—which never rose as quickly as the forecasters had predicted, and actually started a modest decline in 2007.
  
I’d like to see a label on the y-axis, and I’d recommend labeling the x-axis at 5-year intervals rather than every year, but the point seems pretty clear.

<p>Introduction: Jeff, Justin, and I  write :
  
Gay marriage is not going away as a highly emotional, contested issue. Proposition 8, the California ballot measure that bans same-sex marriage, has seen to that, as it winds its way through the federal courts.  But perhaps the public has reached a turning point.

<p>Introduction: Frank Wood and Nick Bartlett  write :
  
Deplump works the same as all probabilistic lossless compressors. A datastream is fed one observation at a time into a predictor which emits both the data stream and predictions about what the next observation in the stream should be for every observation. An encoder takes this output and produces a compressed stream which can be piped over a network or to a file. A receiver then takes this stream and decompresses it by doing everything in reverse. In order to ensure that the decoder has the same information available to it that the encoder had when compressing the stream, the decoded datastream is both emitted and directed to another predictor. This second predictor’s job is to produce exactly the same predictions as the initial predictor so that the decoder has the same information at every step of the process as the encoder did.


The difference between probabilistic lossless compressors is in the prediction engine, encoding and decoding bein</p><p>4 0.9144392 <a title="87-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-07-Hangman_tips.html">1250 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-07-Hangman tips</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

<p>Introduction: This one  was so beautiful I just had to repost it:
 
From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.

<p>Introduction: Jeff sent me an email with the above title and a  link  to a press release, “Nut consumption reduces risk of death,” which begins:
  
According to the largest study of its kind, people who ate a daily handful of nuts were 20 percent less likely to die from any cause over a 30-year period than those who didn’t consume nuts . . . Their report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, contains further good news: The regular nut-eaters were found to be more slender than those who didn’t eat nuts, a finding that should alleviate fears that eating a lot of nuts will lead to overweight. . . .


For the new research, the scientists were able to tap databases from two well-known, ongoing observational studies that collect data on diet and other lifestyle factors and various health outcomes. The Nurses’ Health Study provided data on 76,464 women between 1980 and 2010, and the Health Professionals’ Follow-Up Study yielded data on 42,498 men from 1986 to 2010. . . .

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.  So we</p><p>4 0.58227688 <a title="306-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-14-How_do_you_think_about_the_values_in_a_confidence_interval%3F.html">1672 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-14-How do you think about the values in a confidence interval?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philip Jones writes:
  
As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.


Please note I am not referring to credible intervals, but rather to the common medical journal reporting standard of confidence intervals.

<p>Introduction: That’s ok , Krugman earlier  slammed  Galbraith.  (I wonder if Krugman is as big a fan of “tough choices” now as he was  in 1996 .)  Given Krugman’s politicization in recent years, I’m surprised he’s so dismissive of the political (rather than technical-economic) nature of Hayek’s influence.  (I don’t know if he’s changed his views on Galbraith in recent years.)

I’m dealing with high dimensional (40-50 parameters) hierarchical bayesian model applied to nonlinear Poisson regression problem.


Now I’m using an adaptive version for the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm with a truncated drift (Yves F. Atchade, 2003) to obtain samples from posterior.


But this algorithm is not very efficient in my case, it needs several millions iterations as burn-in period. And simulation takes quite a long time, since algorithm has to work with 40×40 matrices.


Maybe you know another MCMC algorithm which could take not so many burn-in samples and would be able to deal with nonlinear regression? In non-hierarchical nonlinear regression model adaptive metropolis algorithm is enough, but in hierarchical case I could use something more effective.
  
My reply:
 
Try fitting the model in Stan.  If that doesn’t work, let me know.</p><p>3 0.95273668 <a title="306-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-19-Tempering_and_modes.html">1018 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-19-Tempering and modes</a></p>

Tempering should always be done in the spirit of *searching* for important modes of the distribution.  If we assume that we know where they are, then there is no point to tempering. Now, tempering is actually a *bad* way of searching for important modes, it just happens to be easy to program.  As always, my [Gustavo's] prescription is to FIRST find the important modes (as a pre-processing step); THEN sample from each mode independently; and FINALLY weight the samples appropriately, based on the estimated probability mass of each mode, though things might get messy if you end 
up jumping between modes.
  
My reply:
 
1.  Parallel tempering has always seemed like a great idea, but I have to admit that the only time I tried it (with Matt2 on the tree-ring example), it didn’t work for us.
 
2.  You say you’d rather sample from the modes and then average over them.  But that won’t work if if you have a zillion modes.  Also, if you know where the modes are, the quickest w</p><p>same-blog 4 0.95272893 <a title="306-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-Statistics_and_the_end_of_time.html">306 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-Statistics and the end of time</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>6 0.93775219 <a title="306-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-26-How_to_understand_coefficients_that_reverse_sign_when_you_start_controlling_for_things%3F.html">1870 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-26-How to understand coefficients that reverse sign when you start controlling for things?</a></p>

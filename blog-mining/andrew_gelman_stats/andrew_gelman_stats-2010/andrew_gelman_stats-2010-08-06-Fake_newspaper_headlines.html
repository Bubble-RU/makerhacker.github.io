<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog will know that I’m always on the lookout for new items for the  lexicon .  It’s been a good month on that front.  In addition to the Garden of Forking Paths, I’ve encountered two entirely new (to me) fallacies.
 
The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: Philip Jones writes:
  
As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.


Please note I am not referring to credible intervals, but rather to the common medical journal reporting standard of confidence intervals.

<p>Introduction: I remember in 4th grade or so, the teacher would give us a list of vocabulary words each week and we’d have to show we learned them by using each in a sentence.  We quickly got bored and decided to do the assignment by writing a single sentence using all ten words.  (Which the teacher hated, of course.)
 
The above headline is in that spirit, combining  blog   posts  rather than vocabulary words.
 
But that only uses two of the entries.  To really do the job, I’d need to throw in bivariate associations, ecological fallacies, high-dimensional feature selection, statistical significance, the suddenly unpopular name Hilary, snotty reviewers, the contagion of obesity, and milk-related spam.
 
Or we could bring in some of the all-time favorites, such as Bayesians, economists, Finland, beautiful parents and their daughters, goofy graphics, red and blue states, essentialism in children’s reasoning, chess running, and zombies.

<p>Introduction: There’s something satisfying about seeing the same error being made by commentators on the left and the right.  In this case, we’re talking about  the one-way street fallacy , which is the implicit assumption of unidirectionality in a setting that actually has underlying symmetry.
 
1.  A month or so ago we  reported  on an op-ed by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who was discussing recent research exemplified by the headline, “Study: Having daughters makes parents more likely to be Republican.”  Douthat wrote all about different effects of having girls, without realizing that the study was comparing parents of girls to parents of boys.  He just as well could have talked about the effects of having sons, and how that is associated with voting for Democrats (according to the study).  But he did not do so; he was implicitly considering boy children to be the default.

<p>Introduction: I used  this convenient site  to create some images for a talk I’m preparing.  (The competing headlines:  “Beautiful parents have more daughters” vs. “No compelling evidence that beautiful parents are more or less likely to have daughters.”  The latter gets cut off at “No compelling evidence that,” which actually works pretty well to demonstrate the sort of dull headline that would result if newspapers were to publish null results.)</p><p>2 0.7533406 <a title="188-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-02-These_people_totally_don%E2%80%99t_know_what_Chance_magazine_is_all_about.html">1192 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-02-These people totally don’t know what Chance magazine is all about</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).


I would love for you (and anyone you’d like to</p><p>3 0.73452711 <a title="188-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

April 27, 4:10-5 p.m., 1011 Evans Hall
 
I will deliver  one  of the following three talks: 
1.  Of beauty, sex, and power: Statistical challenges in estimating small effects  
2.  Why we (usually) don’t worry about multiple comparisons  
3.  Parameterization and Bayesian modeling  
Whoever shows up on time to the seminar gets to vote, and I’ll give the talk that gets the most votes.</p><p>4 0.72112072 <a title="188-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-09-Today_in_the_sister_blog.html">1049 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-09-Today in the sister blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

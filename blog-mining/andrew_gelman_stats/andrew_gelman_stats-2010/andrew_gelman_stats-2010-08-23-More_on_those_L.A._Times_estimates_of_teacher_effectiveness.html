Here I’d like to highlight a few other things came up in  our</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 I read a bunch of research articles on teacher performance and was particularly impressed by the work of Jonah Rockoff and his collaborators, who found that teachers–but not schools–can make a big difference in student performance. [sent-13, score-0.377]
</p><p>2 First, there was a bit of back-and-forth about the feasibility of the proposal to switch to a system in which 80% of teachers are fired within their first two years. [sent-19, score-0.324]
</p><p>3 In addition, a statistical issue came up:  How variable are those estimates for individual teachers? [sent-21, score-0.367]
</p><p>4 Times article featured two teachers with extremely different scores, and I’m guessing that the difference between their ratings is statistically significant. [sent-24, score-0.324]
</p><p>5 If you just took two teachers at random from the middle of the pack, though, it might be difficult to really know which one is better than the other (on the test-score metric). [sent-25, score-0.324]
</p><p>6 At a technical level, I think they should use multilevel models, partly to get more accurate estimates for individual teachers and partly to address the multiple comparisons problems that will inevitably arise. [sent-26, score-0.783]
</p><p>7 It’s just a context specific brand name for using student test scores after controlling for other antecedents. [sent-31, score-0.339]
</p><p>8 The Buddin white paper does a fair job of describing the study and its broad results, but as Steve Sailer notes in the comments here and at Marginal Revolution, it does little to bolster the claim that the value-added estimates are useful for evaluation of individual instructors or schools. [sent-32, score-0.477]
</p><p>9 It will be interesting to see what form the LAT release of the individual teacher results takes. [sent-36, score-0.485]
</p><p>10 Can anyone here provide an informed opinion as to how much this might be expected to influence the validity of the estimates for individual teachers or schools? [sent-47, score-0.635]
</p><p>11 Given that the lagged test score is treated as a sufficient statistic for all prior inputs, I would expect this assumption to be violated. [sent-49, score-0.376]
</p><p>12 However, I question whether the assignments of students to teachers is sufficiently random for this not to impact the individual VAM estimates. [sent-51, score-0.493]
</p><p>13 If a teacher inherits most of each year’s incoming class from an especially (in)competent teacher in the lower grade, a situation that is likely to be persistent, would we not still expect the VAM estimate to be biased? [sent-52, score-0.707]
</p><p>14 I do note, comparing Table 4 with Table 8, (the teacher and school VAM are estimated independently) that though the coefficient estimate variance of the school effects is in Buddin’s words “quite small” while that of the schools is “large” the R-sq of the two models differ by less than 0. [sent-54, score-0.713]
</p><p>15 This makes me suspicious that neither the teacher effects nor the school effects add much to the model. [sent-57, score-0.371]
</p><p>16 It’s not legit to guess from comparisons of coefficient estimates and standard errors, but my guess would be that the lagged test scores are doing all of the heavy lifting in these models. [sent-58, score-0.67]
</p><p>17 My guess is that the Cohen’s f-squared for the individual teacher VAM is diminishingly small. [sent-59, score-0.434]
</p><p>18 In keeping with the Bayesian bent of this forum, by how much would one rationally revise one’s prior estimate of an individual teacher’s performance on the basis of this VAM estimate? [sent-60, score-0.337]
</p><p>19 Those authors estimate that restricting the grant of tenure only to teachers with VAM estimates in the top three quintiles would be expected to improve test scores by about 0. [sent-62, score-0.871]
</p><p>20 For example, I doubt I would share his concerns about the use of an added model for a bounded variable–this sort of thing is done all the time and causes little harm, you just have to treat the estimates as some sort of average predictive comparison. [sent-66, score-0.242]

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.

<p>Introduction: Jacob Hartog writes the following in reaction to  my post  on the use of value-added modeling for teacher assessment:
  
What I [Hartog] think has been inadequately discussed is the use of individual model specifications to assign these teacher ratings, rather than the zone of agreement across a broad swath of model specifications.


For example, the model used by NYCDOE doesn’t just control for a student’s prior year test score (as I think everyone can agree is a good idea.) It also assumes that different demographic groups will learn different amounts in a given year, and assigns a school-level random effect. The result is that, as was much ballyhooed at the time of the release of the data,the average teacher rating for a given school is roughly the same, no matter whether the school is performing great or terribly. The headline from this was “excellent teachers spread evenly across the city’s schools,” rather than “the specification of these models assume that excellent teachers are</p><p>4 0.2476929 <a title="226-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-12-%E2%80%9CTeaching_effectiveness%E2%80%9D_as_another_dimension_in_cognitive_ability.html">1620 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-12-“Teaching effectiveness” as another dimension in cognitive ability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m not a great teacher.  I can get by because I work hard and I know a lot, and for some students my classes are just great, but it’s not a natural talent of mine.  I know people who are amazing teachers, and they have something that I just don’t have.  I wrote that book, Teaching Statistics:  A Bag of Tricks (with Deb Nolan) because I’m  not  a good teacher and hence need to develop all sorts of techniques to be able to do what good teachers can do without even trying.
 
I’m not proud of being mediocre at teaching.  I don’t think that low teaching skill is some sort of indicator that I’m a great researcher.  The other think about teaching ability is that I think it’s hard to detect without actually seeing someone teach a class.  If you see me give a seminar presentation or even a guest lecture, you’d think I’m an awesome teacher.  But, actually, no.  I’m an excellent speaker, not such a great teacher.
 
This all came to mind when I received the following email from anthropologist Hen</p><p>5 0.20339186 <a title="226-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-30-Fixed_effects%2C_followed_by_Bayes_shrinkage%3F.html">1644 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-30-Fixed effects, followed by Bayes shrinkage?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stuart Buck writes:
  
I have a question about  fixed effects vs. random effects . Amongst economists who study teacher value-added, it has become common to see people saying that they estimated teacher fixed effects (via least squares dummy variables, so that there is a parameter for each teacher), but that they then applied empirical Bayes shrinkage so that the teacher effects are brought closer to the mean.  (See  this paper  by Jacob and Lefgren, for example.)


Can that really be what they are doing? Why wouldn’t they just run random (modeled) effects in the first place? I feel like there’s something I’m missing.
  
My reply:  I don’t know the full story here, but I’m thinking there are two goals, first to get an unbiased estimate of an overall treatment effect (and there the econometricians prefer so-called fixed effects; I disagree with them on this but I know where they’re coming from) and second to estimate individual teacher effects (and there it makes sense to use so-called</p><p>6 0.19601741 <a title="226-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Why_girls_do_better_in_school.html">1803 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Why girls do better in school</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>4 0.7975654 <a title="226-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Why_girls_do_better_in_school.html">1803 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Why girls do better in school</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.

<p>Introduction: This link  on education reform send me to  this blog  on foreign languages in Canadian public schools:
  
 
The demand for French immersion education in Vancouver so far outstrips the supply that the school board allocates places by lottery.


But why? Is it because French is a useful employment skill? Because learning to speak French makes you a better person? Or is it because parents know intuitively what economists can show econometrically: peer effects matter. Being with high achieving peers raises a student’s own achievement level. . . .


Several studies have found that Anglophones who can speak French enjoy an earning premium. The question is: do bilingual Anglophones earn more because speaking French is a valuable skill in the workplace? Or do they earn more because they’re on average smarter and more capable people (after all, they’ve mastered two languages)?

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>2 0.98407692 <a title="226-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Non-statistical_thinking_in_the_US_foreign_policy_establishment.html">721 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Non-statistical thinking in the US foreign policy establishment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a few weeks behind in my New Yorker reading and so just recently read  this fascinating article  by Ryan Lizza on the current administration’s foreign policy.  He gives some insights into the transformation Obama from antiwar candidate to a president conducting three wars.
 
Speaking as a statistician, though, what grabbed my eye was a doctrine of journalist/professor/policymaker Samantha Power.  Lizza writes:
  
In 2002, after graduating from Harvard Law School, she wrote “A Problem from Hell,” which surveyed the grim history of six genocides committed in the twentieth century. Propounding a liberal-interventionist view, Power argued that “mass killing” on the scale of Rwanda or Bosnia must be prevented by other nations, including the United States. She wrote that America and its allies rarely have perfect information about when a regime is about to commit genocide; a President, therefore, must have “a bias toward belief” that massacres are imminent.

<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.

<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

I work at National Prescribing Services in Australia.  I have a database representing say, antidiabetic drug utilisation for the entire Australia in the past few years. I planned to do a longitudinal analysis across GP Division Network (112 divisions in AUS) using mixed-effects models (or as you called in your book varying intercept and varying slope) on this data. 


The problem here is: as data actually represent the population who use antidiabetic drugs in AUS, should I use 112 fixed dummy variables to capture the random variations or use varying intercept and varying slope for the model ? Because some one may aruge, like divisions in AUS or states in USA can hardly be considered from a “superpopulation”, then fixed dummies should be used.  What I think is the population are those who use the drugs, what will happen when the rest need to use them? In terms of exchangeability, using varying intercept and varying slopes can be justified.

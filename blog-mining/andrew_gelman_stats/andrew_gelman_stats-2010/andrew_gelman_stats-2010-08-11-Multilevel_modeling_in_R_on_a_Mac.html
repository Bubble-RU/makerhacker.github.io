<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)

<p>Introduction: I switched to the mac and it’s great  I’d like a bit more real estate on my laptop but Malecki assures me that soon I’ll get used to jumping between windows.
 
Anyway, my impression is that now the mac dominates the pc, but a few years ago it wasn’t so clear.  The mac had some nice features but often ran slowly, and thinkpads could do a lot.  At the time, the way I understood this was that only one company made macs but several made pc’s, thus there was a lot of competition, stimulating innovation in the pc market.
 
But what’s the story now?  The macbook air is awesome and a real advance on what came before, while the thinkpads and all the rest have stagnated.  So what’s my new theory?  There’s lots of competition on pc’s, but what they’re all competing on is price.  Meanwhile, only one company makes the mac and so they have the freedom to make something good.
 
But I’m just blathering here.  I’m sure someone can offer some thick description to reveal the real story.</p><p>5 0.11610427 <a title="198-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-09-Both_R_and_Stata.html">76 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-09-Both R and Stata</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student I’m working with writes:
  
I was planning on getting a applied stat text as a desk reference, and for that I’m assuming you’d recommend your own book. Also, being an economics student, I was initially planning on doing my analysis in STATA, but I noticed on your blog that you use R, and apparently so does the rest of the statistics profession. Would you rather I do my programming in R this summer, or does it not matter? It doesn’t look too hard to learn, so just let me know what’s most convenient for you.
  
My reply:  Yes, I recommend my book with Jennifer Hill.  Also the book by John Fox, An R and S-plus Companion to Applied Regression, is a good way to get into R.  I recommend you use both Stata and R.  If you’re already familiar with Stata, then stick with it–it’s a great system for working with big datasets.  You can grab your data in Stata, do some basic manipulations, then save a smaller dataset to read into R (using R’s read.dta() function).

I [Hadley] am going to be teaching an R development master class in New York City on Dec 
12-13. The basic idea of the class is to help you write better code, 
focused on the mantra of “do not repeat yourself”. In day one you will 
learn powerful new tools of abstraction, allowing you to solve a wider 
range of problems with fewer lines of code. Day two will teach you how 
to make packages, the fundamental unit of code distribution in R, 
allowing others to save time by allowing them to use your code.


To get the most out of this course, you should have some experience 
programming in R already: you should be familiar with writing 
functions, and the basic data structures of R: vectors, matrices, 
arrays, lists and data frames. You will find the course particularly 
useful if you’re an experienced R user looking to take the next step, 
or if you’re moving to R from other programming languages and you want 
to quickly get up to speed with R’s unique features. A coupl</p><p>4 0.63966769 <a title="198-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-09-iPython_Notebook.html">1716 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-09-iPython Notebook</a></p>

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.

I’m using your text, Data Analysis Using Regression & Multilevel/Hierarchical Models as the basis for an independent study class this fall. I am fairly adapt with Stata, however I have no expertise in R (changing this condition is a goal of the independent study!).


I’m working to get up and running with the examples from the book, but I’m running into several problems, all apparently stemming from my having a Mac as opposed to a PC. Specifically I cannot load the “arm” library because I cannot install the lme4 library as lme4 is not available for Macs.

Here are steps for you to install lme4:


1. update your x11 code for Mac system (so that you have gcc and g77 complier)


2. download source code for lme4 from the CRAN.


3. install lme4 from the source you just downloaded.


I am not a Mac user.  I am adapting steps from installing lme4 in a linux OS.

<p>Introduction: Jim Hodges posted a note to the Bugs mailing list that I thought could be of more general interest: 
  
  
Is multi-modality a common experience?  I [Hodges] think the answer is “nobody knows in any generality”.  Here are some examples of bimodality that certainly do *not* involve the kind of labeling problems that arise in mixture models.


The only systematic study of multimodality I know of is 


Liu J, Hodges JS (2003).  Posterior bimodality in the balanced one-way random effects model.  J.~Royal Stat.~Soc., Ser.~B, 65:247-255.


The surprise of this paper is that in the simplest possible hierarchical model (analyzed using the standard inverse-gamma priors for the two variances), bimodality occurs quite readily, although it is much less common to have two modes that are big enough so that you’d actually get a noticeable fraction of MCMC draws from both of them.  Because the restricted likelihood (= the marginal posterior for the two variances, if you’ve put flat priors on them) is</p><p>3 0.87804717 <a title="198-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-What_are_the_trickiest_models_to_fit%3F.html">575 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-What are the trickiest models to fit?</a></p>

What do you and your readers think are the trickiest models to fit? If I had an algorithm that I claimed could fit many models with little fuss, what kinds of models would really impress you? I am interested in testing different MCMC sampling methods to evaluate their performance and I want to stretch the bounds of their abilities.
  
I don’t know what’s the trickiest, but just about anything I work on in a serious way gives me some troubles.  This reminds me that we should finish our Bayesian Benchmarks paper already.</p><p>4 0.8716985 <a title="198-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-19-Sharon_Begley%3A__Worse_than_Stephen_Jay_Gould%3F.html">1128 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-19-Sharon Begley:  Worse than Stephen Jay Gould?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Tggp  links  to a criticism of science journalist Sharon Begley by science journalist Matthew Hutson.  I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”

<p>Introduction: Dan Hopkins sends along  this article :
  
[Hopkins] uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the turnout and election impacts of Spanish-language assistance provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Analyses of two different data sets – the Latino National Survey and California 1998 primary election returns – show that Spanish-language assistance increased turnout for citizens who speak little English. The California results also demonstrate that election procedures an influence outcomes, as support for ending bilingual education dropped markedly in heavily Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with Spanish-language assistance. The California analyses find hints of backlash among non-Hispanic white precincts, but not with the same size or certainty. Small changes in election procedures can influence who votes as well as what wins.
  
Beyond the direct relevance of these results, I find this paper interesting as an example of research that is fundamentally quantitative.

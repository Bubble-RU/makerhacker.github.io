<p>Introduction: Shankar Vedantam  writes :
  
Americans distrust the GOP. So why are they voting for it? . . . Gallup tells us that 71 percent of all Americans blame Republican policies for the bad economy, while only 48 percent blame the Obama administration. . . . while disapproval of congressional Democrats stands at 61 percent, disapproval of congressional Republicans stands at 67 percent.


[But] Republicans are heavily tipped to wrest control of one or both houses of Congress from the Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
  
Hey!  I know the answer to that one.  As I  wrote  in early September:
  
 
Those 10% or so of voters who plan to vote Republican–even while thinking that the Democrats will do a better job–are not necessarily being so unreasonable. The Democrats control the presidency and both houses of Congress, and so it’s a completely reasonable stance to prefer them to the Republicans yet still think they’ve gone too far and need a check on their power.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  discusses  a radio interview on the effect of parents on children’s education.  In short, the interviewer (Stephen Dubner of Freakonomics fame) claims that the research shows that parents don’t have much influence on whether their children go to college.  The evidence is based on a comparison of adopted and non-adopted children.  Palko makes a convincing case that the statistical analysis (by economist Bruce Sacerdote) doesn’t show what Dubner says it shows.
 
I looked over the linked transcript, and overall I’m less unhappy than Palko is about the interview.  I agree that some of the causal implications are sloppy, and I think it’s a bit silly for the interviewer (Kai Ryssdal) to use celebrities as a benchmark.  (Ryssdal says, “if [a certain parenting style is] good enough for Steven Levitt, it’s good enough for me.”  But Levitt is a multimillionaire—he’ll always have a huge financial cushion.  It’s not clear that what works for him would work for others who are not so wel</p><p>6 0.12360738 <a title="416-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>4 0.74295908 <a title="416-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-Who_gets_wedding_announcements_in_the_Times%3F.html">370 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-Who gets wedding announcements in the Times?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . . I assume discrimination must be going on somep</p><p>6 0.73282677 <a title="416-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, here’s something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who’s famous for his innovative treatment for “phantom limb” pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . “Oh, my God!” the man began</p><p>2 0.94858336 <a title="416-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-Improvements_to_Kindle_Version_of_BDA3.html">1993 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-Improvements to Kindle Version of BDA3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>3 0.94297469 <a title="416-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.
 
I guess what I’m saying is:</p><p>4 0.93325007 <a title="416-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-23-Special_effects.html">1426 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-23-Special effects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>6 0.92401958 <a title="416-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>

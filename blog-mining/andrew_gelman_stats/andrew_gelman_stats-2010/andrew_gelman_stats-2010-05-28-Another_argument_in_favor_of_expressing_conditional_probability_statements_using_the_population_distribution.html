Do you know what might lead to a large negative cross-correlation (-0.95) between deviance and one of the model parameters?


Here’s the (brief) background:


I [Richardson] have written a Bayesian hierarchical site occupancy model for presence of disease on individual amphibians. The response variable is therefore binary (disease present/absent) and the probability of disease being present in an individual (psi) depends on various covariates (species of amphibian, location sampled, etc.) paramaterized using a logit link function.  Replicates are individuals sampled (tested for presence of disease) together.  The possibility of imperfect detection is included as p = (prob. disease detected given disease is present).


Posterior distributions were estimated using WinBUGS via R2WinBUGS. 
Simulated data from the model fit the real data very well and posterior distribution densities seem robust to any changes in the model (different priors, etc.)  All autocor</p><p>3 0.19014268 <a title="56-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-27-Hype_about_conditional_probability_puzzles.html">54 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-27-Hype about conditional probability puzzles</a></p>

The first thing you think is “What has Tuesday got to do with it?” Well, it has everything to do with it.
  
I thought I should really figure this one out myself before reading any further, and I decided this was a good time to apply my general principle that it’s always best to solve such problems from scratch rather than trying to guess at the answer.
  

 
So I laid out all the 4 x 49 possibilities.  The 4 is bb, bg, gb, gg, and the 49 are all possible pairs of days of the week.  Then I ruled out all the possibilities that were inconsistent with the data:  this leaves the following:
 
bb with all pairs of days that include a Tuesday.  That’s 13 possibilities (Mon/Tues, Tues/Tues, Wed/Tues, …, Tues/Mon, …, Sun/Tues, remembering not to count Tues/Tues twice).

<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
I have an interesting thought on a prior for a logistic regression, and would love your input on how to make it “work.”


Some of my research, two published papers, are on mathematical models of **.  Along those lines, I’m interested in developing more models for **. . . .  Empirical studies show that the public is rather smart and that the wisdom-of-the-crowd is fairly accurate.


So, my thought would be to tread the public’s probability of the event as a prior, and then see how adding data, through a model, would change or perturb our inferred probability of **.  (Similarly, I could envision using previously published epidemiological research as a prior probability of a disease, and then seeing how the addition of new testing protocols would update that belief.)


However, everything I learned about hierarchical Bayesian models has a prior as a distribution on the coefficients.

Here’s a story of R-squared = 1%. Consider a 0/1 outcome with about half the people in each category. For.example, half the people with some disease die in a year and half live. Now suppose there’s a treatment that increases survival rate from 50% to 60%. The unexplained sd is 0.5 and the explained sd is 0.05, hence R-squared is 0.01.</p><p>6 0.14329834 <a title="56-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-10-Another_reason_why_you_can_get_good_inferences_from_a_bad_model.html">1527 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-10-Another reason why you can get good inferences from a bad model</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I had the following email exchange with a reader of Bayesian Data Analysis.
  

 
 My correspondent wrote:   Exercise 1(b) involves evaluating the normal pdf at a single point. But p(Y=y|mu,sigma) = 0 (and is not simply N(y|mu,sigma)), since the normal distribution is continuous. So it seems that part (b) of the exercise is inappropriate.
 
The solution does actually evaluate the probability as the value of the pdf at the single point, which is wrong. The probabilities should all be 0, so the answer to (b) is undefined.
 
 I replied:   The pdf is the probability density function, which for a continuous distribution is defined as the derivative of the cumulative density function.  The notation in BDA is rigorous but we do not spell out all the details, so I can see how confusion is possible. 
 
 My correspondent:   I agree that the pdf is the derivative of the cdf. But to compute P(a .lt. Y .lt. b) for a continuous distribution (with support in the real line) requires integrating over t</p><p>3 0.79580307 <a title="56-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-27-Hype_about_conditional_probability_puzzles.html">54 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-27-Hype about conditional probability puzzles</a></p>

<p>Introduction: William Perkins, Mark Tygert, and Rachel Ward  write :
  
If a discrete probability distribution in a model being tested for goodness-of-fit is not close to uniform, then forming the Pearson χ2 statistic can involve division by nearly zero. This often leads to serious trouble in practice — even in the absence of round-off errors . . .
  
The problem is not merely that the chi-squared  statistic  doesn’t have the advertised chi-squared  distribution —a reference distribution can always be computed via simulation, either using the posterior predictive distribution or by conditioning on a point estimate of the cell expectations and then making a degrees-of-freedom sort of adjustment.
 
Rather, the problem is that, when there are lots of cells with near-zero expectation, the chi-squared test is mostly noise.

I am having trouble thinking Bayesianly about the so-called ‘normal’ or ‘reference’ values that I am supposed to use in some of the tests I perform. These values are obtained from purportedly healthy people. Setting aside concerns about ascertainment bias, non-parametric distributions, and the like, the values are usually obtained by setting the limits at ± 2SD from the mean. In some cases, supposedly because of a non-normal distribution, the third highest and lowest value observed in the healthy group sets the limits, on the assumption that no more than 2 results (out of 20 samples) are allowed to exceed these values: if there are 3 or more, then the test is assumed to be abnormal and the reference range is said to reflect the 90th percentile. The results are binary – normal, abnormal.


The relevance to the diseased state is this. People who are known unequivocally to have condition X show Y abnormalities in these tests. Therefore, when people suspected</p><p>6 0.69503534 <a title="56-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Creating_a_good_wager_based_on_probability_estimates.html">138 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Creating a good wager based on probability estimates</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).

<p>Introduction: Yesterday we had a spirited  discussion  of the following conditional probability puzzle:
  
“I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”
  
This reminded me of the principle, familiar from  statistics instruction  and the  cognitive psychology  literature, that the best way to teach these sorts of examples is through integers rather than fractions.
 
For example, consider this classic problem:
  
“10% of persons have disease X.  You are tested for the disease and test positive, and the test has 80% accuracy.  What is the probability that you have the disease?”
  
This can be solved directly using conditional probability but it appears to be clearer to do it using integers:
  
Start with 100 people.  10 will have the disease and 90 will not.  Of the 10 with the disease, 8 will test positive and 2 will test negative.  Of the 90 without the disease, 18 will test positive and 72% will test negative.  (72% = 0.8*90.)  So, out of the origin</p><p>3 0.98322439 <a title="56-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-17-Death%21.html">962 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-17-Death!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This graph shows the estimate that Kenny Shirley and I have of support for the death penalty by sex and race in the U.S. since 1955:
 
   
 
We also found that capital punishment used to be more popular in the Northeast than in the South, but now it’s the other way around.
 
Here’s the abstract to  our paper :
  
One of the longest running questions that has been regularly included in Gallup’s national public opinion poll is “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Because the death penalty is governed by state laws rather than federal laws, it is of special interest to know how public opinion varies by state, and how it has changed over time within each state. In this paper we combine dozens of national polls taken over a fifty-year span and fit a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to individual response data to estimate changes in state-level public opinion over time. Such a long span of polls has not been analyzed this way before, partly</p><p>4 0.97890383 <a title="56-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Why_girls_do_better_in_school.html">1803 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Why girls do better in school</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

<p>Introduction: In reaction to  this  news article by Michael Kimmelman, I’d like to repost  this  from four years ago:
  
Walking through Penn Station in New York, I remembered how much I love its open structure. By “open,” I don’t mean bright and airy. I mean “open” in a topological sense. The station has three below-ground levels–the uppermost has ticket counters (and, what is more relevant nowadays, ticket machines), some crappy stores and restaurants, and a crappy waiting area. The middle level has Long Island Rail Road ticket counters, some more crappy stores and restaurants, and entrances to the 7th and 8th Avenue subway lines. The lower level has train tracks and platforms. There are stairs, escalators, and elevators going everywhere. As a result, it’s easy to get around, there are lots of shortcuts, and the train loads fast–some people come down the escalators and elevators from the top level, others take the stairs from the middle level.

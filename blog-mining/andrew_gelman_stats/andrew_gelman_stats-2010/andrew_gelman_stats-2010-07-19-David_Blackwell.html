<p>Introduction: This is a chance for me to combine two of my interests–politics and statistics–and probably to irritate both halves of the readership of this blog.  Anyway…
 
I recently  wrote  about the apparent correlation between Bayes/non-Bayes statistical ideology and liberal/conservative political ideology:
  
The Bayes/non-Bayes fissure had a bit of a political dimension–with anti-Bayesians being the old-line conservatives (for example, Ronald Fisher) and Bayesians having a more of a left-wing flavor (for example, Dennis Lindley). Lots of counterexamples at an individual level, but my impression is that on average the old curmudgeonly, get-off-my-lawn types were (with some notable exceptions) more likely to be anti-Bayesian.
  
This was somewhat based on my experiences at Berkeley.  Actually, some of the cranky anti-Bayesians were probably Democrats as well, but when they were being anti-Bayesian they seemed pretty conservative.
 
Recently I received an interesting item from Gerald Cliff, a pro</p><p>4 0.083681412 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-25-Ways_of_knowing.html">1469 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-25-Ways of knowing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>5 0.08220154 <a title="155-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-21-The_future_%28and_past%29_of_statistical_sciences.html">2072 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-21-The future (and past) of statistical sciences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In connection with  this  workshop, I was asked to write a few paragraphs describing my perspective on “the current and near-term future state of the statistical sciences you are most familiar with.”  Here’s what I wrote:
  
I think that, at any given time, the field of statistics has a core, but that core changes over time.  There are different paradigmatic ways to solve problems.


100 or 150 years ago, the thing to do was to identify a phenomenon of interest with some probability distribution and then use the mathematics of that distribution to gain insight into the underlying process.  Thus, for example, if certain data looked like they came from a normal distribution, one could surmise that the values in question arose by adding many small independent pieces.  If the data looked like they came from a binomial distribution, that would imply independence and equal probabilities.  Waiting times that followed an exponential distribution could be considered as coming from a memoryless</p><p>6 0.08101432 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-01-Going_meta_on_Niall_Ferguson.html">1921 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-01-Going meta on Niall Ferguson</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak reports:
  
I [Ziliak] am sorry to share this sad news about Arnold Zellner (AEA Distinguished Fellow, 2002, ASA President, 1991, ISBA co-founding president, all around genius and sweet fellow), who died yesterday morning (August 11, 2010).   He was a truly great statistician and to me and to many others a generous and wonderful friend, colleague, and hero.  I will miss him.


His cancer was spreading everywhere though you wouldn’t know it as his energy level was Arnold’s typical: abnormally high.  But then he had a stroke just a few days after an unsuccessful surgery “to help with breathing” the doctor said, and the combination of events weakened him terribly.  He was vibrant through June and much of July, and maintained an 8 hour work day at the office.  He never lost his sense of humor nor his joy of life.  He died at home in hospice care and fortunately he did not suffer long.

<p>Introduction: American University in Washington, D.C. has  two full-time tenure-line positions available :
  
An ideal candidate will have facility with computation, and can identify specific prospects for on-campus collaboration, possibly interdepartmental. We are particularly interested in candidates who can assist colleagues who need to deal with data sets that are too large, distributed, or heterogeneous to be amenable to traditional methods of analysis. From a mathematician, we also seek a research program with deep roots in mathematics.  From a statistician, we seek a familiarity with Bayesian modeling. We are open to researchers who ignore traditional disciplinary boundaries.
  
I like the bits about computation, interdepartmental, and Bayesian modeling.  My former colleagues at Berkeley would be spinning in their theorems were they to see this (but, don’t worry, I doubt they read blogs).  I really do think that computation is more important than theorem-proving.  Both are important (for exam</p><p>4 0.75573069 <a title="155-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-27-Should_statistics_have_a_Nobel_prize%3F.html">2151 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-27-Should statistics have a Nobel prize?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>5 0.73757839 <a title="155-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-07-Jenny_Davidson_wins_Mark_Van_Doren_Award%2C_also_some_reflections_on_the_continuity_of_work_within_literary_criticism_or_statistics.html">22 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-07-Jenny Davidson wins Mark Van Doren Award, also some reflections on the continuity of work within literary criticism or statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For “humanity, devotion to truth and inspiring leadership” at Columbia College.  Reading Jenny’s  remarks  (“my hugest and most helpful pool of colleagues was to be found not among the ranks of my fellow faculty but in the classroom. . . . we shared a sense of the excitement of the enterprise on which we were all embarked”) reminds me of the comment Seth made once, that the usual goal of university teaching is to make the students into carbon copies of the instructor, and that he found it to me much better to make use of the students’ unique strengths.  This can’t  always  be true–for example, in learning to speak a foreign language, I just want to be able to do it, and my own experiences in other domains is not so relevant.  But for a worldly subject such as literature or statistics or political science, then, yes, I do think it would be good for students to get involved and use their own knowledge and experiences.
 
One other statement of Jenny’s caught my eye.  She wrote:

<p>Introduction: After seeing  this graph :
 
   
 
I have the following message for Sharad:
 
Rotate the graph 90 degrees so you can see the words.  Also you can ditch the lines.  Then what you have is a dotplot, following the principles of Cleveland (1985).  You can lay out a few on one page to see some interactions with demographics.
 
 The real challenge here . . . 
 
. . . is to automate this sort of advice.  Or maybe we just need a really nice dotplot() function and enough examples, and people will start doing it?
 
 P.S. 
 
Often a lineplot is better.  See  here  for a discussion of another Sharad example.</p><p>2 0.96512556 <a title="155-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-25-And_now%2C_here%E2%80%99s_something_we_hope_you%E2%80%99ll_really_like.html">1343 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-25-And now, here’s something we hope you’ll really like</a></p>

Postdoctoral Researcher (3 years) in State-Space Modeling of Animal Movement and Population Dynamics in Universities of Turku and Helsinki, Finland


We seek for a statistician/mathematician with experience in ecological modeling or an ecologist with strong quantitative training to join an interdisciplinary research team focusing on dispersal and dynamics of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans).


The Postdoctoral Researcher will develop modeling approaches (from individual based models to population level models) to assess the dispersal and population dynamics of the flying squirrel. A key challenge will be the integration of different kinds of data (census data, telemetry data, mark-recapture data, life-history data, and data on environmental covariates such as forest structure) into the modeling framework using Bayesian State-Space models or other such approaches.


The project will be supervised by Dr. Vesa Selonen (a flying squirrel specialist;</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96481448 <a title="155-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-19-David_Blackwell.html">155 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-19-David Blackwell</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Blackwell was already retired by the time I came to Berkeley, and probably our closest connection was that I taught the class in decision theory that he used to teach.  I enjoyed that class a lot, partly because it took me out of my usual comfort zone of statistical inference and data analysis toward something more theoretical and mathematical.  Blackwell was one of the legendary figures in the department at that time and was also one of the most tolerant of alternative approaches to statistics, perhaps because of combination of a mathematical background, applied research in the war and after (which I learned about in  this recent obituary ), and personal experiences,
 
Blackwell may be best known in statistics for the  Rao-Blackwell theorem .  Rao, of course, is also famoust for the Cramer-Rao lower bound.  Both theorems relate to minimum-variance statistical estimators.
 
Here’s a quote from Thomas (Jesus’s dad) Ferguson in Blackwell’s  obituary :

<p>Introduction: Continuing with my discussion  here  and  here  of the articles in the special issue of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
David Hendry, “Empirical Economic Model Discovery and Theory Evaluation”:
 
Hendry presents a wide-ranging overview of scientific learning, with an interesting comparison of physical with social sciences.  (For some reason, he discusses many physical sciences but restricts his social-science examples to economics and psychology.)
 
The only part of Hendry’s long and interesting article that I will discuss, however, is the part where he decides to take a gratuitous swing at Bayes.  I don’t know why he did this, but maybe it’s part of some fraternity initiation thing, like TP-ing the dean’s house on Halloween.
 
Here’s the story.  Hendry writes:
  
‘Prior distributions’ widely used in Bayesian analyses, whether subjective or ‘objective’, cannot be formed in such a setting either, absent a falsely assumed crys</p><p>5 0.95862293 <a title="155-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Herman_Chernoff_used_to_do_that_too%3B_also%2C_some_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_preferences.html">334 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Herman Chernoff used to do that too; also, some puzzlement over another’s puzzlement over another’s preferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Levitt  writes :.
  
 
Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.
 
P.S.  Levitt also writes:
  
The one thing that puzzles me [Levitt] is why in the world would he want to be on the Board of the Federal Reserve? One thing economists just don’t understand are people’s preferences.
  
To get meta here for a moment . . . just as Levitt can’t understand Diamond’s preferences, I find it extremely difficult to understand that Levitt is puzzled by Diamond’s desire to serve on the Federal Reserve,
 
It’s obvious, no?  Diamond has expertise on macroeconomics and, I assume, some strong and well-informed opinions on monetary policy; the Federal Reserve determ</p><p>6 0.94223225 <a title="155-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-05-%E2%80%9CNumbersense%3A__How_to_use_big_data_to_your_advantage%E2%80%9D.html">1927 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-05-“Numbersense:  How to use big data to your advantage”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)
 
Here I’d like to highlight a few other things came up in  our</p><p>4 0.15341169 <a title="261-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Estimating_and_reporting_teacher_effectivenss%3A__Newspaper_researchers_do_things_that_academic_researchers_never_could.html">222 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Estimating and reporting teacher effectivenss:  Newspaper researchers do things that academic researchers never could</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.  For example, from an  official documen t, “The primary purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participati</p><p>5 0.15047152 <a title="261-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-01-%E2%80%9COn_Inspiring_Students_and_Being_Human%E2%80%9D.html">1517 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-01-“On Inspiring Students and Being Human”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  points  to a  news article  by Michael Winerip on teacher assessment:
  
No one at the Lab Middle School for Collaborative Studies works harder than Stacey Isaacson, a seventh-grade English and social studies teacher. She is out the door of her Queens home by 6:15 a.m., takes the E train into Manhattan and is standing out front when the school doors are unlocked, at 7. Nights, she leaves her classroom at 5:30. . . .


Her principal, Megan Adams, has given her terrific reviews during the two and a half years Ms. Isaacson has been a teacher. . . . The Lab School has selective admissions, and Ms. Isaacson’s students have excelled. Her first year teaching, 65 of 66 scored proficient on the state language arts test, meaning they got 3′s or 4′s; only one scored below grade level with a 2. More than two dozen students from her first two years teaching have gone on to . . . the city’s most competitive high schools. . . .

<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.
 
2.  Subtract points for taking the SAT multiple times.  A simple rule would be:  You can use your highest SAT score, but you lose 50 points for every other time</p><p>5 0.7701087 <a title="261-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-Homework_and_treatment_levels.html">542 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-Homework and treatment levels</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>6 0.76173371 <a title="261-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>

 This  simply screams “post-hoc, multiple comparisons problem,” though I haven’t seen the paper.


A quote from the  online news report :


The findings revealed that kindergarten matters–a lot.  Students of kindergarten teachers with above-average experience earn $900 more in annual wages than students of teachers with less experience than average. Being in a class of 15 students instead of a class of 22 increased students’ chances of attending college, especially for children who were disadvantaged . . . Children whose test scores improved to the 60th percentile were also less likely to become single parents, more likely to own a home by age 28, and more likely to save for retirement earlier in their work lives.
  
I haven’t seen the paper either.  $900 doesn’t seem like so much to me, but I suppose it depends where you stand on the income ladder.
 
Regarding the multiple comparisons problem:  this could be a great example for fitting a  multilevel model .

<p>Introduction: Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson  write :
  
Financial crises are staggeringly costly. Only major wars rival them in the burdens they place on public finances. Taxpayers typically transfer enormous resources to banks, their stockholders, and creditors, while public debt explodes and the economy runs below full employment for years. This paper compares how relatively large, developed countries have handled bailouts over time. It analyzes why some have done better than others at containing costs and protecting taxpayers. The paper argues that political variables – the nature of competition within party systems and voting turnout – help explain why some countries do more than others to limit the moral hazards of bailouts.
  
I know next to nothing about this topic, so I’ll just recommend you click through and read the article yourself.  Here’s a bit more:

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.
 
2.  A year after I graduated, the landlord actually did sell the place but then, when my friends moved out, he refused to pay back their security deposit.  There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.  So they sued the landlord in Mass. housing court</p><p>4 0.95525593 <a title="261-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Our_new_improved_blog%21__Thanks_to_Cord_Blomquist.html">856 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Our new improved blog!

<p>Introduction: Hi all.  You may have noticed changes in the appearance of the blog.   Cord Blomquist  moved us over to this new WordPress blog.  He earlier did it for our sister blog and he can do it for you too, for a reasonable fee.  We had a few hitches in getting all the files and links and comments working, and Cord was with us all the way to straighten things out.  Thanks, Cord!  You did a great job and we’re happy to recommend you to others.
 
P.S.  The last thing we got working was the RSS feed.  So if you’ve been reading the blog on RSS, you have about 3 weeks of backlog you can catch up on.
 
P.P.S.  We’re still playing a bit with the blog’s formatting.  Feel free to put any formatting suggestions in the comments.</p><p>5 0.95158863 <a title="261-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-21-Job_openings_at_conservative_political_analytics_firm%21.html">1909 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-21-Job openings at conservative political analytics firm!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After posting that  announcement  about Civis Analytics, I wrote, “If a reconstituted Romney Analytics team is hiring, let me know and I’ll post that ad too.”  Adam Schaeffer  obliged :
  

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.


We’re looking for new talent to help with our fast-growing portfolio in these areas:

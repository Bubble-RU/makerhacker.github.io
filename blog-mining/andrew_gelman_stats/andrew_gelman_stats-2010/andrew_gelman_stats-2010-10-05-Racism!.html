<p>Introduction: Majid Ezzati writes:
  
My research group is increasingly focusing on a series of problems that involve data that either have missingness or measurements that may have bias/error.  We have at times developed our own approaches to imputation (as simple as interpolating a missing unit and as sophisticated as a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model) and at other times, other groups impute the data. 


The outputs are being used to investigate the basic associations between pairs of variables, Xs and Ys, in regressions; we may or may not interpret these as causal.  I am contacting colleagues with relevant expertise to suggest good references on whether having imputed X and/or Y in a subsequent regression is correct or if it could somehow lead to biased/spurious associations.   Thinking about this, we can have at least the following situations (these could all be Bayesian or not):

I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution?

<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>5 0.1022555 <a title="321-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-15-The_bias-variance_tradeoff.html">960 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-15-The bias-variance tradeoff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein asks for my thoughts as  a Bayesian on the above topic.  So here they are (briefly):
 
The concept of the bias-variance tradeoff can be useful if you don’t take it too seriously.  The basic idea is as follows:  if you’re estimating something, you can slice your data finer and finer, or perform more and more adjustments, each time getting a purer—and less biased—estimate.  But each subdivision or each adjustment reduces your sample size or increases potential estimation error, hence the variance of your estimate goes up.
 
That story is real.  In lots and lots of examples, there’s a continuum between a completely unadjusted general estimate (high bias, low variance) and a specific, focused, adjusted estimate (low bias, high variance).
 
Suppose, for example, you’re using data from a large experiment to estimate the effect of a treatment on a fairly narrow group, say, white men between the ages of 45 and 50.  At one extreme, you could just take the estimated treatment e</p><p>6 0.098213822 <a title="321-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-28-Thoughts_on_Groseclose_book_on_media_bias.html">828 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-28-Thoughts on Groseclose book on media bias</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.

<p>Introduction: This assessment  by Tyler Cowen reminded me that, in 1980, I and just about all my friends hated Jimmy Carter.  Most of us much preferred him to Reagan but still hated Carter.  I wouldn’t associate this with any particular ideological feeling—it’s not that we thought he was too liberal, or too conservative.  He just seemed completely ineffectual.  I remember feeling at the time that he had no principles, that he’d do anything to get elected.
 
In retrospect, I think of this as an instance of uniform partisan swing:  the president was unpopular nationally, and attitudes about him were negative, relatively speaking, among just about every group.
 
My other Carter story comes from a conversation I had a couple years ago with an economist who’s about my age, a man who said that one reason he and his family moved from town A to town B in his metropolitan area was that, in town B, they didn’t feel like they were the only Republicans on their block.

<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>3 0.98482943 <a title="321-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-How_do_segregation_measures_change_when_you_change_the_level_of_aggregation%3F.html">1366 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-How do segregation measures change when you change the level of aggregation?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>4 0.98345649 <a title="321-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-16-Visualizations_of_NYPD_stop-and-frisk_data.html">1014 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-16-Visualizations of NYPD stop-and-frisk data</a></p>

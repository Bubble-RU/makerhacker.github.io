<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .


But if Freedom is middlebrow, it is so in the sacrosanct Don DeLillo tradition, which our critical establishment considers central to literature today. . . .

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman  refers  to finite mixture models as “beasts” and  writes  jokes that they “should be avoided at all costs.”
 
I’ve thought a lot about mixture models, ever since using them in an  analysis  of voting patterns that was published in 1990.  First off, I’d like to say that our model was useful so I’d prefer not to pay the cost of avoiding it.  For a quick description of our mixture model and its context, see pp. 379-380 of my  article  in the Jim Berger volume).  Actually, our case was particularly difficult because we were not even fitting a mixture model to data, we were fitting it to latent data and using the model to perform partial pooling.  My difficulties in trying to fit this model inspired our discussion of mixture models in Bayesian Data Analysis (page 109 in the second edition, in the section on “Counterexamples to the theorems”).
 
I agree with Larry that if you’re fitting a mixture model, it’s good to be aware of the problems that arise if you try to estimate</p><p>5 0.069425851 <a title="119-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-21-Literary_blurb_translation_guide.html">723 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-21-Literary blurb translation guide</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just reviewed the book Bursts, by Albert-László Barabási, for Physics Today.  But I had a lot more to say that couldn’t fit into the magazine’s 800-word limit.  Here I’ll reproduce what I sent to Physics Today, followed by my additional thoughts.
  
The back cover of Bursts book promises “a revolutionary new theory showing how we can predict human behavior.”  I wasn’t fully convinced on that score, but the book does offer a well-written and thought-provoking window into author Albert-László Barabási’s research in power laws and network theory.


Power laws–the mathematical pattern that little things are common and large things are rare–have been observed in many different domains, including incomes (as noted by economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth century), word frequencies (as noted by linguist George Zipf), city sizes, earthquakes, and virtually anything else that can be measured.  In the mid-twentieth century, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot devoted an influential caree</p><p>5 0.66675192 <a title="119-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-05-The_New_York_Times_Book_of_Mathematics.html">1843 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-05-The New York Times Book of Mathematics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This was an good idea:  take a bunch of old (and some recent) news articles on developments in mathematics and related ares from the past hundred years.  Fun for the math content and historical/nostalgia value.  Relive the four-color theorem, Fermat, fractals, and early computing.
 
I have too much of a technical bent to be the ideal reader for this sort of book, but it seems like an excellent gift for a non-technical reader who nonetheless enjoys math.  (I assume that such people are out there, just as there are people like me who canâ&euro;&trade;t read music but still enjoy reading about the subject.)
 
The book is organized by topic.  My own preference would have been chronological and with more old stuff.  I particularly enjoyed the material from many decades ago, such as the news report on one of the early computers.  This must have been a fun book to compile.</p><p>6 0.66460127 <a title="119-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-21-Why_modern_art_is_all_in_the_mind.html">102 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-21-Why modern art is all in the mind</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A  comment  by Mark Palko reminded me that, while I’m a huge  Marquand  fan, I think The Late George Apley is way overrated.  My theory is that Marquand’s best books don’t fit into the modernist way of looking about literature, and that the gatekeepers of the 1930s and 1940s, when judging Marquand by these standards, conveniently labeled Apley has his best book because it had a form–Edith-Wharton-style satire–that they could handle.  In contrast, Point of No Return and all the other classics are a mixture of seriousness and satire that left critics uneasy.
 
Perhaps there’s a way to study this sort of thing more systematically?</p><p>2 0.67278993 <a title="119-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-01-References_on_predicting_elections.html">249 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-01-References on predicting elections</a></p>

I [Axelrod] am interested in building a model that predicts voting on the precinct level, using variables such as party registration, age, sex, income etc. Surely political scientists have worked on this problem.


I would be grateful for any reference you could provide in the way of articles and books.
  
My reply:  Political scientists have worked on this problem, and it’s easy enough to imagine hierarchical models of the sort discussed in my book with Jennifer. I can picture what I would do if asked to forecast at the precinct level, for example to model exit polls.  (In fact, I was briefly hired by the exit poll consortium in 2000 to do this, but then after I told them about hierarchical Bayes, they un-hired me!)  But I don’t actually know of any literature on precinct-level forecasting.  Perhaps one of you out there knows of some references?</p><p>3 0.6405527 <a title="119-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-22-Statistical_inference_based_on_the_minimum_description_length_principle.html">815 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-22-Statistical inference based on the minimum description length principle</a></p>

Here’s another query to add to the stats backlog…Minimum Description Length (MDL).  I’m  attaching  a 2002 Psych Rev paper on same.  Basically, it’s an approach to model selection that replaces goodness of fit with generalizability or complexity.


Would be great to get your response to this approach.
  
My reply:
 
I’ve heard about the minimum description length principle for a long time but have never really understood it.  So I have nothing to say!  Anyone who has anything useful to say on the topic, feel free to add in the comments.
 
The rest of you might wonder why I posted this.  I just thought it would be good for you to have some sense of the boundaries of my knowledge.</p><p>4 0.63189346 <a title="119-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian_inference_for_the_parameter_of_a_uniform_distribution.html">979 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian inference for the parameter of a uniform distribution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Subhash Lele writes:
  
I was wondering if you might know some good references to Bayesian treatment of parameter estimation for U(0,b) type distributions. I am looking for cases where the parameter is on the boundary. I would appreciate any help and advice you could provide. I am, in particular, looking for an MCMC (preferably in WinBUGS) based approach.  I figured out the WinBUGS part but I am still curious about the theoretical papers, asymptotics etc.
  
I actually can’t think of any examples!  But maybe you, the readers, can.
 
We also should think of the best way to implement this model in Stan.  We like to transform to avoid hard boundary constraints, but it seems a bit tacky to do a data-based transformation (which itself would not work if there are latent variables).
 
P.S.    I actually saw Lele speak at a statistics conference around 20 years ago.  There was a lively exchange between Lele and an older guy who was working on similar problems using a different method.

<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>6 0.62276691 <a title="119-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-25-Darn_that_Lindsey_Graham%21_%28or%2C_%E2%80%9CMr._P_Predicts_the_Kagan_vote%E2%80%9D%29.html">162 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-25-Darn that Lindsey Graham!

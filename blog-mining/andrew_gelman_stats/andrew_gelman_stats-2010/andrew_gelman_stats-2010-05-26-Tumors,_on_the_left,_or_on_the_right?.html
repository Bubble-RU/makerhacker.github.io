<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>4 0.72470248 <a title="53-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Massive_confusion_about_a_study_that_purports_to_show_that_exercise_may_increase_heart_risk.html">1364 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Massive confusion about a study that purports to show that exercise may increase heart risk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>6 0.7010864 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-Censoring_on_one_end%2C_%E2%80%9Coutliers%E2%80%9D_on_the_other%2C_what_can_we_do_with_the_middle%3F.html">791 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-Censoring on one end, “outliers” on the other, what can we do with the middle?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  blog  by J. Robert Lennon on abandoned novels made me think of the more general topic of abandoned projects.  I seem to recall George V. Higgins writing that he’d written and discarded 14 novels or so before publishing The Friends of Eddie Coyle.
 
I haven’t abandoned any novels but I’ve abandoned lots of research projects (and also have started various projects that there’s no way I’ll finish).  If you think about the decisions involved, it really has to be that way. You learn while you’re working on a project whether it’s worth continuing.  Sometimes I’ve put in the hard work and pushed a project to completion, published the article, and then I think . . . what was the point?  The modal number of citations of our articles is zero, etc.</p><p>2 0.92573619 <a title="53-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-27-Confusion_from_illusory_precision.html">1186 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-27-Confusion from illusory precision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.  I can’t believe anyone has such a precise estimate of the health effects of pesticides, and also I can’t believe anyone has such a precise effect of the health effect of eating an app</p><p>3 0.91700184 <a title="53-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-22-Top_10_blog_obsessions.html">920 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-22-Top 10 blog obsessions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about this because we seem to be circling around the same few topics over and over (while occasionally slipping in some new statistical ideas): 
   
10. Wegman 
9. Hipmunk 
8. Dennis the dentist 
7. Freakonomics 
6. The difference between significant and non-significant is not itself statistically significant 
5. Just use a hierarchical model already! 
4. Innumerate journalists who think that presidential elections are just like high school 
3. A graph can be pretty but convey essentially no information

<p>Introduction: In response to the post  The bane of many causes  in the context of mobile phone use and brain cancer,  Robert Erikson  wrote:
  

The true control here is the side of the head of the tumor: same side as phone use or opposite side.   If that is the test, the data from the study are scary.  Clearly tumors are more likely on the “same” side, at whatever astronomical p value you want to use.   That cannot be explained away by misremembering, since an auxiliary study showed misremembering was not biased toward cell phone-tumor consistency.

  
A strong signal in the data pointed by Prof. Erikson is that the tumors are overwhelmingly likelier to appear on the same side of the head as where the phone is held. I’ve converted the ratios into percentages, based on an assumption that the risk for tumors would be apriori equal for both sides of the head.
 
 
 
There is a group of people with low-to-moderate exposure and high lateral bias, but the bias does increase quite smoothly with increasing</p><p>5 0.89382738 <a title="53-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-10-My_talk_at_MIT_on_Thurs_11_Oct.html">1528 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-10-My talk at MIT on Thurs 11 Oct</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan: open-source Bayesian inference 
 
Speaker: Andrew Gelman, Columbia University 
Date: Thursday, October 11 2012 
Time: 4:00PM to 5:00PM 
Location: 32-D507 
Host: Polina Golland, CSAIL 
Contact: Polina Golland, 6172538005, polina@csail.mit.edu
 
Stan ( mc-stan.org ) is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We discuss how Stan works and what it can do, the problems that motivated us to write Stan, current challenges, and areas of planned development, including tools for improved generality and usability, more efficient sampling algorithms, and fuller integration of model building, model checking, and model understanding in Bayesian data analysis.

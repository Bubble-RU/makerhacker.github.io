[sent-16, score-0.419]
</p><p>2 Until the early 1990s, most pharmaceutical research on human subjects was conducted by physicians in universities and teaching hospitals. [sent-17, score-0.629]
</p><p>3 (The FDA, which must approve drugs before they can be marketed, doesn’t conduct clinical trials itself. [sent-18, score-0.805]
</p><p>4 ) However, pharmaceutical companies have been in search of cheaper, more efficient venues and today about 70 per cent of clinical trials take place in the private sector, often in the offices of private physicians or at dedicated sites. [sent-19, score-1.232]
</p><p>5 But the system has changed:    What does clinical research look like when everyone is in it for the money? [sent-25, score-0.419]
</p><p>6 A contract researcher does not come up with original ideas, or design research protocols, or analyse research results, or write them up for scientific publications. [sent-28, score-0.652]
</p><p>7 What a contract researcher does is recruit subjects, monitor their clinical care and sign off on the paperwork. [sent-30, score-0.749]
</p><p>8 It’s not at all clear to me that this doctor should be doing research; maybe he or she should be monitoring and taking care of the patients in the study. [sent-34, score-0.422]
</p><p>9 If the original research is being done at the lab, why not use on-site doctors who can focus on clinical care of the patients. [sent-36, score-0.778]
</p><p>10 Usually they will ‘come in on a daily basis, on most days, and they’ll sign off on all the things they need to sign off on, see any patients they need to see, and they’re gone’ . [sent-42, score-0.399]
</p><p>11 A part-time contract researcher conducting four or five clinical trials a year can earn an average of $300,000 in extra income. [sent-47, score-0.845]
</p><p>12 Even an ordinary office visit will be paid at twice the usual rate if the visit is part of a research study. [sent-51, score-0.396]
</p><p>13 Elliott writes:    Ready to recruit patients are sick people who can easily be persuaded to enrol in clinical trials, often because they are so poor that they have no better alternative. [sent-64, score-0.595]
</p><p>14 For years the demand for research subjects has been growing, driven not least by the sheer number of clinical trials being conducted in the desperate search for new blockbuster drugs. [sent-68, score-0.922]
</p><p>15 Many of these places have established a foothold in the industry as ‘rescue countries’: drug companies go there when they need data quickly – when their trials in the West have failed to show the drug is effective, for example . [sent-74, score-0.819]
</p><p>16 Until the mid-1970s, this usually meant prisoners; today the trials are done mainly on the poor, who sign up for the money. [sent-80, score-0.465]
</p><p>17 The most lucrative studies are longer trials testing the safety of new drugs, with lots of in-patient time and plenty of unpleasant medical procedures. [sent-89, score-0.495]
</p><p>18 If subjects are harmed by the drugs they take, they have no right to compensation, and they may well have to pay their own medical expenses. [sent-94, score-0.678]
</p><p>19 According to a survey published in the New England Journal of Medicine, only 16 per cent of the policies issued by academic health centres in the US offer free care to research subjects injured in trials. [sent-95, score-0.523]
</p><p>20 by enrolling in trials they can get drugs that they could not otherwise afford – never mind that the drugs are experimental, or may be placebos. [sent-100, score-0.885]

<p>Introduction: There is live debate that will available this week for those that might be interested.  The topic:  Can early stopped trials result in misleading results of systematic reviews?
  

 
It’s sponsored by the Cochrane Collaboration and although the level of discussion is often not very technical, it does in my opinion provide a nice window into clinical research and as Tukey might put it “the real uncertainties involved”. 
 
(As a disclaimer – I once assigned some reading from this group to my graduate students and they were embarrassed and annoyed at the awkward handling of even minor technical issues – but the statistical research community is not their target audience.)
 
I have a favourite in this debate, and a quick search on co-authors (not me) would likely tip that off to most members of this blog. 
 
Here’s the directions kindly supplied by Jonathan Sterne, who will be in the chair.

<p>Introduction: Sander Wagner writes:
  
I just read the post on ethical concerns in medical trials. As there seems to be a lot more pressure on private researchers i thought it might be a nice little exercise to compare p-values from privately funded medical trials with those reported from publicly funded research, to see if confirmation pressure is higher in private research (i.e. p-values are closer to the cutoff levels for significance for the privately funded research). Do you think this is a decent idea or are you sceptical? Also are you aware of any sources listing a large number of representative medical studies and their type of funding?
  
My reply:
 
This sounds like something worth studying.  I don’t know where to get data about this sort of thing, but now that it’s been blogged, maybe someone will follow up.</p><p>5 0.13921565 <a title="411-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-18-Continuing_efforts_to_justify_false_%E2%80%9Cdeath_panels%E2%80%9D_claim.html">284 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-18-Continuing efforts to justify false “death panels” claim</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan  gives the story .
 
Here’s Sarah Palin’s statement introducing the now-notorious phrase:
  
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s “death panel” so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.
  
And now Brendan:
  
Palin’s language suggests that a “death panel” would determine whether individual patients receive care based on their “level of productivity in society.” This was — and remains — false. Denying coverage at a system level for specific treatments or drugs is not equivalent to “decid[ing], based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society.’”
  
Seems like an open-and-shut case to me.  The “bureaucrats” (I think Palin is referring to “government employees”) are making decisions based on studies of the drug’s effectiveness:

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: Michael Gilligan, Eric Mvukiyehe, and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Gilligan, Mvukiyehe, and Samii] use original survey data, collected in Burundi in the summer of 2007, to show that a World Bank ex-combatant reintegration program implemented after Burundi’s civil war caused significant economic reintegration for its beneficiaries but that this economic reintegration did not translate into greater political and social reintegration.


Previous studies of reintegration programs have found them to be ineffective, but these studies have suffered from selection bias: only ex-combatants who self selected into those programs were studied. We avoid such bias with a quasi-experimental research design made possible by an exogenous bureaucratic failure in the implementation of program. One of the World Bank’s implementing partners delayed implementation by almost a year due to an unforeseen contract dispute. As a result, roughly a third of ex-combatants had their program benefits withheld for reas</p><p>4 0.96014422 <a title="411-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-23-Modeling_heterogenous_treatment_effects.html">2 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-23-Modeling heterogenous treatment effects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Don Green and Holger Kern write  on one of my  favorite topics , treatment interactions (see also  here ):
  
We [Green and Kern] present a methodology that largely automates the search for systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in large-scale experiments. We introduce a nonparametric estimator developed in statistical learning, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), to model treatment effects that vary as a function of covariates. BART has several advantages over commonly employed parametric modeling strategies, in particular its ability to automatically detect and model relevant treatment-covariate interactions in a flexible manner.


To increase the reliability and credibility of the resulting conditional treatment effect estimates, we suggest the use of a split sample design. The data are randomly divided into two equally-sized parts, with the first part used to explore treatment effect heterogeneity and the second part used to confirm the results. This approach permits a re</p><p>5 0.95428574 <a title="411-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-06-Quote_of_the_day.html">398 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-06-Quote of the day</a></p>

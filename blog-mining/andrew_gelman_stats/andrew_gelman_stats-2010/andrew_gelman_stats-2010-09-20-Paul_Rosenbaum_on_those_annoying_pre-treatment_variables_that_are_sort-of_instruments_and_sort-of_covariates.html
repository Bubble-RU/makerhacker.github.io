Matching is not an identification strategy a solution to your endogeneity problem; it is a weighting scheme. Saying matching will reduce endogeneity bias is like saying that the best way to get thin is to weigh yourself in kilos. The statement makes no sense. It confuses technique with substance. . . . When you run a regression, you control for the X you can observe. When you match, you are simply matching based on those same X. . . .
  
I see what Chris is getting at–matching, like regression, won’t help for the variables you’re not controlling for–but I disagree with his characterization of matching as a weighting scheme.  I see matching as a way to restrict your analysis to comparable cases.  The statistical motivation:  robustness.  If you had a good enough model, you wouldn’t neet to match, you’d just fit the model to the data.  But in common practice we often use simple regression models and so it can be helpful to do some matching first before regress</p><p>4 0.088982336 <a title="287-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-13-Personally%2C_I%E2%80%99d_rather_go_with_Teragram.html">2333 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-13-Personally, I’d rather go with Teragram</a></p>

We have been discussing the following two issues amongst ourselves, then with our methodological consultant for several days. However, we have not been able to arrive at a consensus. Consequently, we decided to seek an opinion from nationally known experts. FYI, we sent a similar inquiry to Larry Hedges and David Rogosa . . .  


1)      We are wondering if a post-hoc covariate adjustment is a good practice in the context of RCTs [randomized clinical trials]. We have a situation where we found a significant baseline difference between the treatment and the control groups in 3 variables. Some of us argue that adding those three variables to the original impact analysis model is a good idea, as that would remove the confound from the impact estimate. Others among us, on the other hand, argue that a post-hoc covariate adjustment should never be done, on the ground that those covariates are correlated with the treatment, which makes the analysis model that of quasi</p><p>6 0.08458668 <a title="287-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Matching_at_two_levels.html">213 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Matching at two levels</a></p>

I’ve been playing around with data from Coursera transaction logs, for an economics course and a modern poetry course so far.


For the Modern Poetry course, where there’s quite a bit of activity in the forums, the instructor (Al Filreis) is interested in what the factors are that lead to discussion threads being longer or shorter. For example, he wonders whether his own (fairly frequent) interventions have the effect of prolonging discussion or cutting it off.


Some background explorations are  here  with the relevant stuff mostly at the end, including  this .


With respect to Al’s specific question, my thought was to look at each of his comments, each one being the nth in some sequence, and to look at the empirical probability of continuing (at all, or perhaps for at least 1,2,3,… additional turns) in those cases c</p><p>3 0.7491405 <a title="287-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-18-Lack_of_complete_overlap.html">1017 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-18-Lack of complete overlap</a></p>

I have a question regarding a randomizing constraint in my current funded electricity experiment. 


After elimination of missing data we have 110 voluntary households from a larger population (resource constraints do not allow us to have more households!). I randomly assign them to threated and non treated where the treatment variable is some ICT that allows the treated to track their electricity consumption in real tim. The ICT is made of two devices, one that is plugged on the household’s modem and the other on the electric meter. A necessary condition for being treated is that the distance between the box and the meter be below some threshold (d), the value of which is 20 meters approximately. 


50 ICTs can be installed. 
60 households will be in the control group.


But, I can only assign 6 households in the control group for whom d is less than 20. Therefore, I have only 6 households in the control group who have a counterfactual in the group of treated.</p><p>4 0.73012125 <a title="287-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-11-Using_the_%E2%80%9Cinstrumental_variables%E2%80%9D_or_%E2%80%9Cpotential_outcomes%E2%80%9D_approach_to_clarify_causal_thinking.html">1492 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-11-Using the “instrumental variables” or “potential outcomes” approach to clarify causal thinking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.

Your blog has skirted around the value of observational studies and chided folks for using causal language when they only have associations but I sense that you ultimately find value in these associations. I would love for you to expand this thought in a blog. Specifically:


Does a measured association “suggest” a causal relationship? Are measured associations a good and efficient way to narrow the field of things that should be studied? Of all the things we should pursue, should we start with the stuff that has some largish measured association? Certainly many associations are not directly causal but due to joint association. Similarly, there must be many variables that are directly causally associated ( A -> B) but the effect, measured as an association, is masked by confounders. So if we took the “measured associations are worthwhile” approach, we’d never or rarely find the masked effects.

<p>Introduction: Last year  we discussed  an important challenge in causal inference:  The standard advice (given in many books, including ours) for causal inference is to control for relevant pre-treatment variables as much as possible.  But, as Judea Pearl has pointed out, instruments (as in “instrumental variables”) are pre-treatment variables that we would  not  want to “control for” in a matching or regression sense.
 
At first, this seems like a minor modification, with the new recommendation being to apply instrumental variables estimation using all pre-treatment instruments, and to control for all other pre-treatment variables.  But that can’t really work as general advice.  What about weak instruments or covariates that have some instrumental aspects?
 
I asked Paul Rosenbaum for his thoughts on the matter, and he wrote the following:
  
In section 18.2 of Design of Observational Studies (DOS), I [Rosenbaum] discuss “seemingly innocuous confounding” defined to be a covariate that predicts a su</p><p>2 0.90467989 <a title="287-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-29-Don%E2%80%99t_try_this_at_home.html">491 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-29-Don’t try this at home</a></p>

After seeing the statistics, I don’t see it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.  Some people have sent me some information showing serious problems with Unz’s methods</p><p>4 0.83908284 <a title="287-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-05-Someone_is_wrong_on_the_internet%2C_part_2.html">1563 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-05-Someone is wrong on the internet, part 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My coblogger John Sides  feeds  a troll.  It’s a tough call.  Yesterday I gave my  reasoning  for ignoring these provocateurs, but in this case the troll in question is writing for a major newspaper so it makes sense for John to go to the trouble of shooting him down.  Even though I suspect the columnist was trolling for no better reason than . . . he had a deadline and nothing to say so he thought he’d wade into a controversy.
 
On the plus side, as a statistician I’m happy that statistics is considered important enough that it’s worth trolling!  When they start attacking like this, they must feel a bit on the defensive. . . .</p><p>5 0.82301158 <a title="287-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-Kaiser_Fung_on_how_not_to_critique_models.html">1004 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-Kaiser Fung on how not to critique models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the context of a debate between economists Brad DeLong and Tyler Cowen on the “IS-LM model” [no, I don't know what it is, either!], Kaiser  writes :
  
Since a model is an abstraction, a simplification of reality, no model is above critique.


I [Kaiser] consider the following types of critique not deserving:


1) The critique that the modeler makes an assumption 
2) The critique that the modeler makes an assumption for mathematical convenience 
3) The critique that the model omits some feature 
4) The critique that the model doesn’t fit one’s intuition 
5) The critique that the model fails to make a specific prediction


Above all, a serious critique must include an alternative model that is provably better than the one it criticises. It is not enough to show that the alternative solves the problems being pointed out; the alternative must do so while preserving the useful aspects of the model being criticized.
  
I have mixed feelings about Kaiser’s rules.  On one hand, I agree wit</p><p>6 0.80837119 <a title="287-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-09-Blogging%2C_polemical_and_otherwise.html">1108 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-09-Blogging, polemical and otherwise</a></p>

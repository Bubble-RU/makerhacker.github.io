<p>Introduction: From 2008:
  
 The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds 


My favorite statistics demonstration is the one with the bag of candies. I’ve elaborated upon it since including it in  the Teaching Statistics book  and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.


 Preparation 


Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it’s exactly 100.


You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.


Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.

<p>Introduction: Joan Garfield, a leading researcher in statistics education, is conducting a survey of graduate students who teach or assist with the teaching of statistics.  She writes: 
  
  
We want to invite them to take a short survey that will enable us to collect some baseline data that we may use in a grant proposal we are developing.  The project would provide summer workshops and ongoing support for graduate students who will be teaching or assisting with teaching introductory statistics classes. If the grant is funded, we would invite up to 40 students from around the country who are entering graduate programs in statistics to participate in a three-year training and support program.  The goal of this program is to help these students become expert and flexible teachers of statistics, and to support them as they move through their teaching experiences as graduate students.
  
Here’s the  the online survey .  Garfield writes, “Your responses are completely voluntary and anonymous.

<p>Introduction: The commenting feature doesn’t work for me on Helen DeWitt’s blog so I’m forced to comment on her entries here.
 
1.  She  discusses  whether it’s fair to characterize  The Last Samurai .  I have a slightly different perspective on this:  I’ve never really understood the idea that a “beach read” should be something light and fluffy.  On the beach, you can relax, you have the time to get into anything.  I could see wanting something light on the subway–you have to be able to get into it right away and follow it amid all the jostles.  I guess the point is that when you’re at the beach, you’re far from the library.  So what you really want for the beach is not necessarily something relaxing or easy to read, but rather a  sure thing , a known quantity that you’ll definitely enjoy.  No point sitting on the beach reading a book that you hate.
 
2.  In an interesting  discussion  of translation, DeWitt recommends learning a language by reading great literature in the original tongue.

<p>Introduction: Early this afternoon I made the plan to teach a new course on sampling, maybe next spring, with the primary audience being political science Ph.D. students (although I hope to get students from statistics, sociology, and other departments).  Columbia already has a sampling course in the statistics department (which I taught for several years); this new course will be centered around political science questions.  Maybe the students can start by downloading data from the National Election Studies and General Social Survey and running some regressions, then we can back up and discuss what is needed to go further.
 
About an hour after discussing this new course with my colleagues, I (coincidentally) received the following email from Mike Alvarez:
  
If you were putting together a reading list on sampling for a grad course, what would you say are the essential readings?  I thought I’d ask you because I suspect you might have taught something along these lines.

The parenting club Bounty, which distributes their packs through midwives, hospitals, and large UK supermarket and pharmacy chains, commissioned a  fun little survey for Halloween from the company  OnePoll . Theme: Mothers as tricksters – tricking men into fathering their babies. You can find a full smackdown courtesy of UK-based sex educator and University College London psychologist Petra Boynton  here .
      
(One does wonder how a parenting club with such close links to the UK National Health Service thought a survey on this topic was at all appropriate, but that’s another rant.)


So far, so awful, but what I [Wolters] thought might grab your attention was the excuse OnePoll offered for their work in their email to Petra.

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J.

<p>Introduction: I keep hearing about textbook publishers who practically bribe instructors to assign their textbooks to students.  And then I received this (unsolicited) email:
  
 
You have recently been sent Pearson (Allyn & Bacon, Longman, Prentice Hall) texts to review for your summer and fall courses.  As a thank you for reviewing our texts, I would like to invite you to participate in a brief survey (attached).


If you have any questions about the survey, are not sure which books you have been sent, or if you would like to receive instructor’s materials, desk copies, etc. please let me know!  If you have recently received your course assignments – let me know as well .


Additionally, if you have decided to use a Pearson book in your summer or fall courses, I will provide you with an ISBN that will include discounts and resources for your students at no extra cost!


All you have to do is answer the 3 simple questions on the attached survey and you will receive a $10.00 Dunkin Donuts gift card.</p><p>2 0.86224496 <a title="78-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-16-%E2%80%9CGroundbreaking_or_Definitive%3F_Journals_Need_to_Pick_One%E2%80%9D.html">1122 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-16-“Groundbreaking or Definitive? Journals Need to Pick One”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  writes :
  
As long as a journal pursues a strategy of publishing “wow” studies, it will inevitably contain more unreplicable findings and unsupportable conclusions than equally rigorous but more “boring” journals. Groundbreaking will always be higher-risk. And definitive will be the territory of journals that publish meta-analyses and reviews. . . .


Most conclusions, even those in peer-reviewed papers in rigorous journals, should be regarded as tentative at best; but press releases and other public communication rarely convey that. . . .
  
His message to all of us:
  
Our standard response to a paper in Science, Nature, or Psychological Science should be “wow, that’ll be really interesting if it replicates.” And in our teaching and our engagement with the press and public, we need to make clear why that is the most enthusiastic response we can justify.</p><p>3 0.86065912 <a title="78-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-17-The_Washington_Post_reprints_university_press_releases_without_editing_them.html">2215 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-17-The Washington Post reprints university press releases without editing them</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .  But I wonder how the profs in the psych d</p><p>4 0.82912707 <a title="78-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Alfred_Kahn.html">487 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Alfred Kahn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Appointed “inflation czar” in late 1970s, Alfred Kahn is  most famous  for deregulating the airline industry.  At the time this seemed to make sense, although in retrospect I’m less a fan of consumer-driven policies than I used to be.  When I was a kid we subscribed to Consumer Reports and so I just assumed that everything that was good for the consumer–lower prices, better products, etc.–was a good thing.  Upon reflection, though, I think it’s a mistake to focus too narrowly on the interests of consumers.  For example (from  my Taleb review  a couple years ago):
  
The discussion on page 112 of how Ralph Nader saved lives (mostly via seat belts in cars) reminds me of his car-bumper campaign in the 1970s. My dad subscribed to Consumer Reports then (he still does, actually, and I think reads it for pleasure–it must be one of those Depression-mentality things), and at one point they were pushing heavily for the 5-mph bumpers. Apparently there was some federal regulation about how strong</p><p>5 0.81611466 <a title="78-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-14-Looking_at_many_comparisons_may_increase_the_risk_of_finding_something_statistically_significant_by_epidemiologists%2C_a_population_with_relatively_low_multilevel_modeling_consumption.html">1059 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-14-Looking at many comparisons may increase the risk of finding something statistically significant by epidemiologists, a population with relatively low multilevel modeling consumption</a></p>

 This  report claims that eating meat increases the risk of cancer.  I’m sure you can’t read the page but you probably can understand the graphs. Different bars represent subdivision in the amount of the particular type of meat one consumes. And each chunk is different types of meat. Left is for male right is for female.


They claim that the difference is significant, but they are clearly not!!


I’m for not eating much meat but this is just way too much…
  
Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
I don’t know what to think.  If you look carefully you can find one or two statistically significant differences but overall the pattern doesn’t look so compelling.  I don’t know what the top and bottom rows are, though.  Overall, the pattern in the top row looks like it could represent a real trend, while the graphs on the bottom row look like noise.
 
This could be a good example for our multiple comparisons paper.  If the researchers won’t</p><p>6 0.81255424 <a title="78-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-17-Subway_series.html">1810 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-17-Subway series</a></p>

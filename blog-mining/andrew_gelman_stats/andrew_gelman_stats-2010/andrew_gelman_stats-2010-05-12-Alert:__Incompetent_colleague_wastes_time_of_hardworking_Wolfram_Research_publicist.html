Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>Introduction: Yair points us to  this  page full of wonderful graphs from the Stephen Wolfram blog.  Here are a few:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized. But if we start looking at individuals, we’ll s</p><p>4 0.16768415 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-28-New_app_for_learning_intro_statistics.html">735 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-28-New app for learning intro statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carol Cronin writes:
  
The new Wolfram Statistics Course Assistant App, which was released today for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Optimized for mobile devices, the Wolfram Statistics Course Assistant App helps students understand concepts such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, probabilities, data points, random integers, random real numbers, and more.


To see some examples of how you and your readers can use the app, I’d like to encourage you to check out  this post  on the Wolfram|Alpha Blog.
  
If anybody out there with an i-phone etc. wants to try this out, please let me know how it works.  I’m always looking for statistics-learning tools for students.  I’m not really happy with the whole “mean, median, mode” thing (see above), but if the app has good things, then an instructor could pick and choose what to recommend, I assume.

<p>Introduction: Johnny Carson had this great trick where, after a joke bombed, he’d do such a good double-take that he’d end up getting a huge laugh.  This gimmick could never have worked as his sole shtick—at some point, Johnny had to tell some good jokes—but it was a reliable way to limit the downside.  For the purpose of our discussion here, the point is that, even when the joke failed, Carson had a way out.
 
I thought of this today after following a link from a commenter that led to  this blog  on publicity-minded author Tim Ferriss.  I’ve never read anything by Ferriss but I’ve read about him on occasion:  his gimmick is he promotes his book using ingenious marketing strategies.  Sort of like how Madonna is famous for being famous, and Paris Hilton is famous for being famous for being famous, Ferriss is famous for self-promotion.

<p>Introduction: Today’s item mixes two of my favorite themes in a horrible way, sort of like a Reese’s Cup but combining brussels sprouts and liver instead of peanut butter and chocolate.  In this case, the disturbing flavors that go together are  plagiarism  (you know what that is) and  the publication filter  (the  idea  that there should be very stringent standards for criticizing something, once it happens to be published somewhere).
 
 The copyist 
 
The first ingredient comes from Matthew Whitaker, an Arizona State University Foundation Professor of History who has a deplorable record of  copying material from other writers without attribution .
 
For convenience, I’ll  reproduce  an example here:
 
      
 
On the plus side; Whitaker removed the cliche’d phrase, “undisputed rulers of the roost” when copying from the online encyclopedia; on the downside, I don’t know what he was thinking when he rendered “Conservatives” with a capital letter.

<p>Introduction: “She was forty years old when she died.  It is possible that her art might have developed to include a wider area of human experience, just as possible that the chilling climate of the thirties might have withered it altogether.  But what she actually wrote was greatly talented.  She deserves a place, although obviously not a foremost one, in any literary history of the years between the wars.  The last letter she wrote, or rather dictated, to the printer of the Laforgue translations shows the invariable fastidiousness of her talent, a fastidiousness which is often infuriating but just as often impressive, and is in any case rare enough to be worth remembrance:

<p>Introduction: 1.
 
We Bayesian statisticians like to say there are three kinds of statisticians:
 
a.  Bayesians; 
b.  People who are Bayesians but don’t realize it (that is, they act in coherence with some unstated probability); 
c.  Failed Bayesians (that is, people whose inference could be improved by some attention to coherence).
 
So, if a statistician does great work, we are inclined to claim this person for the Bayesian cause, even if he or she vehemently denies any Bayesian leanings.

In his autobiography, Bertrand Russell tells the story of when he went to prison for opposing World War 1:
  
I [Russell] was much cheered on my arrival by the warden at the gate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion, and I replied ‘agnostic.’ He asked how to spell it, and remarked with a sigh: “Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.” This remark kept me cheerful for about a week.

<p>Introduction: Mark Weisbrot points me to  this report  trashing a recent OAS report on Haiti’s elections.  Weisbrot writes:
  
The two simplest things that are wrong with the OAS analysis are: (1)  By looking only at a sample of the tally sheets and not using any statistical test, they have no idea how many other tally sheets would also be thrown out by the same criteria that they used, and how that would change the result  and (2)  The missing/quarantined tally sheets are much greater in number than the ones that they threw out; our analysis indicates that if these votes had been counted, the result would go the other way.
  
I have not had a chance to take a look at this myself but I’m posting it here so that experts on election irregularities can see this and give their judgments.
 
P.S.  Weisbrot updates:
  
 
We [Weisbrot et al.] published our actual paper on the OAS Mission’s Report today.

<p>Introduction: Marty McKee at Wolfram Research appears to have a very very stupid colleague.  McKee  wrote  to Christian Robert:
  
Your article, “Evidence and Evolution: A review”, caught the attention of one of my colleagues, who thought that it could be developed into an interesting Demonstration to add to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.
  
As Christian points out, adapting his book review into a computer demonstration would be quite a feat!  I wonder what McKee’s colleague could be thinking?  I recommend that Wolfram fire McKee’s colleague immediately:  what an idiot!
 
P.S.  I’m not actually sure that McKee was the author of this email; I’m guessing this was the case because this other  very similar  email was written under his name.
 
P.P.S.  To head off the inevitable comments:  Yes, yes, I know this is no big deal and I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it.  But . . . Wolfram Research has contributed such great things to the world, that I hate to think of them wasting any money paying</p><p>6 0.79369104 <a title="28-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-17-Excel-bashing.html">1808 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-17-Excel-bashing</a></p>

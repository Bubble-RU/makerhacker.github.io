<p>Introduction: A friend writes to me:
  
You will be amused to know that students in our Bayesian Inference paper at 4th year found solutions to exercises from your book on-line.  The amazing thing was that some of them were dumb enough to copy out solutions verbatim.   However, I thought you might like to know you have done well in this class!
  
Iâ&euro;&trade;m happy to hear this.  I worked hard on those solutions!</p><p>3 0.27455658 <a title="42-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-19-Sorry%2C_no_ARM_solutions.html">1220 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-19-Sorry, no ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Gerlanc asks:
  
I’ve been reading your Regression and Multilevel Modeling book. Do you have a set of example solutions for the problems in the book?
  
Henning Piezunka, Adam Lynton, and others have asked the same question.
 
My universal response:
 
I’m glad you like our book.  Unfortunately, we have no solution sets.  I made a bunch of solutions for my earlier book but it was so much work that I decided not to do it a second time!</p><p>4 0.25038779 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-ARM_solutions.html">240 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>5 0.19164307 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-19-Updated_R_code_and_data_for_ARM.html">41 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-19-Updated R code and data for ARM</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>5 0.63270569 <a title="42-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-05-A_locally_organized_online_BDA_course_on_G%2B_hangout%3F.html">2009 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-05-A locally organized online BDA course on G+ hangout?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eoin Lawless wrote me:
  
I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.


My question: you are obviously evangelical about the benefits that Bayesian statistics brings, have you ever considered producing a Coursera (or similar) cour</p><p>6 0.6293065 <a title="42-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-24-Bayesian_quality_control%3F.html">1912 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-24-Bayesian quality control?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are  solutions to about 50 of the exercises from Bayesian Data Analysis.  The solutions themselves haven’t been updated; I just cleaned up the file:  some change in Latex had resulted in much of the computer code running off the page, so I went in and cleaned up the files.
 
I wrote most of these in 1996, and I like them a lot.  I think several of them would’ve made good journal articles, and in retrospect I wish I’d published them as such.  Original material that appears first in a book (or, even worse, in homework solutions) can easily be overlooked.</p><p>2 0.90345395 <a title="42-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-25-The_harm_done_by_tests_of_significance.html">1776 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-25-The harm done by tests of significance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After seeing  this recent discussion , Ezra Hauer sent along  an article of his  from the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention, describing three examples from accident research in which null hypothesis significance testing led researchers astray.  Hauer writes:
  
The problem is clear. Researchers obtain real data which, while noisy, time and again point in a certain direction. However, instead of saying: “here is my estimate of the safety effect, here is its precision, and this is how what I found relates to previous findings”, the data is processed by NHST, and the researcher says, correctly but pointlessly: “I cannot be sure that the safety effect is not zero”. Occasionally, the researcher adds, this time incorrectly and unjustifiably, a statement to the effect that: “since the result is not statistically significant, it is best to assume the safety effect to be zero”. In this manner, good data are drained of real content, the direction of empirical conclusions reversed, and ord</p><p>3 0.9010129 <a title="42-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism_as_a_form_of_voluntarism.html">482 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism as a form of voluntarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  by Alex Tabarrok (following up on an article by Rebecca Solnit) on the continuum between voluntarism (or, more generally, non-cash transactions) and markets with monetary exchange.  I just have a few comments of my own:
 
1.  Solnit writes of “the iceberg economy,” which she characterizes as “based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return . . . the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit.”  I just wonder whether “barter” completely fits in here.  Maybe it depends on context.  Sometimes barter is an informal way of keeping track (you help me and I help you), but in settings of low liquidity I could imagine barter being simply an inefficient way of performing an economic transaction.
 
2.  I am no expert on capitalism but my impression is that it’s not just about “competition and selfishness” but also is related to the</p><p>4 0.89973879 <a title="42-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-04-Wanna_be_the_next_Tyler_Cowen%3F__It%E2%80%99s_not_as_easy_as_you_might_think%21.html">1787 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-04-Wanna be the next Tyler Cowen?

<p>Introduction: I continue to be the go-to guy for bad graphs.  Today (i.e., 22 Feb), I received an email from Gary Rosin:
  
I [Rosin] thought you might be interested in  this  graph showing the decline in median prices of homes since 1997. It exaggerates the  proportions by using $150,000 as the floor, rather than zero.
  
Indeed.  Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
A line plot, rather than a bar plot, would be appropriate here.  Also, it’s weird that the headline says “10 years” but the graph has only 6 years.  Why not give some perspective and show, say, 30 years?</p><p>6 0.89457309 <a title="42-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-03-An_argument_that_can%E2%80%99t_possibly_make_sense.html">743 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-03-An argument that can’t possibly make sense</a></p>

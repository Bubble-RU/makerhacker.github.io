<p>Introduction: With the completion of the last edition of Jose Bernardo’s Valencia (Spain) conference on Bayesian statistics–I didn’t attend, but many of my  friends  were there–I thought I’d share my strongest memory of the Valencia conference that I attended in 1991.  I contributed a poster and a discussion, both on the topic of inference from iterative simulation, but what I remember most vividly, and what bothered me the most, was how little interest there was in checking model fit.  Not only had people mostly not checked the fit of their models to data, and not only did they seem uninterested in such checks, even worse was that many of these Bayesians felt that it was basically illegal to check model fit.
 
I don’t want to get too down on Bayesians for this.  Lots of non-Bayesian statisticians go around not checking their models too.  With Bayes, though, model checking seems particularly important because Bayesians rely on their models so strongly, not just as a way of getting point estimates bu</p><p>5 0.10452613 <a title="453-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-18-Subtle_statistical_issues_to_be_debated_on_TV..html">350 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-18-Subtle statistical issues to be debated on TV.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There is live debate that will available this week for those that might be interested.  The topic:  Can early stopped trials result in misleading results of systematic reviews?
  

 
It’s sponsored by the Cochrane Collaboration and although the level of discussion is often not very technical, it does in my opinion provide a nice window into clinical research and as Tukey might put it “the real uncertainties involved”. 
 
(As a disclaimer – I once assigned some reading from this group to my graduate students and they were embarrassed and annoyed at the awkward handling of even minor technical issues – but the statistical research community is not their target audience.)
 
I have a favourite in this debate, and a quick search on co-authors (not me) would likely tip that off to most members of this blog. 
 
Here’s the directions kindly supplied by Jonathan Sterne, who will be in the chair.

<p>Introduction: Joel Greenhouse writes:
  
I saw your recent paper on Feller [see  here  and, for a more fanciful theory,  here ].  Looks like it was fun to write.  I recently wrote  a paper  that asks an orthogonal question to yours.  Why during the 1950-1960′s did Jerry Cornfield become a Bayesian?   It appeared in Statistics in Medicine –  “On becoming a Bayesian: Early correspondences between J. Cornfield and L. J. Savage.”
  
In his paper, Greenhouse writes:
  
Jerome Cornfield was arguably the leading proponent for the use of Bayesian methods in biostatistics during the 1960s. Prior to 1963, however, Cornfield had no publications in the area of Bayesian statistics. At a time when frequentist methods were the dominant influence on statistical practice, Cornfield went against the mainstream and embraced Bayes. . . . Cornfield’s interest in Bayesian methods began prior to 1961 and that the clarity of his Bayesian outlook began to take shape following Birnbaum’s ASA paper on the likelihood prin- cip</p><p>3 0.69820017 <a title="453-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-11-How_things_sound_to_us%2C_versus_how_they_sound_to_others.html">1259 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-11-How things sound to us, versus how they sound to others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:
  
Research, however, is not a matter of faith but a matter of arguments, which should always be evaluated with the utmost intellec</p><p>4 0.68326461 <a title="453-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-04-Generalized_Method_of_Moments%2C_whatever_that_is.html">449 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-04-Generalized Method of Moments, whatever that is</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xuequn Hu writes:
  
I am an econ doctoral student, trying to do some empirical work using Bayesian methods.  Recently I read a paper(and its discussion) that pitches Bayesian methods against GMM (Generalized Method of Moments), which is quite popular in econometrics for frequentists. I am wondering if you can, here or on your blog, give some insights about these two methods, from the perspective of a Bayesian statistician. I know GMM does not conform to likelihood principle, but Bayesian are often charged with strong distribution assumptions.  
  
I can’t actually help on this, since I don’t know what GMM is.  My guess is that, like other methods that don’t explicitly use prior estimation, this method will work well if sufficient information is included as data.  Which would imply a hierarchical structure.</p><p>5 0.67685193 <a title="453-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-Articles_on_the_philosophy_of_Bayesian_statistics_by_Cox%2C_Mayo%2C_Senn%2C_and_others%21.html">932 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-Articles on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics by Cox, Mayo, Senn, and others!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This conference touches nicely on many of the more Biostatistics related topics that have come up on this blog from a pragmatic and perceptive Bayesian perspective.
 
 Fourth Annual Bayesian Biostatistics Conference 
 
Including the star of that recent Cochrane TV debate who will be the key note speaker. 
 
See here  Subtle statistical issues to be debated on TV.  and perhaps the last comment which is my personal take on that debate.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>3 0.80221701 <a title="453-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-Statistical_fact_checking_needed%2C_or%2C_No%2C_Ronald_Reagan_did_not_win_%E2%80%9Coverwhelming_support_from_evangelicals%E2%80%9D.html">143 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-Statistical fact checking needed, or, No, Ronald Reagan did not win “overwhelming support from evangelicals”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>4 0.79386491 <a title="453-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>5 0.76987082 <a title="453-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project_qualifying_exam_process%3A__An_intensified_dialogue_between_students_and_faculty.html">308 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project qualifying exam process:  An intensified dialogue between students and faculty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>6 0.76834112 <a title="453-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-09-Experimental_work_on_market-based_or_non-market-based_incentives.html">1410 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-09-Experimental work on market-based or non-market-based incentives</a></p>

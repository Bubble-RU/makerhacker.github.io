<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
Texas has begun to enforce [a law regarding parallel parking] only recently . . . Up until now, of course, there has been strong net mobility into the state of Texas, so was the previous lack of enforcement so bad?
  
I care not at all about the direction in which people park their cars and I have no opinion on this law, but I have to raise an alarm at Cowen’s argument here.
 
Let me strip it down to its basic form:
 
1.  Until recently, state X had policy A.
 
2.  Up until now, there has been strong net mobility into state X
 
3.  Therefore, the presumption is that policy A is ok.
 
In this particular case, I think we can safely assume that parallel parking regulations have had close to zero impact on the population flows into and out of Texas.  More generally, I think logicians could poke some holes into the argument that 1 and 2 above imply 3.  For one thing, you could apply this argument to  any  policy in any state that’s had positive net migration.

Presumably diplomats either enjoy serving their country or they enjoy the ego rents of being a diplomat or both.  It is a false feeling of power, borrowed power from one’s country of origin rather than from one’s personal achievements.
  
Huh?  I’d hardly think this needs to be explained, but here goes:
  

 
1.  Diplomats may feel the  duty  to serve their country, which is not the same as “enjoying” it.  Sometimes people take on jobs that are challenging and not well-paid because they feel that it is their duty to do their best at it.
 
2.  Some diplomats are very accomplished individuals, and that is why they are chosen to represent their country.  Consider an analogy:  Yes, Tyler Cowen borrows some power from George Mason University.  But it goes the other way too:  GMU borrows power from TC.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>6 0.74237972 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-Do_you_own_anything_that_was_manufactured_in_the_1950s_and_still_is_in_regular%2C_active_use_in_your_life%3F.html">387 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-Do you own anything that was manufactured in the 1950s and still is in regular, active use in your life?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  hypothesizes  a “dogmatism portfolio” or a “quota of dogmatism”:  in his words,
  
If you’re very dogmatic in one area, you may be less dogmatic in others.
  
OK, well “may be” is pretty vague.  There’s not really anything to disagree with, yet.  But then Cowen continues:
  
 
There’s a lesson here.  If you wish to be a more open-minded thinker, adhere to some extreme and perhaps unreasonable fandoms, the more firmly believed the better and the more obscure the area the better.  This will help fulfill your dogmatism quota, yet without much skewing your more important beliefs.
 

 
He seems to be making a testable prediction here, that levels of dogmatism on two randomly chosen issues should be negatively correlated.  I guess I should call this “almost testable,” as it still requires an issue-by-issue measure of dogmatism.  (Is it dogmatic to believe that there was this guy called Jesus who walked on water . . . or is it dogmatic to say that Jesus  didn’t  walk on water and</p><p>2 0.80549467 <a title="121-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-21-Red_state_blue_state%2C_or%2C_states_and_counties_are_not_persons.html">1587 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-21-Red state blue state, or, states and counties are not persons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to  this  news article by Lauren Sandler:
  
Stunningly, the postponement of marriage and parenting — the factors that shrink the birth rate — is the very best predictor of a person’s politics in the United States, over even income and education levels, a Belgian demographer named Ron Lesthaeghe [and coauthor Lisa Neidert]  has discovered . Larger family size in America correlates to early marriage and childbirth, lower women’s employment, and opposition to gay rights — all social factors that lead voters to see red.
  
All the analysis in the linked paper is at the state and county level.  That’s fine but this is not going to tell you what is a “predictor of a person’s politics.”  Cowen labels his post “Sentences to ponder,” and what I want to ponder is that people are so quick to jump from aggregate to individual patterns.
 
And, yes, I know that aggregate patterns are related to individual patterns but they’re not the same.   In particular, from the evidence we’</p><p>3 0.80436051 <a title="121-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-04-Graphical_insights_into_the_safety_of_cycling..html">646 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-04-Graphical insights into the safety of cycling.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?  Obviously, if peo</p><p>4 0.80225199 <a title="121-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-30-Strings_Attached%3A_Untangling_the_Ethics_of_Incentives.html">1093 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-30-Strings Attached: Untangling the Ethics of Incentives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Paulse points me to  this book  by Ruth Grant:
  
Incentives can be found everywhere–in schools, businesses, factories, and government–influencing people’s choices about almost everything, from financial decisions and tobacco use to exercise and child rearing. So long as people have a choice, incentives seem innocuous. But Strings Attached demonstrates that when incentives are viewed as a kind of power rather than as a form of exchange, many ethical questions arise: How do incentives affect character and institutional culture? Can incentives be manipulative or exploitative, even if people are free to refuse them? What are the responsibilities of the powerful in using incentives? Ruth Grant shows that, like all other forms of power, incentives can be subject to abuse, and she identifies their legitimate and illegitimate uses.


Grant offers a history of the growth of incentives in early twentieth-century America, identifies standards for judging incentives, and examines incentives</p><p>5 0.79042912 <a title="121-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-05-Those_darn_conservative_egalitarians.html">1444 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-05-Those darn conservative egalitarians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nadia Hassan writes:
  
In your  review  of the Jacobs and Page book, you argued that while there was an open question of whether government could give voters what they wanted in light of the tax increases they might accept, Jacobs and Page were pretty persuasive about targeted tax hikes and specific programs especially against the freeloader view.  Recent discussions, and some focus groups  bear out these points exactly.

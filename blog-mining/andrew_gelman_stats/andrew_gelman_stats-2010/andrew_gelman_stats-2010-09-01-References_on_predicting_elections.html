I’m working at a non-profit organization called CRRC in the Republic of Georgia.
      
I’m having a methodological problem and I saw the syllabus for your sampling class online and thought I might be able to ask you about it?


We do a lot of complex surveys nationwide; our typical sample design is as follows:


- stratify by rural/urban/capital 
- sub-stratify the rural and urban strata into NE/NW/SE/SW geographic quadrants 
- select voting precincts as PSUs 
- select households as SSUs 
- select individual respondents as TSUs


I’m relatively new here, and past practice has been to sample voting precincts with probability proportional to size.  It’s desirable because it’s not logistically feasible for us to vary the number of interviews per precinct with precinct size, so it makes the selection probabilities for households more even across precinct sizes. However, I have a complex sampling textbook (Lohr 1999), and it explains how complex it is to calculate sel</p><p>3 0.10292824 <a title="249-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-20-Displaying_inferences_from_complex_models.html">1815 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-20-Displaying inferences from complex models</a></p>

I am completing my doctoral dissertation dealing with modeling adverse birth outcomes.  The models are complex with 9 risk factors, 5 area level variables and 4 individual level variables.


I used hierarchical logistic regression (SAS glimmix) to analyze the data.


I am now faced with reporting the results.  Can you please recommend any references and/or examples that would suggest what results to report in what format?  I have found no references and scant examples of reporting such results in tables.

<p>Introduction: In a link to our  back-and-forth  on causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings, Elias Bareinboim (a computer scientist who is working with Judea Pearl)  writes :
  
In the past week, I have been engaged in a discussion with Andrew Gelman and his blog readers regarding causal inference, selection bias, confounding, and generalizability. I was trying to understand how his method which he calls “hierarchical modeling” would handle these issues and what guarantees it provides. . . . If anyone understands how “hierarchical modeling” can solve a simple toy problem (e.g., M-bias, control of confounding, mediation, generalizability), please share with us.
  
In his post, Bareinboim raises a direct question about hierarchical modeling and also indirectly brings up larger questions about what is convincing evidence when evaluating a statistical method.  As I wrote earlier, Bareinboim believes that “The only way investigators can decide w</p><p>5 0.097956806 <a title="249-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-06-17_groups%2C_6_group-level_predictors%3A__What_to_do%3F.html">1248 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-06-17 groups, 6 group-level predictors:  What to do?</a></p>

I am using a multilevel model with three levels. I read that you wrote a book about multilevel models, and wonder if you can solve the following question.  


The data structure is like this:

I use 6 level-three variables (i.e. industry characteristics) to explain the variance of the level-one effect across industries.

My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.

<p>Introduction: A colleague emailed me with a question about the methods used by  Groseclose and Milyo  in their study of media bias.
 
Before getting to the question, I just wanted to comment that Groseclose has had really bad timing with this project.
 
First off, his article came out in 2005 when everybody was hating Bush.  Even the Republicans who reelected him weren’t thrilled with the guy.  Then his book came out in 2011.  If his book had come out a year ago, that would’ve been perfect:  the 2010 elections coming up, lots of anger at the Democrats and Obama, no peer-reviewed criticisms of his work, etc.  Instead he waited until 2011, and then look what he got:
 
- Republicans feel they have a chance at winning in 2012 so they’re more interested in fighting and less interested in complaining.
 
- John Gasper  shoots down  Groseclose/Milyo in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science.  That’s gotta hurt.

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest.

<p>Introduction: Reading somebody else’s statistics rant made me realize the inherent contradictions in much of my own statistical advice.
  

 
Jeff Lax sent along  this article  by Philip Schrodt, along with the cryptic comment:
  
Perhaps of interest to you. perhaps not.  Not meant to be an excuse for you to rant against hypothesis testing again.
  
In his article, Schrodt makes a reasonable and entertaining argument against the overfitting of data and the overuse of linear models.  He states that his article is motivated by the quantitative papers he has been sent to review for journals or conferences, and he explicitly excludes “studies of United States voting behavior,” so at least I think Mister P is off the hook.
 
I notice a bit of incoherence in Schrodt’s position–on one hand, he criticizes “kitchen-sink models” for overfitting and he criticizes “using complex methods without understanding the underlying assumptions” . . . but then later on he suggests that political scientists in this countr</p><p>6 0.65346086 <a title="249-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel_modeling_and_instrumental_variables.html">1468 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel modeling and instrumental variables</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A  comment  by Mark Palko reminded me that, while I’m a huge  Marquand  fan, I think The Late George Apley is way overrated.  My theory is that Marquand’s best books don’t fit into the modernist way of looking about literature, and that the gatekeepers of the 1930s and 1940s, when judging Marquand by these standards, conveniently labeled Apley has his best book because it had a form–Edith-Wharton-style satire–that they could handle.  In contrast, Point of No Return and all the other classics are a mixture of seriousness and satire that left critics uneasy.
 
Perhaps there’s a way to study this sort of thing more systematically?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88683057 <a title="249-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-01-References_on_predicting_elections.html">249 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-01-References on predicting elections</a></p>

I [Axelrod] am interested in building a model that predicts voting on the precinct level, using variables such as party registration, age, sex, income etc. Surely political scientists have worked on this problem.


I would be grateful for any reference you could provide in the way of articles and books.
  
My reply:  Political scientists have worked on this problem, and it’s easy enough to imagine hierarchical models of the sort discussed in my book with Jennifer. I can picture what I would do if asked to forecast at the precinct level, for example to model exit polls.  (In fact, I was briefly hired by the exit poll consortium in 2000 to do this, but then after I told them about hierarchical Bayes, they un-hired me!)  But I don’t actually know of any literature on precinct-level forecasting.  Perhaps one of you out there knows of some references?</p><p>3 0.84609294 <a title="249-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-25-The_problem_with_realistic_advice%3F.html">1428 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-25-The problem with realistic advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>4 0.83800095 <a title="249-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-25-Darn_that_Lindsey_Graham%21_%28or%2C_%E2%80%9CMr._P_Predicts_the_Kagan_vote%E2%80%9D%29.html">162 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-25-Darn that Lindsey Graham! (or, “Mr. P Predicts the Kagan vote”)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the basis of two papers and because it is completely obvious, we (meaning  me , Justin, and  John ) predict that Elena Kagan will get confirmed to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  But we also want to see how close we can come to predicting the votes for and against.
 
We actually have two sets of predictions, both using the MRP technique discussed previously on this blog.  The first is based on our  recent paper  in the  Journal of Politics  showing that support for the nominee in a senator’s home state plays a striking role in whether she or he votes to confirm the nominee.  The second is based on a  new working paper  extending “basic” MRP to show that senators respond far more to their co-partisans than the median voter in their home states.  Usually, our vote “predictions” do not differ much, but there is a group of senators who are predicted to vote yes for Kagan with a probability around 50% and the two sets of predictions thus differ for Kagan more than usual.</p><p>5 0.82967907 <a title="249-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian_inference_for_the_parameter_of_a_uniform_distribution.html">979 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian inference for the parameter of a uniform distribution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Subhash Lele writes:
  
I was wondering if you might know some good references to Bayesian treatment of parameter estimation for U(0,b) type distributions. I am looking for cases where the parameter is on the boundary. I would appreciate any help and advice you could provide. I am, in particular, looking for an MCMC (preferably in WinBUGS) based approach.  I figured out the WinBUGS part but I am still curious about the theoretical papers, asymptotics etc.
  
I actually can’t think of any examples!  But maybe you, the readers, can.
 
We also should think of the best way to implement this model in Stan.  We like to transform to avoid hard boundary constraints, but it seems a bit tacky to do a data-based transformation (which itself would not work if there are latent variables).
 
P.S.    I actually saw Lele speak at a statistics conference around 20 years ago.  There was a lively exchange between Lele and an older guy who was working on similar problems using a different method.

My research group is increasingly focusing on a series of problems that involve data that either have missingness or measurements that may have bias/error.  We have at times developed our own approaches to imputation (as simple as interpolating a missing unit and as sophisticated as a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model) and at other times, other groups impute the data. 


The outputs are being used to investigate the basic associations between pairs of variables, Xs and Ys, in regressions; we may or may not interpret these as causal.  I am contacting colleagues with relevant expertise to suggest good references on whether having imputed X and/or Y in a subsequent regression is correct or if it could somehow lead to biased/spurious associations.   Thinking about this, we can have at least the following situations (these could all be Bayesian or not):

The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>4 0.11489321 <a title="404-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-12-Single_or_multiple_imputation%3F.html">608 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-12-Single or multiple imputation?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights.

I have questions regarding one technique you and your colleagues described in your papers: the cross validation (Multiple Imputation with Diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening Windows into the Black Box, with reference to Gelman, King, and Liu, 1998). I think this is the technique I need for my purpose, but I am not sure I understand it right. I want to use the multiple imputation to estimate the outcome of psychotherapies based on longitudinal data. First I have to demonstrate that I am able to get unbiased estimates with the multiple imputation. The expected bias is the overestimation of the outcome of dropouts.


I will test my imputation strategies by means of a series of simulations (delete values, impute, compare with the original). Due to the complexity of the statistical analyses I think I need at least 200 cases. Now I don’t have so many cases without any missings. My data have missing values in different variables.

Given your ongoing discussion of info viz for different goals, you might be interested in Sinan Aral’s  new article :


This touches on several info viz themes: 
- Viz for yourself (or your team) vs. visualizations to share the final conclusions 
- Viz for identifying promising features for use in modeling 
- Viz and statistical significance, especially when the data has plenty of dependence structure


Also, these cascade visualizations are perhaps worth comparing with some of  very large cascades  on Facebook made by my colleagues Alex Dow, Lada Adamic, and Adrien Friggeri.
  
I like those graphs but on the international maps I would make the country boundaries thinner and I would get rid of Greenland and Antarctica, they’re distracting.

About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>6 0.6794036 <a title="404-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-20-Cars_vs._trucks.html">527 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-20-Cars vs. trucks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When I first saw this graphic, I thought “boy, that’s great, sometimes the graphic practically makes itself.” Normally it’s hard to use lots of different colors to differentiate items of interest, because there’s usually not an intuitive mapping between color and item (e.g. for countries, or states, or whatever). But the colors of crayons, what could be more perfect? So this graphic seemed awesome. But, as they discovered after some experimentation at  datapointed.net  there is an even BETTER possibility here. Click the link to see.

<p>Introduction: Now here’s a foundation I (Bob) can get behind: 
  

 Foundation for Open Access Statistics  (FOAS)

  
Their  mission  is to “promote free software, open access publishing, and reproducible research in statistics.”  To me, that’s like supporting  motherhood and apple pie !
 
FOAS spun out of and is partially designed to support the   Journal of Statistical Software   (aka  JSS , aka  JStatSoft ). I adore  JSS  because it (a) is open access, (b) publishes systems papers on statistical software, (c) has fast reviewing turnaround times, and (d) is free for authors and readers.  One of the next items on my to-do list is to write up the  Stan  modeling language and submit it to  JSS .
 
As a not-for-profit with no visible source of income, they are quite sensibly  asking for donations  (don’t complain — it beats $3K author fees or not being able to read papers).</p><p>same-blog 4 0.91592985 <a title="404-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-09-%E2%80%9CMuch_of_the_recent_reported_drop_in_interstate_migration_is_a_statistical_artifact%E2%80%9D.html">404 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-09-“Much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Greg Kaplan writes:
  
I noticed that you have blogged a little about interstate migration trends in the US, and thought  that you might be interested in  a new working paper  of mine (joint with Sam Schulhofer-Wohl from the Minneapolis Fed) which I have attached.


Briefly, we show that much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact: The Census Bureau made an undocumented change in its imputation procedures for missing data in 2006, and this change significantly reduced the number of imputed interstate moves. The change in imputation procedures — not any actual change in migration behavior — explains 90 percent of the reported decrease in interstate migration between the 2005 and 2006 Current Population Surveys, and 42 percent of the decrease between 2000 and 2010.

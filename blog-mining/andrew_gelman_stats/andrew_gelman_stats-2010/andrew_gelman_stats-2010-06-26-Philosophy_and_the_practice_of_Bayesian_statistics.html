A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.

<p>Introduction: In  my remarks  on Arrow’s theorem (the weak form of Arrow’s Theorem is that any result can be published no more than five times. The strong form is that every result will be published five times), I meant no criticism of Bruno Frey, the author of the articles in question:  I agree that it can be a contribution to publish in multiple places.  Regarding the evaluation of contributions, it should be possible to evaluate research contributions and also evaluate communication.  One problem is that communication is both under- and over-counted.  It’s undercounted in that we mostly get credit for original ideas not for exposition; it’s overcounted in that we need communication skills to publish in the top journals.  But I don’t think these two biases cancel out.

<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.  It’s just that he’s fighting against a bu</p><p>5 0.8764022 <a title="110-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics_%28with_all_the_discussions%21%29.html">1712 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (with all the discussions!)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  comments on  the (presumably) well-intentioned but silly  Jumpstart test of financial literacy , which was given to 7000 high school seniors  Given that, as we heard a few years back, most high school seniors can’t locate Miami on a map of the U.S., you won’t be surprised to hear that they flubbed item after item on this quiz.
 
But, as Palko points out, the concept is better than the execution:
  
 
With the complex, unstable economy, the shift away from traditional pensions and the constant flood of new financial products, financial literacy might be more important now than it has been for decades. You could even make the case for financial illiteracy being a major cause of the economic crisis.


But if the supporters of financial literacy need a good measure of how well we’re doing, they’ll need to find a better instrument than the Jump$tart survey.


The ‘test’ part of the survey consists of thirty-one questions. That’s not very long but that many questions should be su</p><p>2 0.97664797 <a title="110-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-20-The_AAA_Tranche_of_Subprime_Science.html">2179 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-20-The AAA Tranche of Subprime Science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  our new ethics column for Chance , Eric Loken and I write about our current favorite topic:
  
One of our ongoing themes when discussing scientific ethics is the central role of statistics in recognizing and communicating uncer- 
tainty. Unfortunately, statistics—and the scientific process more generally—often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. . . .


We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages—that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty—were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a</p><p>3 0.97273362 <a title="110-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-17-Replication_backlash.html">2137 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-17-Replication backlash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Raghuveer Parthasarathy pointed me to an article in Nature by Mina Bissell, who  writes , “The push to replicate findings could shelve promising research and unfairly damage the reputations of careful, meticulous scientists.”
 
I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

<p>Introduction: After I gave  my talk  at an econ seminar on Why We (Usually) Don’t Care About Multiple Comparisons, I got the following comment:
  
One question that came up later was whether your argument is really with testing in general, rather than only with testing in multiple comparison settings.
  
My reply:
 
Yes, my argument is with testing in general.  But it arises with particular force in multiple comparisons.  With a single test, we can just say we dislike testing so we use confidence intervals or Bayesian inference instead, and it’s no problem—really more of a change in emphasis than a change in methods.  But with multiple tests, the classical advice is not simply to look at type 1 error rates but more specifically to make a multiplicity adjustment, for example to make confidence intervals wider to account for multiplicity.  I don’t want to do this!  So here there is a real battle to fight.

<p>Introduction: My article with Cosma Shalizi has appeared in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.  I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.

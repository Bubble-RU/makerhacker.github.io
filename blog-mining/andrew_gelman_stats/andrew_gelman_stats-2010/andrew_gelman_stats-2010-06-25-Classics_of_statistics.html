</p><p>2 I think there’s a lot more good and accessible material in these classic books than in the equivalent volume of classic articles. [sent-7, score-0.712]
</p><p>3 Journal articles can be difficult to read and are typically filled with irrelevant theoretical material, the kind of stuff you need to include to impress the referees. [sent-8, score-0.355]
</p><p>4 One thing that struck me about the list supplied by Christian is how many of these articles I would definitely  not  include in such a course. [sent-12, score-0.404]
</p><p>5 Similarly, I can’t see the point of including the paper by Hastings (1970). [sent-15, score-0.278]
</p><p>6 The paper is fine–I’d be proud to have written it, in fact I’d gladly admit that it’s better than 90% of anything I’ve ever published–but it seems more of a minor note than a “classic. [sent-24, score-0.412]
</p><p>7 It’s a fine article and the EM algorithm has been tremendously useful, but, still, I think it’s more about computation than statistics. [sent-27, score-0.238]
</p><p>8 As to Berger and Sellke (1987), well, yes, this paper has had an immense influence, at least among theoretical statisticians–but I think the paper is basically wrong! [sent-28, score-0.428]
</p><p>9 I don’t want to label a paper as a classic if it’s sent much of the field in the wrong direction. [sent-29, score-0.486]
</p><p>10 For other papers on Christian’s list, I can see the virtue of including in a seminar. [sent-30, score-0.249]
</p><p>11 This article, which appears in a volume of papers dedicated to George Snedecor, is a lot of fun (even if in many ways unsound). [sent-45, score-0.257]
</p><p>12 I prefer this slightly to Mallows’s paper on Cp, written at about the same time (but I like the Mallows paper too). [sent-49, score-0.486]
</p><p>13 The methods in the paper are mostly out of date, but it’s worth it for the discussion (especially the (inadvertently) hilarious contribution of Kempthorne). [sent-53, score-0.273]
</p><p>14 If you only want to include one Rubin article, keep this one and leave “Inference and missing data” for students to discover on their own. [sent-67, score-0.326]
</p><p>15 Perhaps there’s some general principle that papers published in year X have the most influence on graduate students in year X+15. [sent-73, score-0.435]
</p><p>16 Anything earlier seems simply out of date (that’s how I feel about Stein’s classic papers, for example; sure, they’re fine, but I don’t see their relevance to anything I’m doing today, in contrast to the above-noted works by Tukey, Akaike, etc. [sent-74, score-0.541]
</p><p>17 I’m thinking of influential papers by Wilcoxon, Box and Cox, and zillions of papers of that introduced particular hypothesis tests (the sort that have names that they tell you in a biostatistics class). [sent-80, score-0.481]
</p><p>18 Individually, these papers are fine, but I don’t see that students would get much out of reading them. [sent-81, score-0.349]
</p><p>19 If I was going to pick any paper of that genre, I’d pick Deming and Stephan’s 1940 article on iterative proportional fitting. [sent-82, score-0.273]
</p><p>20 Any other classics you’d like to nominate (or places where you disagree with me)? [sent-84, score-0.364]

<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>6 0.15268922 <a title="109-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-06-How_to_think_about_papers_published_in_low-grade_journals%3F.html">1928 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-06-How to think about papers published in low-grade journals?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Chris Said points us to two proposals to fix the system for reviewing scientific papers.  Both the proposals are focused on biological research.
 
Said  writes : 
  
  
The growing problems with scientific research are by now well known: Many results in the top journals are cherry picked, methodological weaknesses and other important caveats are often swept under the rug, and a large fraction of findings cannot be replicated. In some rare cases, there is even outright fraud. This waste of resources is unfair to the general public that pays for most of the research. . . .


Scientists have known about these problems for decades, and there have been several well-intentioned efforts to fix them. The Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis (JASNH) is specifically dedicated to null results. . . . Simmons and colleagues (2011) have proposed lists of regulations for other journals to enforce, including minimum sample sizes and requirements for the disclosure of all variables and</p><p>4 0.7683332 <a title="109-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya. We think it’s a remarkable mode</p><p>4 0.97810197 <a title="109-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>5 0.97658503 <a title="109-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-28-Reference_on_longitudinal_models%3F.html">1188 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-28-Reference on longitudinal models?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Antonio Ramos writes:
  
The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.  Beyond that, I think there is good work in psychometrics on covaraince structures but I donâ&euro;&trade;t know the literature.</p><p>6 0.97420454 <a title="109-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-18-Mertz%E2%80%99s_reply_to_Unz%E2%80%99s_response_to_Mertz%E2%80%99s_comments_on_Unz%E2%80%99s_article.html">1768 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-18-Mertz’s reply to Unz’s response to Mertz’s comments on Unz’s article</a></p>

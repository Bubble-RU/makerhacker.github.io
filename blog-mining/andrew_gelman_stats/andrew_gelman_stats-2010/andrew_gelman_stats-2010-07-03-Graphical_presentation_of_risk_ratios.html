I thought I had read on your blog that bar charts should always include zero on the scale, but a search of your blog (or google) didn’t return what I was looking for.  Is it considered a best practice to always include zero on the axis for bar charts?  Has this been written in a book?
  
My reply:
 
The idea is that the area of the bar represents “how many” or “how much.” The bar has to go down to 0 for that to work.  You don’t have to have your y-axis go to zero, but if you want the axis to go anywhere else, don’t use a bar graph, use a line graph.  Usually line graphs are better anyway.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  writes :
  
I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!

<p>Introduction: This assessment  by Tyler Cowen reminded me that, in 1980, I and just about all my friends hated Jimmy Carter.  Most of us much preferred him to Reagan but still hated Carter.  I wouldn’t associate this with any particular ideological feeling—it’s not that we thought he was too liberal, or too conservative.  He just seemed completely ineffectual.  I remember feeling at the time that he had no principles, that he’d do anything to get elected.
 
In retrospect, I think of this as an instance of uniform partisan swing:  the president was unpopular nationally, and attitudes about him were negative, relatively speaking, among just about every group.
 
My other Carter story comes from a conversation I had a couple years ago with an economist who’s about my age, a man who said that one reason he and his family moved from town A to town B in his metropolitan area was that, in town B, they didn’t feel like they were the only Republicans on their block.

I don’t think so.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.

<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

<p>Introduction: According to the  National Weather Service :
  
What is a 100 year flood?  A 100 year flood is an event that statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. A 500 year flood has a .2% chance of occurring and a 1000 year flood has a .1% chance of occurring.
  
The accompanying map shows a part of Tennessee that in May 2010 had 1000-year levels of flooding.
 
 
 
At first, it seems hard to believe that a 1000-year flood would have just happened to occur last year.  But then, this is just a 1000-year flood for that particular place.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t really have a sense of the statistics of these events.  How many 100-year, 500-year, and 1000-year flood events have been recorded by the Weather Service, and when have they occurred?</p><p>same-blog 4 0.80057347 <a title="126-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-03-Graphical_presentation_of_risk_ratios.html">126 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-03-Graphical presentation of risk ratios</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff writes:
  
How far off is bglmer and can it handle ordered logit or multinom logit?
  
My reply:
 
bglmer is very close.  No ordered logit but I was just talking about it with Sophia today.  My guess is that the easiest way to fit a hierarchical ordered logit or multinom logit will be to use stan.  For right now I’d recommend using glmer/bglmer to fit the ordered logits in order (e.g., 1 vs. 2,3,4, then 2 vs. 3,4, then 3 vs. 4).  Or maybe there’s already a hierarchical multinomial logit in mcmcpack or somewhere?</p><p>6 0.76290601 <a title="126-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Felix_Salmon_wins_the_American_Statistical_Association%E2%80%99s_Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">33 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Felix Salmon wins the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>

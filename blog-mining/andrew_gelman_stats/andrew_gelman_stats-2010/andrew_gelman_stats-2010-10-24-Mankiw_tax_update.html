<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to a  blog  by Greg Mankiw with further details on his argument that his anticipated 90% marginal tax rate will reduce his work level.
 
Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.

Neither Cowen nor Mankiw address</p><p>5 0.33418128 <a title="366-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.24781604 <a title="366-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-Economists_don%E2%80%99t_think_like_accountants%E2%80%94but_maybe_they_should.html">922 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-Economists don’t think like accountants—but maybe they should</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.80473346 <a title="366-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-30-A_tax_on_inequality%2C_or_a_tax_to_keep_inequality_at_the_current_level%3F.html">1145 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-30-A tax on inequality, or a tax to keep inequality at the current level?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.  At the time, I conjectured this was a general difference in attitude between political scientists and economists, but in retrospect I realize I’m dealing with n=1 in each case.
 
 See here  for further discussion of taxing “justly acquired endowments.”
 
The only reason I’m bringing this all up now is that I think it is relevant to our recent discussion  here  and  here  of Mankiw’s work incentives.  Mankiw objected to paying a higher marginal tax rate, and I think part of this is that he sees taxes as a form of punishment, and since he came by his income honestly he doesn’t think it’s fair to have to pay taxes on it.   My perspective i</p><p>4 0.84161496 <a title="366-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-It_depends_upon_what_the_meaning_of_the_word_%E2%80%9Cfirm%E2%80%9D_is..html">940 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-It depends upon what the meaning of the word “firm” is.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .

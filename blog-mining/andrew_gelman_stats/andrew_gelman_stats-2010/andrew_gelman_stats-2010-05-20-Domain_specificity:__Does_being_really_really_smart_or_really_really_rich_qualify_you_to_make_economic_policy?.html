<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:
 
1.  Not enough bridge projects, huh?  I don’t believe it.  We’ve been hearing fo</p><p>3 0.27934733 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>4 0.21824008 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-26-One_fun_thing_about_physicists_._._..html">431 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-26-One fun thing about physicists . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: . . . they’re  not  in awe of economists.
 
In contrast, economists sometimes treat each other with the soft bigotry of low expectations.  For example, here’s Brad DeLong in defense of Larry Summers:
  
[During a 2005 meeting, Summers] said that in a modern economy with sophisticated financial markets we were likely to have more and bigger financial crises than we had before, just as the worst modern transportation accidents are worse than the worst transportation accidents back in horse-and-buggy days. . . . Indeed, for twenty years one of Larry’s conversation openers has been: “You really should write something else good on positive-feedback trading and its dangers for financial markets.”
  
That’s fine, but, hey, I’ve been going around saying this for many years too, and I’m not even an economist (although I did get an A in the last econ class I took, which was in eleventh grade).   Lots and lots of people  have been talking for years about the dangers of positive feedback, the risk</p><p>5 0.15099657 <a title="45-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-03-Objects_of_the_class_%E2%80%9CLawrence_Summers%E2%80%9D%3A__Arne_Duncan_edition.html">2122 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-03-Objects of the class “Lawrence Summers”:  Arne Duncan edition</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .

<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:
 
1.  Not enough bridge projects, huh?  I don’t believe it.  We’ve been hearing fo</p><p>6 0.81032544 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Life_in_New_York%2C_Then_and_Now.html">139 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Life in New York, Then and Now</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>2 0.95298856 <a title="45-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>3 0.95087302 <a title="45-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project_qualifying_exam_process%3A__An_intensified_dialogue_between_students_and_faculty.html">308 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project qualifying exam process:  An intensified dialogue between students and faculty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>4 0.94613683 <a title="45-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-Estimating_seasonality_with_a_data_set_that%E2%80%99s_just_52_weeks_long.html">1513 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-Estimating seasonality with a data set that’s just 52 weeks long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>same-blog 5 0.94407797 <a title="45-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Domain_specificity%3A__Does_being_really_really_smart_or_really_really_rich_qualify_you_to_make_economic_policy%3F.html">45 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Domain specificity:  Does being really really smart or really really rich qualify you to make economic policy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s this idea called “domain specificity” that I learned from my sister many years ago:  it’s the idea that a skill might work in some domains but not others. For example, knowing (some) Spanish helps a bit with my French but it doesn’t do anything for my Chinese.  Traditionally in psychometrics, this sort of thing is studied using correlation–scores on various math tests are highly correlated with each other, and these are also correlated (but less so) with scores on English tests.  Michael Jordan would probably be good at just about any sport he tried (even if he couldn’t quite hit the curveball).  Top actors can typically sing, dance, do magic, etc.–they’re great all-around performers.  And so on.
 
I was reminded of domain specificity after reading a  blog  by Felix Salmon arguing that Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers made big mistakes when they served as Treasury Secretaries during the Clinton administration.  Salmon writes:

<p>Introduction: Super cool post  from Jamis Buck on mazemaking algorithms.  It’s set up so you can click and see the maze being formed, for each of 11 different algorithms!
 
When I was about 12, I was really into making mazes.  I’d make them on graph paper and give many of them out to my friends.  Somewhere along the way I lost most of them, but I remember it was a fun challenge to figure out how to make them difficult.  I don’t know about these automatic maze generation algorithms, but handmade mazes (of the sort that used to appear in puzzle books) often had the problem that they were really easy to solve if you started at the end and worked back to the beginning.  I didn’t want that, so when I designed my own mazes, I’d start from each of the two ends and then work out the middle.  I remember one maze I was particularly proud of that had no dead ends.  The dud paths just looped back to the beginning area, and you had to find the path that made it all the way through.

<p>Introduction: Mark Girolami points us to  this paper and software  (with Oksana Chkrebtii, David Campbell, and Ben Calderhead).  They write:
  
We develop a general methodology for the probabilistic integration of differential equations via model based updating of a joint prior measure on the space of functions and their temporal and spatial derivatives. This results in a posterior measure over functions reflecting how well they satisfy the system of differential equations and corresponding initial and boundary values. We show how this posterior measure can be naturally incorporated within the Kennedy and O’Hagan framework for uncertainty quantification and provides a fully Bayesian approach to model calibration. . . . A broad variety of examples are provided to illustrate the potential of this framework for characterising discretization uncertainty, including initial value, delay, and boundary value differential equations, as well as partial differential equations.

I [Axelrod] am interested in building a model that predicts voting on the precinct level, using variables such as party registration, age, sex, income etc. Surely political scientists have worked on this problem.


I would be grateful for any reference you could provide in the way of articles and books.
  
My reply:  Political scientists have worked on this problem, and it’s easy enough to imagine hierarchical models of the sort discussed in my book with Jennifer. I can picture what I would do if asked to forecast at the precinct level, for example to model exit polls.  (In fact, I was briefly hired by the exit poll consortium in 2000 to do this, but then after I told them about hierarchical Bayes, they un-hired me!)  But I don’t actually know of any literature on precinct-level forecasting.

<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>4 0.73927861 <a title="459-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-09-The_future_of_R.html">266 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-09-The future of R</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some thoughts from Christian , including this bit:
  
We need to consider separately


1. R’s brilliant library


2. R’s not-so-brilliant language and/or interpreter.
  
I don’t know that R’s library is so brilliant as all that–if necessary, I don’t think it would be hard to reprogram the important packages in a new language.
 
I would say, though, that the problems with R are not just in the technical details of the language.  I think the culture of R has some problems too.  As I’ve written before, R functions used to be lean and mean, and now they’re full of exception-handling and calls to other packages.  R functions are spaghetti-like messes of connections in which I keep expecting to run into syntax like “GOTO 120.”
 
I learned about these problems a couple years ago when writing bayesglm(), which is a simple adaptation of glm().  But glm(), and its workhorse, glm.fit(), are a mess:  They’re about 10 lines of functioning code, plus about 20 lines of necessary front-end, plus a cou</p><p>5 0.73497367 <a title="459-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-19-Tempering_and_modes.html">1018 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-19-Tempering and modes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gustavo  writes:
  
Tempering should always be done in the spirit of *searching* for important modes of the distribution.  If we assume that we know where they are, then there is no point to tempering. Now, tempering is actually a *bad* way of searching for important modes, it just happens to be easy to program.  As always, my [Gustavo's] prescription is to FIRST find the important modes (as a pre-processing step); THEN sample from each mode independently; and FINALLY weight the samples appropriately, based on the estimated probability mass of each mode, though things might get messy if you end 
up jumping between modes.
  
My reply:
 
1.  Parallel tempering has always seemed like a great idea, but I have to admit that the only time I tried it (with Matt2 on the tree-ring example), it didn’t work for us.
 
2.  You say you’d rather sample from the modes and then average over them.  But that won’t work if if you have a zillion modes.

<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: Phil pointed me to  this paper  so I thought I probably better repeat what I  wrote  a couple years ago:
 
1. The effects are certainly not zero. We are not machines, and anything that can affect our expectations (for example, our success in previous tries) should affect our performance.
 
2. The effects I’ve seen are small, on the order of 2 percentage points (for example, the probability of a success in some sports task might be 45% if you’re “hot” and 43% otherwise).
 
3. There’s a huge amount of variation, not just between but also among players. Sometimes if you succeed you will stay relaxed and focused, other times you can succeed and get overconfidence.
 
4. Whatever the latest results on particular sports, I can’t see anyone overturning the basic finding of Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky that players and spectators alike will perceive the hot hand even when it does not exist and dramatically overestimate the magnitude and consistency of any hot-hand phenomenon that does exist.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.87997353 <a title="459-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-09-Solve_mazes_by_starting_at_the_exit.html">459 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-09-Solve mazes by starting at the exit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It worked on  this one .
 
Good maze designers know this trick and are careful to design multiple branches in each direction. Back when I was in junior high, I used to make huge mazes, and the basic idea was to anticipate what the solver might try to do and to make the maze difficult by postponing the point at which he would realize a path was going nowhere.  For example, you might have 6 branches:  one dead end, two pairs that form loops going back to the start, and one that is the correct solution.  You do this from both directions and add some twists and turns, and there you are.
 
But the maze designer aiming for the naive solver–the sap who starts from the entrance and goes toward the exit–can simplify matters by just having 6 branches:  five dead ends and one winner.  This sort of thing is easy to solve in the reverse direction.  I’m surprised the Times didn’t do better for their special puzzle issue.</p><p>6 0.86185181 <a title="459-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-10-He_said_he_was_sorry.html">1756 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-10-He said he was sorry</a></p>

<p>Introduction: See below for the job announcement.  It’s for Teachers College, which is about 2 blocks from the statistics department and 2 blocks from the political science department.  So even though I don’t have any official connection with Teachers College (besides occasionally working with them on research projects), I very much would like to have another exciting young applied researcher here, to complement all the people we currently have in stat, poli sci, engineering, etc.  In particular, we have zillions of interesting and important social science research projects going on here, and they all need statistics work.  A lot of social scientists do statistics, but it’s not so easy to find a statistician who does serious social science research.
 
All this is to say that I hope this job gets some applicants from some people who are serious about applied statistics and the development of new models and methods.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.  For example, from an  official documen t, “The primary purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participati</p><p>4 0.11878312 <a title="209-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-The_placebo_effect_in_pharma.html">388 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-The placebo effect in pharma</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bruce McCullough writes:
  
The Sept 2009 issue of Wired had a  big article  on the increase in the placebo effect, and why it’s been getting bigger.


Kaiser Fung has a  synopsis .


As if you don’t have enough to do, I thought you might be interested in blogging on this.
  
My reply:
 
I thought Kaiser’s discussion was good, especially this point:
  
Effect on treatment group = Effect of the drug + effect of belief in being treated


Effect on placebo group = Effect of belief in being treated


Thus, the difference between the two groups = effect of the drug, since the effect of belief in being treated affects both groups of patients.
  
Thus, as Kaiser puts it, if the treatment isn’t doing better than placebo, it doesn’t say that the placebo effect is big (let alone “too big”) but that the treatment isn’t showing any additional effect.  It’s “treatment + placebo” vs. placebo, not treatment vs. placebo.
 
That said, I’d prefer for Kaiser to make it clear that the additivity he’s assu</p><p>5 0.11736339 <a title="209-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-04-The_Case_for_More_False_Positives_in_Anti-doping_Testing.html">648 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-04-The Case for More False Positives in Anti-doping Testing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This one belongs in the statistical lexicon.  Kaiser Fung  nails it :
  
In reading [news] articles, we must look out for the moment(s) when the reporters announce story time. Much of the article is great propaganda for the statistics lobby, describing an attempt to use observational data to address a practical question, sort of a Freakonomics-style application.


We have no problems when they say things like: “There is a substantial gap at year’s end between students whose teachers were in the top 10% in effectiveness and the bottom 10%. The fortunate students ranked 17 percentile points higher in English and 25 points higher in math.”


Or this: “On average, Smith’s students slide under his instruction, losing 14 percentile points in math during the school year relative to their peers districtwide, The Times found. Overall, he ranked among the least effective of the district’s elementary school teachers.”


Midway through the article (right before the section called “Study in contras</p><p>3 0.7474823 <a title="209-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-09-%E2%80%9C%E2%80%98Why_work%3F%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D.html">461 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-09-“‘Why work?’”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links to  a “scary comparison” that claims that “a one-parent family of three making $14,500 a year (minimum wage) has more disposable income than a family making $60,000 a year.”
 
Kaiser Fung  looks into this comparison  in more detail.  As Kaiser puts it:
  
 
If we concede that the middle-income person would end up with less disposable income than the lower-income person, then we’d expect that the middle-income people will take lower-paying jobs so as to increase their disposable income. But I have not seen reports of such reverse social mobility. Theory needs to fit reality. This hole in the theory needs to be covered.
 

 
This argument sounds convincing at first, but I’m not completely sure it’s right.  I’d just like to expand on one of Kaiser’s other points, which is that people don’t usually have a choice between a minimum-wage job and a $60,000 job.  Also, my impression is that higher-paying jobs are more pleasant than lower-paying jobs.
 
Let me put it another w</p><p>4 0.74612784 <a title="209-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-02-Grouponomics%2C_counterfactuals%2C_and_opportunity_cost.html">742 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-02-Grouponomics, counterfactuals, and opportunity cost</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I keep encountering the word “Groupon”–I think it’s some sort of pets.com-style commercial endeavor where people can buy coupons?  I don’t really care, and I’ve avoided googling the word out of a general animosity toward our society’s current glorification of get-rich-quick schemes.  (As you can tell, I’m still bitter about that whole  stock market  thing.)
 
Anyway, even without knowing what Groupon actually is, I enjoyed  this blog  by Kaiser Fung in which he tries to work out some of its economic consequences.  He connects the statistical notion of counterfactuals to the concept of opportunity cost from economics.  The comments are interesting too.</p><p>5 0.74294019 <a title="209-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-NYT_shills_for_personal_DNA_tests.html">543 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-NYT shills for personal DNA tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>6 0.72472095 <a title="209-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-18-Not_as_ugly_as_you_look.html">1174 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-18-Not as ugly as you look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago I was cleaning out the closet and found some old unread magazines.  Good stuff.  As we’ve discussed  before , lots of things are better read a few years late.
 
Today I was reading the 18 Nov 2004 issue of the London Review of Books, which contained (among other things) the following:
 
- A review by Jenny Diski of a biography of Stanley Milgram.  Diski appears to want to debunk:
  
Milgram was a whiz at devising sexy experiments, but barely interested in any theoretical basis for them.  They all have the same instant attractiveness of style, and then an underlying emptiness.
  
Huh?  Michael Jordan couldn’t hit the curveball and he was reportedly an easy mark for golf hustlers but that doesn’t diminish his greatness on the basketball court.

<p>Introduction: Florence from customer support at  Hipmunk  writes:
  
Hipmunk now includes American Airlines in our search results. Please note that users will be taken directly to AA.com to complete the booking/transaction. . . . we are steadily increasing the number of flights that we offer on Hipmunk.
  
As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.  The regular Amtrak website is about as horrible as you’d expect.</p><p>4 0.95368797 <a title="209-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk_worked.html">2238 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk worked</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past I’ve categorized Hipmunk as  a really cool flight-finder that doesn’t actually work , as  worse than Expedia , and as  graphics without content .
 
So, I thought it would be only fair to tell you that I bought a flight the other day using Hipmunk and it gave me the same flight as Expedia but at a lower cost (by linking to something called CheapOair, which I hope is legit).  So score one for Hipmunk.</p><p>5 0.95195305 <a title="209-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-Approaching_harmonic_convergence.html">1099 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-Approaching harmonic convergence</a></p>

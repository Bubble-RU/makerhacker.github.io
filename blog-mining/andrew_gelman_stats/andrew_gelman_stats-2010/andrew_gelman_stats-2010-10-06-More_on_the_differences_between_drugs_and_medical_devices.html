<p>Introduction: Sanjay Kaul wrotes:
  
By statute (“the least burdensome” pathway), the approval standard for devices by the US FDA is lower than for drugs. Before a new drug can be marketed, the sponsor must show “substantial evidence of effectiveness” as based on two or more well-controlled clinical studies (which literally means 2 trials, each with a p value of <0.05, or 1 large trial with a robust p value <0.00125). In contrast, the sponsor of a new device, especially those that are designated as high-risk (Class III) device, need only demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to an FDA-approved device via the 510(k) exemption or a "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness", evaluated through a pre-market approval and typically based on a single study.


What does “reasonable assurance” or “substantial equivalence” imply to you as a Bayesian? These are obviously qualitative constructs, but if one were to quantify them, how would you go about addressing it?

<p>Introduction: On the side of less regulation is  Alex Tabarrok  in “Our DNA, Our Selves”:
  
At the same time that the NSA is secretly and illegally obtaining information about Americans the FDA is making it illegal for Americans to obtain information about themselves. 
In a warning letter the FDA has told Anne Wojcicki, The Most Daring CEO In America, that she “must immediately discontinue” selling 23andMe’s Personal Genome Service . . .
  
Alex clarifies:
  
I am not offended by all regulation of genetic tests. Indeed, genetic tests are already regulated. . . . the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) . . . requires all labs, including the labs used by 23andMe, to be inspected for quality control, record keeping and the qualifications of their personnel. . . .


What the FDA wants to do is categorically different.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan  gives the story .
 
Here’s Sarah Palin’s statement introducing the now-notorious phrase:
  
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s “death panel” so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.
  
And now Brendan:
  
Palin’s language suggests that a “death panel” would determine whether individual patients receive care based on their “level of productivity in society.” This was — and remains — false. Denying coverage at a system level for specific treatments or drugs is not equivalent to “decid[ing], based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society.’”
  
Seems like an open-and-shut case to me.  The “bureaucrats” (I think Palin is referring to “government employees”) are making decisions based on studies of the drug’s effectiveness:

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.


Specifically, the so-called P value — a mathematical measure of the strength of the evidence that there’s a true difference between a treatment and placebo — was 0.08. . . . Technically, the study was a bust, although the results leaned toward a benefit from interferon gamma-1b. Was there a group of patients in which the results tipped?

<p>Introduction: Someone who works in statistics in the pharmaceutical industry (but prefers to remain anonymous) sent me  this update  to our discussion on the differences between approvals of drugs and medical devices:
  
The ‘substantial equivalence’ threshold is a very outdated. Basically the FDA has to follow federal law and the law is antiquated and leads to two extraordinarily different paths for device approval.


You could have a very simple but first-in-kind device with an easy to understand physiological mechanism of action (e.g. the FDA approved a simple tiny stent that would relieve pressure from a glaucoma patient’s eye this summer).  This device would require a standard (likely controlled) trial at the one-sided 0.025 level. Even after the trial it would likely go to a panel where outside experts (e.g.practicing & academic MDs and statisticians) hear evidence from the company and FDA and vote on its safety and efficacy.  FDA would then rule, consider the panel’s vote, on whether to appro</p><p>2 0.92454863 <a title="322-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-To_commenters_who_are_trying_to_sell_something.html">839 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-To commenters who are trying to sell something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>4 0.83599806 <a title="322-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-16-Detecting_cheating_in_chess.html">1676 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-16-Detecting cheating in chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Three different people have pointed me to  this post  by Ken Regan on statistical evaluation of claims of cheating in chess.  So I figured I have to satisfy demand and post something on this.  But I have nothing to say.  All these topics interest me, but I somehow had difficulty reading through the entire post.  I scanned through but what I really wanted to see was some data.  Show me a scatterplot, then I’ll get interested.
 
P.S.  This is meant as no disparagement of Regan or his blog.  I just couldn’t quite get into this particular example.</p><p>5 0.83248007 <a title="322-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-16-Chess_vs._checkers.html">615 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-16-Chess vs. checkers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces. The result is a series of elegant graph problems where the viable paths change with each move of your opponent. To draw an analogy with chess, imagine if moving your knight could allow your opponent’s bishop to move like a rook. Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?


Part of the problem is that we learn the game as children so we tend to think of it as a children’s game. We focus on how simple the rules are and miss how much complexity and subtlety you can get out of those ru</p><p>6 0.82778072 <a title="322-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-20-When_Kerry_Met_Sally%3A_Politics_and_Perceptions_in_the_Demand_for_Movies.html">358 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-20-When Kerry Met Sally: Politics and Perceptions in the Demand for Movies</a></p>

What I do is post once a day; when I write new posts, I schedule them for the future.  I currently have approx 2-month lag.

<p>Introduction: I was talking with a colleague about one of our research projects and said that I would write something up, if blogging didn’t get in the way.  She suggested that for the next month I just blog about my research ideas.
 
So I think I’ll do that.  This means no mocking of plagiarists, no reflections on literature, no answers to miscellaneous questions about how many groups you need in a multilevel model, no rants about economists, no links to pretty graphs, etc., for 30 days.
 
Meanwhile, I have a roughly 30-day backlog.  So after my next 30 days of stat blogging, the backlog will gradually appear.  There’s some good stuff there, including reflections on Milos, a (sincere) tribute to the haters, an updated Twitteo Killed the Bloggio Star, a question about acupuncture, and some remote statistical modeling advice I gave that actually worked!  I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.

<p>Introduction: I post (approximately) once a day and don’t plan to change that.
 
I have enough material to post more often—for example, I could intersperse existing blog posts with summaries of my published papers or of other work that I like; and, beyond this, we currently have a one-to-two-month backlog of posts—but I’m afraid that if the number of posts were doubled, the attention given to each would be roughly halved.
 
Looking at it the other way, I certainly don’t want to  reduce  my level of posting.  Sure, it takes time to blog, but these are things that are important for me to say.  If I were to blog less frequently, it would only be because I was pouring all these words into a different vessel, for example a book.  For now, though, I think it makes sense to blog and then collect the words later as appropriate.  With blogging I get comments, and many of these comments are helpful—either directly (by pointing out errors in my thinking or linking to relevant software or literature) or indirec</p><p>5 0.11848311 <a title="104-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-Blog_in_motion.html">790 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-Blog in motion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the next few days weâ&euro;&trade;ll be changing the format of the blog and moving it to a new server.  If you have difficulty posting comments, just wait and post them in a few days when all should be working well.  (But if you can post a comment, go for it.  All the old entries and comments should be reappearing in the reconstituted blog.)</p><p>6 0.1171947 <a title="104-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-06-Inbox_zero.__Really..html">259 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-06-Inbox zero.

I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>3 0.90306234 <a title="104-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-05-Related_to_z-statistics.html">1301 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-05-Related to z-statistics</a></p>

I am writing to seek your help in building a community driven Q&A; website tentatively called called ‘Statistics Analysis’. I am neither a founder of this website nor do I have any financial stake in its success. 


By way of background to this website, please see Stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/) and Mathoverflow (http://mathoverflow.net/).

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko points me to a  news article  by Zack Beauchamp on Jason Richwine, the recent Ph.D. graduate from Harvard’s policy school who left the conservative Heritage Foundation after it came out that his Ph.D. thesis was said to be all  about  the low IQ’s of Hispanic immigrants.  Heritage and  others  apparently thought this association could discredit their anti-immigration-reform position.  Richwine’s mentor Charles Murray was  unhappy  about the whole episode.
 
Beauchamp’s article is worth reading in that it provides some interesting background, in particular by getting into the details of the Ph.D. review process.  In a sense, Beauchamp is too harsh.  Flawed Ph.D. theses get published all the time.  I’d say that  most  Ph.D. theses I’ve seen are flawed:  usually the plan is to get the papers into shape later, when submitting them to journals.  If a student doesn’t go into academia, the thesis typically just sits there and is rarely followed up on.

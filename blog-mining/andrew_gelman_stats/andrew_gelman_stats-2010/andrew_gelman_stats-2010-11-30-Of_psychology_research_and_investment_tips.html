<p>Introduction: The Association for Psychological Science, the leading organization of research psychologists, announced a long-awaited new journal,  Speculations on Psychological Science .  From the official APS press release:
  
Speculations on Psychological Science, the flagship journal of the Association for Psychological Science, will publish cutting-edge research articles, short reports, and research reports spanning the entire spectrum of the science of psychology. We anticipate that Speculations on Psychological Science will be the highest ranked empirical journal in psychology. We recognize that many of the most noteworthy published claims in psychology and related fields are not well supported by data, hence the need for a journal for the publication of such exciting speculations without misleading claims of certainty.


- Sigmund Watson, Prof. (Ret.) Miskatonic University, and editor-in-chief, Speculations on Psychological Science

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  comments on  the (presumably) well-intentioned but silly  Jumpstart test of financial literacy , which was given to 7000 high school seniors  Given that, as we heard a few years back, most high school seniors can’t locate Miami on a map of the U.S., you won’t be surprised to hear that they flubbed item after item on this quiz.
 
But, as Palko points out, the concept is better than the execution:
  
 
With the complex, unstable economy, the shift away from traditional pensions and the constant flood of new financial products, financial literacy might be more important now than it has been for decades. You could even make the case for financial illiteracy being a major cause of the economic crisis.


But if the supporters of financial literacy need a good measure of how well we’re doing, they’ll need to find a better instrument than the Jump$tart survey.


The ‘test’ part of the survey consists of thirty-one questions.

Akinola Modupe and Katherine Milkman responded to  my email  about  their study :
  
We want to clarify the reason we believe that the use of deception and a lack of informed consent were appropriate and ethical for this research study. In this project, we were studying how the timing of a decision affects discrimination based on race and/or gender.  The emails all participants in our study received were identical except for a) the sender’s name (we used 20 names that pretesting revealed were strongly associated with being either Caucasian, Black, Indian, Chinese or Hispanic, as well as associated with being male or female) and b) whether the meeting requested was for today or for a week from today.  Recipients were randomly selected and were randomly assigned to one of the race/gender/timing conditions.  This study design will allow us to test for baseline levels of discrimination in acade</p><p>3 0.63510972 <a title="439-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-22-Ticket_to_Baaaaarf.html">2301 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-22-Ticket to Baaaaarf</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A link from the comments here took me to the wonderfully named  Barfblog  and a report by Don Schaffner on some reporting.
 
 First, the background:   A university in England issued a press release saying that “Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria than if it is left for longer periods of time . . . The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the ‘5 second rule’  – the urban myth about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped.”  According to the press release, the study was “undertaken by final year Biology students” and led by a professor of microbiology.
 
The press release hit the big time, hitting NPR, Slate, Forbes, the Daily News, etc etc.  Some typical headlines:

<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>4 0.82886875 <a title="439-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>5 0.81039321 <a title="439-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-24-Statistical_ethics_violation.html">1081 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-24-Statistical ethics violation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

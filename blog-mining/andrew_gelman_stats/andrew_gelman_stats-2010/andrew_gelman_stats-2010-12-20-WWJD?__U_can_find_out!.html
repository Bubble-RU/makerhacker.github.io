<p>Introduction: David Hogg points me to  this  announcement of a program from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics of the National Science Foundation:
  
The Center would like to enhance its efforts to support analytic and methodological research in support of its surveys, and to engage in the education and training of researchers in the use of large-scale nationally representative datasets. NCSES welcomes efforts by the research community to use NCSES data for research on the science and technology enterprise.
  
This sounds like a job for Mister P.  My first thought when David sent this to me was  not  to post it, because maybe I’d want to apply myself!  But then I thought better of my piggy instincts, so here it is.  I think some of the readers of this blog are doing research that would be relevant for this program, so . . . go for it!</p><p>4 0.12081413 <a title="479-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-20-That%E2%80%99s_crazy_talk%21.html">2108 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-20-That’s crazy talk!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  story  (“Yale tells students to keep Kissinger talk secret . . . ‘Dr. Kissinger’s visit to campus will not be publicized, so we appreciate your confidentiality…’”) reminds me of two things:
 
- In the 1980s, I once went to a public lecture at Harvard by Kissinger protogé Ted Koppel, who indeed has that deep Ted Koppel voice even when he’s just chatting (as I overheard).  Koppel insisted that the contents of his talk not be reported.  It was no great loss; he didn’t really have anything newsworthy to say.  The talk was fine, he told us some interesting things, just nothing that would’ve made the news or even the campus newspaper.  Still, it seemed kinda tacky for a reporter whose shtick was access to the powerful, to not want his own speech to be reported. 
 
- In the 1990s, a colleague of mine in a different dept told us that this professor from another university was coming by to give a lecture.  I told my colleague that I’d like to meet with the guy, as I wanted to ask his opin</p><p>6 0.11461195 <a title="479-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Time_to_apply_for_the_hackNY_summer_fellows_program.html">412 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Time to apply for the hackNY summer fellows program</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>3 0.80547911 <a title="479-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-14-5_books_on_essentialism%21.html">905 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-14-5 books on essentialism!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.

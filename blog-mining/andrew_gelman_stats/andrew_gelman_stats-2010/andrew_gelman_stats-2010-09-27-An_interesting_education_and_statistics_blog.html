<p>Introduction: A friend asks the above question and writes:
  
 This article  left me thinking – how could the IRS not notice that this guy didn’t file taxes for several years? Don’t they run checks and notice if you miss a year? If I write a check our of order, there’s an asterisk next to the check number in my next bank statement showing that there was a gap in the sequence.


If you ran the IRS, wouldn’t you do this: SSNs are issued sequentially. Once a SSN reaches 18, expect it to file a return. If it doesn’t, mail out a postage paid letter asking why not with check boxes such as Student, Unemployed, etc. Follow up at reasonable intervals. Eventually every SSN should be filing a return, or have an international address. Yes this is intrusive, but my goal is only to maximize tax revenue. Surely people who do this for a living could come up with something more elegant.
  
My response:
 
I dunno, maybe some confidentiality rules?  The other thing is that I’m guessing that IRS gets lots of pushback w</p><p>5 0.082560591 <a title="297-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-The_weirdest_thing_about_the_AJPH_story.html">1916 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-The weirdest thing about the AJPH story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Earlier today I  posted  a weird email that began with “You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years” and continued with a sleazy attempt to squeeze $1000 out of me so that an article that I sent them for free could be available to the public.  $1000 might seem like a lot, but they assured me that “we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate.”  Sort of like a Vegematic but without that set of Ginsu knives thrown in for free.
 
But then when I was responding to comments, I realized that . . . I didn’t actually remember ever publishing anything in that journal.  It’s not on my list of 100+ journals.  I did a search on my published papers page and couldn’t find anything closer than the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health (and that was not within the last few years).  I checked Google Scholar.  And then I went straight to the AJPH webpage and sea</p><p>6 0.082335323 <a title="297-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-07-Bayesian_hierarchical_model_for_the_prediction_of_soccer_results.html">20 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-07-Bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of soccer results</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>3 0.59983701 <a title="297-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-09-Plaig.html">1755 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-09-Plaig</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This , from Jeremy Duns (previously encountered  here ), resonates with me:
  
When I asked Thayer why he hadn’t cited Zeigler, he told me very forcefully that he had cited  everything , and accused me of libelling him: this means, presumably, that he accused me of libel without checking his article and seeing the ‘citations’ weren’t there. And when he did finally spot that, why did he not tell me I was right, apologize, get them added and explain to me, on his site, below the article or anywhere else that his editor had accidentally missed out his attributions?
  
It’s so frustrating.  The kind of people who cheat also seem to be the kind of people who lie when caught at it, and the kind of people who  never ever apologize .</p><p>4 0.5845387 <a title="297-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Lauryn_Hill_update.html">233 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Lauryn Hill update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wegman:  “It’s not reprinted 100 percent like you had it.”
 
Wikipedia guy:  “No, you added another paragraph at the end and you changed the headline. . . . You even copied the typos that I’ve corrected on my website.  It was taken verbatim and reprinted in your paper.”
 
The original author got a  check  for $500 but, unfortunately, no free subscription to “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics” (a $1400-$2800  value ).
 
P.S.  To those who think I’m being mean to Wegman:  I haven’t yet heard that he’s apologized to the people whose work he copied without attribution, or to the people who spent their time tracking all this down, or to the U.S. Congress for misrepresenting his expertise in his official report.
 
Everyone makes mistakes, and just about everyone has ethical lapses at times.  But when you get caught you’re supposed to make apology and restitution.</p><p>6 0.58116573 <a title="297-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-30-rms2.html">981 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-30-rms2</a></p>

 Here is a link  to the new stuff.  The update is a little less than half way down the page.


1. used display() instead of summary()


2. include a proxy for [non] newbies — whether I can find their name in a previous Chicago Marathon.


3. graph actual pace vs. fitted pace (color code newbie proxy)


4. estimate the model separately for newbies and non-newbies.


some incidental discussion of sd of errors.

<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):
 
   
 
Anyway, with all this, I was primed to be interested in a recent  study  by psychologist</p><p>4 0.40211272 <a title="297-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-12-Stan_1.3.0_and_RStan_1.3.0_Ready_for_Action.html">1799 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-12-Stan 1.3.0 and RStan 1.3.0 Ready for Action</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since we’re  talking  about the scaled inverse Wishart . . . here’s a recent message from Chris Chatham:
 
I have been reading your book on Bayesian Hierarchical/Multilevel Modeling but have been struggling a bit with deciding whether to model my multivariate normal distribution using the scaled inverse Wishart approach you advocate given the arguments at  this blog post  [entitled "Why an inverse-Wishart prior may not be such a good idea"].
 
My reply:  We discuss this in our book.  We know the inverse-Wishart has problems, that’s why we recommend the  scaled  inverse-Wishart, which is a more general class of models.   Here ‘s an old blog post on the topic.  And also of course there’s the description in our book.
 
Chris pointed me to the following  comment  by Simon Barthelmé:
  
Using the scaled inverse Wishart doesn’t change anything, the standard deviations of the invidual coefficients and their covariance are still dependent. My answer would be to use a prior that models the stan</p><p>6 0.39853531 <a title="297-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-10-My_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1311 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-10-My final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

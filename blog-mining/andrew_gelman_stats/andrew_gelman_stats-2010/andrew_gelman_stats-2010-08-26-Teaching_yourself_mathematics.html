In courses like high school history and science, the emphasis on passively acquiring knowledge (yes, I realize that students write essays in history classes and apply formulas in science classes but that represents a relatively small portion of their time and, more importantly, the work those students do is fundamentally different from the day-to-day work done by historians and scientists).

<p>Introduction: I studied math and physics at MIT. To be more precise, I started in math as default–ever since I was two years old, I’ve thought of myself as a mathematician, and I always did well in math class, so it seemed like a natural fit.
 
But I was concerned. In high school I’d been in the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad training program, and there I’d met kids who were clearly much much better at math than I was. In retrospect, I don’t think I was as bad as I’d thought at the time: there were 24 kids in the program, and I was probably around #20, if that, but I think a lot of the other kids had more practice working on “math olympiad”-type problems. Maybe I was really something like the tenth-best in the group.
 
Tenth-best or twentieth-best, whatever it was, I reached a crisis of confidence around my sophomore or junior year in college. At MIT, I started right off taking advanced math classes, and somewhere along the way I realized I wasn’t seeing the big picture. I was able to do the homework pr</p><p>3 0.17945828 <a title="236-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood_in_the_math_curriculum.html">992 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood in the math curriculum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>3 0.82682395 <a title="236-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood_in_the_math_curriculum.html">992 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood in the math curriculum</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In response to some big new push for testing schoolchildren, Mark Palko  writes :
  
The announcement of a new curriculum is invariably followed by a round of hearty round of self congratulations and talk of “keeping standards high” as if adding a slide to a PowerPoint automatically made students better informed. It doesn’t work that way. Adding a topic to the list simply means that students will be exposed to it, not that they will understand or master or retain it.
  
Well put.  In my own teaching, I often am tempted to believe that just putting a topic in a homework problem is enough to ensure that students will learn it.  But it doesn’t work that way.  Even if they manage to somehow struggle through and solve the problem (and many don’t, or they rely on their friends’ solutions), they won’t learn much if they don’t see the connection with everything else they know.

<p>Introduction: I’m not a great teacher.  I can get by because I work hard and I know a lot, and for some students my classes are just great, but it’s not a natural talent of mine.  I know people who are amazing teachers, and they have something that I just don’t have.  I wrote that book, Teaching Statistics:  A Bag of Tricks (with Deb Nolan) because I’m  not  a good teacher and hence need to develop all sorts of techniques to be able to do what good teachers can do without even trying.
 
I’m not proud of being mediocre at teaching.  I don’t think that low teaching skill is some sort of indicator that I’m a great researcher.  The other think about teaching ability is that I think it’s hard to detect without actually seeing someone teach a class.  If you see me give a seminar presentation or even a guest lecture, you’d think I’m an awesome teacher.  But, actually, no.  I’m an excellent speaker, not such a great teacher.

<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.  Anyway, I’m pa</p><p>2 0.97631806 <a title="236-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-29-Brain_Structure_and_the_Big_Five.html">490 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-29-Brain Structure and the Big Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.  Yes, there is less turnover th</p><p>4 0.96495652 <a title="236-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Forensic_bioinformatics%2C_or%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_believe_everything_you_read_in_the_%28scientific%29_papers.html">360 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Forensic bioinformatics, or, Don’t believe everything you read in the (scientific) papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.

<p>Introduction: 19. A survey is taken of students in a metropolitan area. At the first stage a school is sampled at random. The schools are divided into two strata: 20 private schools and 50 public schools are sampled. At the second stage, 5 classes are sampled within each sampled school. At the third stage, 10 students are sampled within each class. What is the probability that any given student is sampled? Express this in terms of the number of students in the class, number of classes in the school, and number of schools in the area. Define appropriate notation as needed.
 
 Solution to question 18 
 
From  yesterday :
  
18. A survey is taken of 100 undergraduates, 100 graduate students, and 100 continuing education students at a university. Assume a simple random sample within each group. Each student is asked to rate his or her satisfaction (on a 1â&euro;&ldquo;10 scale) with his or her experiences. Write the estimate and standard error of the average satisfaction of all the students at the university.

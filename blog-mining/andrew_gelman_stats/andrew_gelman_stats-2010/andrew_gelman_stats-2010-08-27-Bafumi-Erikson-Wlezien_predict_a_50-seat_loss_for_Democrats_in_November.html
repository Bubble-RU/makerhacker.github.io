The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog comments made me rethink how to express disagreement when I write.  I’ll first display my original blog entry, then some of the comments, then my reaction, and finally my new approach.  As usual with negative comments, my first reaction was to be upset, but once the hurt feelings went away, I realized that these dudes had a point.
 
 Act 1 
 
A few days I ago, I posted the following on 538:
  
Self-described “ political operative ” Les Francis, with real-world experience as former executive director of the Democratic National Committee:

 
I don’t need any polls to tell me that Republicans will do well in November. The “out” party almost always shows significant gains in the first midterm election of a new President. 
 

 Political scientists  Joe Bafumi, Bob Erikson, and Chris Wlezien, from elite, out-of-touch, ivory-tower institutions Dartmouth, Columbia, and Temple Universities:


   


Game over.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.

<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery talk sense  here .  I am perhaps too influenced by Steven Rosenstoneâ&euro;&trade;s 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections, which is the first thing I read on the topic.  In any case, I agree with Nyhan and Montgomery that the difference in vote, comparing a centrist candidate to an extreme candidate, is probably on the order of 1-2%, not the 4% that has been posited by some.
 
Among other things, ideological differences between candidates of the same party might seem big in the primaries, but then when the general election comes along, party ID becomes more important.
 
I also disagree with the model in which presidential elections are like votes for high school  prom king .</p><p>5 0.79400456 <a title="237-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.

<p>Introduction: They  write :
  
How many House seats will the Republicans gain in 2010? . . . Our methodology replicates that for our ultimately successful forecast of the 2006 midterm. Two weeks before Election Day in 2006, we posted  a prediction that the Democrats would gain 32 seats and recapture the House majority. The Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006. Our current forecast for 2010 shows that the Republicans are likely to regain the House majority. . . . the most likely scenario is  a Republican majority in the neighborhood of 229 seats versus 206 for the Democrats for a 50-seat loss for the Democrats .
  
How do they do it?  First, they predict the national two-party vote using the generic polls (asking voters which party they plan to vote for in the November congressional elections).  Then they apply the national vote swing on a district-by-district level to predict the outcome in each district.  They account for uncertainty in their predictions (I assume by using a model similar to what  Gar</p><p>2 0.88956261 <a title="237-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-21-Careers%2C_one-hit_wonders%2C_and_an_offer_of_a_free_book.html">46 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-21-Careers, one-hit wonders, and an offer of a free book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: J. Robert Lennon  writes :
  
At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest. 
  
This naturally got me thinking about statisticians.

Jarno Vanhatalo, Jaakko Riihimäki, Jouni Hartikainen, Pasi Jylänki, Ville Tolvanen, and Aki Vehtari  write :
  
The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

I was wondering if multilevel models can be used as an alternative to 2SLS or IV models to deal with (i) endogeneity and (ii) selection problems.


More concretely, I am trying to assess the impact of investment treaties on foreign investment. Aside from the fact that foreign investment is correlated over time, it may be the case that countries that already receive sufficient amounts of foreign investment need not sign treaties, and countries that sign treaties are those that need foreign investment in the first place. Countries thus “select” into treatment; treaty signing is non-random. As such, I argue that to properly estimate the impact of treaties on investment, we must model the determinants of treaty signing.


I [Teo] am currently modeling this as two separate models: (1) regress predictors on likelihood of treaty signing, (2) regress treaty (with interactions, etc) on investment (I’ve thought of using propensity score matching for this part of the model)</p><p>5 0.88207495 <a title="237-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-17-Job_opening_at_new_%E2%80%9Cbig_data%E2%80%9D_consulting_firm%21.html">1902 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-17-Job opening at new “big data” consulting firm!</a></p>

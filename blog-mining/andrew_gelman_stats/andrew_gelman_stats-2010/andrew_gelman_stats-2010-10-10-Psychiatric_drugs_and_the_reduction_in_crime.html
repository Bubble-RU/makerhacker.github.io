Does internet use trigger sex crime? We use unique Norwegian data on crime and internet adoption to shed light on this question. A public program with limited funding rolled out broadband access points in 2000-2008, and provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental variables and fixed effect estimates show that internet use is associated with a substantial increase in reported incidences of rape and other sex crimes. We present a theoretical framework that highlights three mechanisms for how internet use may affect reported sex crime, namely a reporting effect, a matching effect on potential offenders and victims, and a direct effect on crime propensity.

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen  brings up  one of my research topics:
  
In New York City, blacks make up a quarter of the population, yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects — almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.


Those statistics represent the justification for New York City’s controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters, then it ought to be young black males whom the police stop and frisk.
  
I have two comments on this.  First,  my research with Jeff Fagan and Alex Kiss  (based on data from the late 1990s, so maybe things have changed) found that the NYPD was stopping blacks and hispanics at a rate  higher  than their previous arrest rates:
  
To briefly summarize our findings, blacks and Hispanics represented 51% and 33% of the stops while representing only 26% and 24% of the New York City population.

<p>Introduction: A  NY Times Environment blog entry  summarizes an  article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  that looks into whether there really is a “scientific consensus” that humans are substantially changing the climate.  There is.  That’s pretty much “dog bites man” as far as news is concerned.  But although the results of the study don’t seem noteworthy, I was struck by this paragraph in the blog writeup, which is pretty much a quote of the PNAS article:
  
For example, of the top 50 climate researchers identified by the study (as ranked by the number of papers they had published), only 2 percent fell into the camp of climate dissenters. Of the top 200 researchers, only 2.5 percent fell into the dissenter camp. That is consistent with past work, including opinion polls, suggesting that 97 to 98 percent of working climate scientists accept the evidence for human-induced climate change.
  
Two percent of the top 50, that’s one person.  And 2.5 percent of the top 200, that’s five</p><p>6 0.75623149 <a title="333-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-25-An_interesting_but_flawed_attempt_to_apply_general_forecasting_principles_to_contextualize_attitudes_toward_risks_of_global_warming.html">2112 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-25-An interesting but flawed attempt to apply general forecasting principles to contextualize attitudes toward risks of global warming</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>2 0.93707681 <a title="333-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-Math_Talks_%3A%3A_Action_Movies.html">1617 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-Math Talks :: Action Movies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Goodman  gave the  departmental seminar  yesterday (10 Dec 2012) and I was amused by an extended analogy he made.  After his (very clear) intro, he said that math talks were like action movies.  The overall theorem and its applications provide the plot, and the proofs provide the action scenes.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90615869 <a title="333-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-10-Psychiatric_drugs_and_the_reduction_in_crime.html">333 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-10-Psychiatric drugs and the reduction in crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.
  
My reply:
 
I know what you mean.  The story seems plausible but the statistical analysis seems like a stretch.  I appreciate that the authors included scatterplots of their data, but the patterns they</p><p>4 0.89934611 <a title="333-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-13-Against_the_myth_of_the_heroic_visualization.html">1896 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-13-Against the myth of the heroic visualization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.
 
I would like to echo Cairo’</p><p>5 0.89843595 <a title="333-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-07-My_contribution_to_the_discussion_on_%E2%80%9CShould_voting_be_mandatory%3F%E2%80%9D.html">997 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-07-My contribution to the discussion on “Should voting be mandatory?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My short answer (based on the research of Leighley and Nagler):
  
Whether or not mandatory voting is a good idea, I think it’s unlikely to happen at a national level. Even setting aside the practical difficulties of taking a now-voluntary action and making it compulsory, bringing in the other half of the potential electorate would change the political conversation so much that it’s hard for me to see current officeholders supporting such a plan.

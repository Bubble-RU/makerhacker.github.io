<p>Introduction: Brayden King  points  to  this page  of materials on sociologist Erving Goffman.  Whenever I’ve read about Goffman, it always seems to be in conjunction with some story about his bad behavior–in that respect, King’s link above does not disappoint.  In the absence of any context, it all seems mysterious to me  Once or twice I’ve tried to read passages in books by Goffman but have never manage to get through any of it.  (This is not mean as any kind of criticism, it’s just a statement of my lack of knowledge.)  I was amused enough by the stories reported by King that I clicked through to the Biographical Materials section of the Goffman page and read a few.  I still couldn’t really quite get the point, though, perhaps in part because I only know one of the many people on that list.</p><p>3 0.079437524 <a title="415-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m postponing today’s scheduled post (“Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models”) to continue the lively discussion from yesterday,  What if I were to stop publishing in journals? . 
   
 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.06699606 <a title="415-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-11-Yes%2C_worry_about_generalizing_from_data_to_population.__But_multilevel_modeling_is_the_solution%2C_not_the_problem.html">1934 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-11-Yes, worry about generalizing from data to population.

<p>Introduction: A sociologist writes in:
  
Samuel Lucas has just published  a paper  in Quality and Quantity arguing that anything less than a full probability sample of higher levels in HLMs yields biased and unusable results. If I follow him correctly, he is arguing that not only are the SEs too small, but the parameter estimates themselves are biased and we cannot say in advance whether the bias is positive or negative.


Lucas has thrown down a big gauntlet, advising us throw away our data unless the sample of macro units is right and ignore the published results that fail this standard. Extreme. 
Is there another conclusion to be drawn? 
Other advice to be given? 
A Bayesian path out of the valley?
  
Heres’s the abstract to Lucas’s paper:
  
The multilevel model has become a staple of social research.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>3 0.81178135 <a title="415-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-15-How_effective_are_football_coaches%3F.html">1804 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-15-How effective are football coaches?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>4 0.80812681 <a title="415-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-15-Outta_control_political_incorrectness.html">1578 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-15-Outta control political incorrectness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.
 
I’m reminded of a bizarrely-retro  remark  from a couple years ago by Colin (“at age 22″) Camerer.  In response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer said:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.  When learning science, we sometimes speak</p><p>6 0.77460265 <a title="415-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-10-The_recursion_of_pop-econ.html">1850 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-10-The recursion of pop-econ</a></p>

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.


VIII. If you want to share a copy of this image, please ask first. If you want a real copy, you can ask about that too.

<p>Introduction: Washington Post and Slate reporter Anne Applebaum wrote a  dismissive  column about Wikileaks, saying that they “offer nothing more than raw data.”
 
Applebaum argues that “The notion that the Internet can replace traditional news-gathering has just been revealed to be a myth. . . . without more journalism, more investigation, more work, these documents just don’t matter that much.”
 
Fine.  But don’t undervalue the role of mere data!  The usual story is that we  don’t  get to see the raw data underlying newspaper stories.  Wikileaks and other crowdsourced data can be extremely useful, whether or not they replace “traditional news-gathering.”</p><p>4 0.94334167 <a title="415-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-31-Watercolor_regression.html">1478 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-31-Watercolor regression</a></p>

Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.


2. You and your readers didn’t like that the edges of the filled CI were so sharp and arbitrary.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

I saw  a post  on Andrew Sullivan’s blog today about life expectancy in different US counties. With a bunch of the worst counties being in Mississippi, I thought that it might be another case of analysts getting extreme values from small counties.


However, the paper (see  here ) includes a pretty interesting methods section. This is from page 5, “Specifically, we used a mixed-effects Poisson regression with time, geospatial, and covariate components. Poisson regression fits count outcome variables, e.g., death counts, and is preferable to a logistic model because the latter is biased when an outcome is rare (occurring in less than 1% of observations).”


They have downloadable data. I believe that the data are predicted values from the model. A web appendix also gives 90% CIs for their estimates.


Do you think they solved the small county problem and that the worst counties really are where their spreadsheet suggests?

What they did right:


- Did not put the data on a map 
- Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically 
- Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel 
- Only used three labels for the 11 years on the plot 
- Did not overdo the vertical scale either


The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go. I would have used smaller fonts throughout.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s comments. I could even add a few more, like using light gray for the backgrounds and a bright blue for the lines, spacing the graphs well, using full country names rather than three-letter abbreviations.

I was recently in a conversation with some colleagues regarding the evaluation of recent welfare reform in California. The discussion centered around what types of design might allow us to understand the impact the changes. Experimental designs were out, as random assignment is not feasible. Our data is pre/post, and some of my colleagues believed that the best we can do under these circumstance was a descriptive study; i.e. no causal inference. All of us were concerned with changes in economic and population changes over the pre-to-post period; i.e. over-estimating the effects in an improving economy. 


I was thought a quasi-experimental design was possible using MLM. Briefly, my suggestion was the following:


Match our post-participants to a set of pre-participants on relevant person level factors, and treat the pre/post differences as a random effect at the county level.

I am experimenting with the mapping/visualization of survey response data, with a particular focus on using transparency to convey uncertainty. See some examples  here .


Do you think the examples are successful at communicating both local values of the variable of interest, as well as the lack of information in certain places? Also, do you have any general advice for choosing an approach to spatially smoothing the data in a way that preserves local features, but prevents individual respondents from standing out? I have experimented a lot with smoothing in these maps, and the cost of preventing the Midwest and West from looking “spotty” is the oversmoothing of the Northeast.
  
My quick impression is that the graphs are more pretty than they are informative.  But “pretty” is not such a bad thing!  The conveying-information part is more difficult:  to me, the graphs seem to be displaying a somewhat confusing mix of opinion level and population density.

<p>Introduction: Robert Gonzalez  reports  on some  beautiful graphs  from John Nelson. Here’s Nelson:
 
 
         The sexes start out homogenous, go super segregated in the teen years, segregate for business in the twenty-somethings, and re-couple for co-habitation years.  Then the lights fade into faint pockets of pink.   
 
  
I [Nelson] am using simple tract-level population/gender counts from the US Census Bureau. Because their tract boundaries extend into the water and vacant area, I used NYC’s Bytes of the Big Apple zoning shapes to clip the census tracts to residentially zoned areas -giving me a more realistic (and more recognizable) definition of populated areas. The census breaks out their population counts by gender for five-year age spans ranging from teeny tiny infants through esteemed 85+ year-olds.
  
And here’s Gonzalez:

I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years.

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).

<p>Introduction: One can quibble about the best way to display county-level unemployment data on a map, since a small, populous county gets much less visual weight than a large, sparsely populated one.  Even so, I think we can agree that  this animated map by LaToya Egwuekwe  is pretty cool.  It says it shows the unemployment rate by county, as a function of time, but anyone with even the slightest knowledge of what happens during a zombie attack will recognize it for what it is.</p><p>2 0.79378879 <a title="182-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Gregor_Mendel%E2%80%99s_suspicious_data.html">1449 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Gregor Mendel’s suspicious data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points me to a  thoughtful discussion  by Moti Nissani on “Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox.”
 
The paradox, as Nissani defines it, is that Mendel’s data seem in many cases too good to be true, yet Mendel had a reputation for probity and it seems doubtful that he had a Mark-Hauser-style attitude toward reporting scientific data.  Nissani writes:
  
Taken together, the situation seems paradoxical. On the one hand, we have evidence that “the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel’s expectations.” We also have good reasons to believe that Mendel encountered linkage but failed to report it and that he may have taken the somewhat unusual step of having his scientific records destroyed shortly after his death. On the other hand, everything else we know about him/in addition to his undisputed genius/suggests a man of unimpeachable integrity, fine observational powers, and a pa</p><p>3 0.74662507 <a title="182-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert_update%3A__cartooning_can_give_you_the_strength_to_open_jars_with_your_bare_hands.html">664 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert update:  cartooning can give you the strength to open jars with your bare hands</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>4 0.70248932 <a title="182-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-19-Thiel_update.html">525 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-19-Thiel update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.


Firstly, just because someone is a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, or any kind of successful entrepreneur for that matter, doesn’t mean they should be trusted with oth</p><p>5 0.68656838 <a title="182-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-26-Antman_again_courts_controversy.html">973 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-26-Antman again courts controversy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>6 0.68179011 <a title="182-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-In_today%E2%80%99s_economy%2C_the_rich_get_richer.html">367 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-In today’s economy, the rich get richer</a></p>

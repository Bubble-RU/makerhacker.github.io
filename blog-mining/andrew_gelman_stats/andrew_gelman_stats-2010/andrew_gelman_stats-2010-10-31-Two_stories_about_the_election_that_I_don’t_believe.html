[sent-4, score-0.368]
</p><p>2 I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are misleading:  When things are going well, your message is going to sound good; when things aren’t going so well, it doesn’t matter much how you spin things. [sent-15, score-0.315]
</p><p>3 Baker recognizes this:  “the debate has taken on particular resonance in a time of economic distress. [sent-16, score-0.296]
</p><p>4 ”  To put it another way, I disagree that the battle of elitism is “at the core of the nation’s debate this fall. [sent-17, score-0.764]
</p><p>5 ”  I think it would be more accurate to say that economic policy and outcomes are at the core of the debate, and “elitism” is just being attached to that debate. [sent-18, score-0.345]
</p><p>6 Here’s the second story I’m not thrilled with, this time from  Jonathan Chait  in the New Republic:    Republicans are going to gain a lot of seats in the midterm elections. [sent-21, score-0.358]
</p><p>7 Political punditry has been saturated with arguments interpreting this result as a verdict of sorts on the Obama administration. [sent-23, score-0.243]
</p><p>8 Liberals are interpreting the incipient GOP win on poor communication or perhaps timid policies by the Democrats. [sent-24, score-0.457]
</p><p>9 Conservatives are interpreting it as the natural punishment for a party that moved too far left. [sent-25, score-0.237]
</p><p>10 Clearly, in the current environment, it’s not rational to expect the majority party to escape any losses whatsoever. [sent-31, score-0.28]
</p><p>11 If you want to blame the Democrats’ loss on bad messaging or wimpy policies or rampaging socialism, then you need to establish how you’d expect them to do given normal messaging and policies. [sent-32, score-0.878]
</p><p>12 Chait then discusses Doug Hibbs’s model, featured on this blog  before , which predicts midterm election outcomes given incumbency, the current distribution of House seats, and recent economic performance. [sent-33, score-0.547]
</p><p>13 From Paul Krugman on the left to Casey Mulligan on the right, commenters have been arguing that the governing party  can  make a difference. [sent-38, score-0.298]
</p><p>14 Whether it’s Kruguman recommending a larger stimulus or Mulligan saying the government should avoid intervention into the financial sector, the claim is that that the economy could be doing better (or worse). [sent-39, score-0.292]
</p><p>15 ”   Or, to put it another way, I think it’s perfectly reasonable for liberals to interpret some of the current state of the economy, and thus the predicted election outcome, to “timid policies by the Democrats. [sent-41, score-0.541]
</p><p>16 Similarly, why shouldn’t conservatives think that the current economic doldrums are partly explained by the Democrats’ policies, from regulation to stimulus to health care? [sent-43, score-0.477]
</p><p>17 Republicans have been making this argument for awhile, that these activist government policies are counterproductive. [sent-44, score-0.2]
</p><p>18 He’s right that elections are largely determined by the fundamentals, but he’s wrong to think that the governing party has no effect on the economy. [sent-48, score-0.291]
</p><p>19 )  To say that the fundamentals matter, that the economy is key, is not the same as saying that the president and Congress can’t influence elections. [sent-51, score-0.251]
</p><p>20 Or, if it was, a lot of people were wasting their time arguing about the macroeconomic consequences of the stimulus, the bailouts, the deficit, the tax cuts, etc etc etc. [sent-53, score-0.275]

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>3 0.29289699 <a title="384-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan_Chait_and_I_agree_about_the_importance_of_the_fundamentals_in_determining_presidential_elections.html">656 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan Chait and I agree about the importance of the fundamentals in determining presidential elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Johathan Chait  writes :
  
 Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. 
  
I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstone’s excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on “The G.O.P.’s Dukakis Problem”?
 
I’ll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that I’m happy with Chait’s quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where I’m coming from but my take-home point is that we’re mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010.

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>5 0.88650221 <a title="384-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-14-Is_it_1930%3F.html">84 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-14-Is it 1930?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute reports:
  
Goldman Sachs’ latest forecast (and they’ve been pretty accurate so far) is that unemployment will rise to 9.9% by early 2011 and trend down to 9.7% for the last quarter of 2011. Obviously, this is a simply awful scenario but it seems one that is being accepted. That is, we seem to be in the process of accepting the unacceptable. Note that this scenario probably assumes the passage of the limited efforts now being considered in Congress.
  
One might be surprised that Obama and congressional Democrats are not doing more to try to bring unemployment down.  On the other hand, just to speak in generalities (not knowing any of the people involved), I would think that Obama would be much much more worried about the economy doing well in 2010 and then crashing in 2012.  A crappy economy through 2011 and then improvement in 2012–that would be his ideal, no?  Not that he would have the ability to time this sort of thing.

<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>2 0.94303846 <a title="384-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-16-%E2%80%9CFor_individuals_with_wine_training%2C_however%2C_we_find__indications_of_a_positive_relationship_between_price_and_enjoyment%E2%80%9D.html">470 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-16-“For individuals with wine training, however, we find  indications of a positive relationship between price and enjoyment”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this blog post quotes the second line of the abstract of Goldstein et al.’s much ballyhooed 2008 tech report,  Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?  Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings .  
 
The first sentence of the abstract is
  

Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.

  
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the easy target wine snobs make, the popular press has picked up on the first sentence of the tech report.  For example, the  Freakonomics blog/radio entry  of the same name quotes the first line, ignores the qualification, then concludes
  

Wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons, and urging you to spend $15 instead of $50 on your next bottle of wine. Go ahead, take the money you save and blow it on the lottery.

  
In case you’re wondering about whether to buy me a cheap or expensive bottle of wine, keep in mind I’ve had classical “wine training”.

<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
  
Just to throw some Richard Florida in the mix:  Back in 1990, I  turned down  a job offer from Bell Labs, larg</p><p>4 0.9390921 <a title="384-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-02-Bill_James_and_the_base-rate_fallacy.html">642 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-02-Bill James and the base-rate fallacy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was recently rereading and enjoying Bill James’s Historical Baseball Abstract (the second edition, from 2001).
 
But even the Master is not perfect.  Here he is, in the context of the all-time 20th-greatest shortstop (in his reckoning):
  
Are athletes special people?  In general, no, but occasionally, yes.  Johnny Pesky at 75 was trim, youthful, optimistic, and practically exploding with energy.  You rarely meet anybody like that who  isn’t  an ex-athlete–and that makes athletes seem special. [italics in the original]
  
Hey, I’ve met 75-year-olds like that–and none of them are ex-athletes!  That’s probably because I don’t know a lot of ex-athletes.  But Bill James . . . he knows a lot of athletes.  He went to the bathroom with Tim Raines once!  The most I can say is that I saw Rickey Henderson steal a couple bases when he was playing against the Orioles once.

<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on.

I am scientist needing to model a treatment effect on a population of ~500 people.  The dependent variable in the model is the difference in a person’s pre-treatment 12 month total medical cost versus post-treatment cost.  So there is large variation in costs, but not so much by using the difference between the pre and post treatment costs.  The issue I’d like some advice on is that the treatment has already occurred so there is no possibility of creating a fully randomized control now.  I do have a very large population of people to use as possible controls via propensity scoring or exact matching.  


If I had a few thousand people to possibly match, then I would use standard techniques.  However, I have a potential population of over a hundred thousand people.  An exact match of the possible controls to age, gender and region of the country still leaves a population of 10,000 controls.

<p>Introduction: Chris Blattman  writes :
  
Matching is not an identification strategy a solution to your endogeneity problem; it is a weighting scheme. Saying matching will reduce endogeneity bias is like saying that the best way to get thin is to weigh yourself in kilos. The statement makes no sense. It confuses technique with substance. . . . When you run a regression, you control for the X you can observe. When you match, you are simply matching based on those same X. . . .
  
I see what Chris is getting at–matching, like regression, won’t help for the variables you’re not controlling for–but I disagree with his characterization of matching as a weighting scheme.  I see matching as a way to restrict your analysis to comparable cases.  The statistical motivation:  robustness.  If you had a good enough model, you wouldn’t neet to match, you’d just fit the model to the data.  But in common practice we often use simple regression models and so it can be helpful to do some matching first before regress</p><p>4 0.18001547 <a title="213-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-20-The_institution_of_tenure.html">2070 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-20-The institution of tenure</a></p>

The Priceonomics blog is doing a feature where we ask a few economists what they think of the the institution of tenure. If you’d be interested in participating, I’d love to get your response.


As an economist, what do you think of tenure? Should it be abolished / kept / modified?
  
My reply:  Just to be clear, I’m assuming that when you say “tenure,” you’re talking about lifetime employment for college professors such as myself.
 
I’m actually a political scientist, not an economist.  So rather than giving my opinion, I’ll say what I think an economist might say.
 
I think an economist could say one of two things:
 
Economist as anthropologist would say:  Tenure is decided by independent institutions acting freely.  If they choose to offer tenure, they will have good reasons, and it is not part of an economist’s job to second-guess individual decisions.
 
Economist as McKinsey consultant would say: Tenure can be evaluated based on a cost-benefit analysis.

<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?
 
In the meantime, if anybody feels like setting up a wikipedia entry for the research of Columbia’s statistics faculty, that</p><p>6 0.15150981 <a title="213-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-02-Covariate_Adjustment_in_RCT_-_Model_Overfitting_in_Multilevel_Regression.html">936 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-02-Covariate Adjustment in RCT - Model Overfitting in Multilevel Regression</a></p>

We have been discussing the following two issues amongst ourselves, then with our methodological consultant for several days. However, we have not been able to arrive at a consensus. Consequently, we decided to seek an opinion from nationally known experts. FYI, we sent a similar inquiry to Larry Hedges and David Rogosa . . .  


1)      We are wondering if a post-hoc covariate adjustment is a good practice in the context of RCTs [randomized clinical trials]. We have a situation where we found a significant baseline difference between the treatment and the control groups in 3 variables. Some of us argue that adding those three variables to the original impact analysis model is a good idea, as that would remove the confound from the impact estimate. Others among us, on the other hand, argue that a post-hoc covariate adjustment should never be done, on the ground that those covariates are correlated with the treatment, which makes the analysis model that of quasi</p><p>4 0.74493939 <a title="213-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-18-Lack_of_complete_overlap.html">1017 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-18-Lack of complete overlap</a></p>

I have a question regarding a randomizing constraint in my current funded electricity experiment. 


After elimination of missing data we have 110 voluntary households from a larger population (resource constraints do not allow us to have more households!). I randomly assign them to threated and non treated where the treatment variable is some ICT that allows the treated to track their electricity consumption in real tim. The ICT is made of two devices, one that is plugged on the household’s modem and the other on the electric meter. A necessary condition for being treated is that the distance between the box and the meter be below some threshold (d), the value of which is 20 meters approximately. 


50 ICTs can be installed. 
60 households will be in the control group.


But, I can only assign 6 households in the control group for whom d is less than 20.

Both studies are based around the population of adults in LA who attended LA public high schools at some point, so that is the same for both studies.  Study #1 uses random digit dialing, so I consider that one to be SRS.  Study #2, however, is a convenience sample in which all participants were involved with one of eight community-based organizations (CBOs).


Of course, both studies can be analyzed independently, but she was hoping for there to be some way to combine/compare the two studies.

We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

<p>Introduction: Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute reports:
  
Goldman Sachs’ latest forecast (and they’ve been pretty accurate so far) is that unemployment will rise to 9.9% by early 2011 and trend down to 9.7% for the last quarter of 2011. Obviously, this is a simply awful scenario but it seems one that is being accepted. That is, we seem to be in the process of accepting the unacceptable. Note that this scenario probably assumes the passage of the limited efforts now being considered in Congress.
  
One might be surprised that Obama and congressional Democrats are not doing more to try to bring unemployment down.  On the other hand, just to speak in generalities (not knowing any of the people involved), I would think that Obama would be much much more worried about the economy doing well in 2010 and then crashing in 2012.  A crappy economy through 2011 and then improvement in 2012–that would be his ideal, no?  Not that he would have the ability to time this sort of thing.

Ed Vul and I are working on something that, although less exciting than the struggle against voodoo correlations in fMRI :-) might interest you and your readers.  The background is this:  we have been struck for a long time by how many people get frustrated and confused trying to figure out whether something they are doing/eating/etc is triggering something bad, whether it be migraine headaches, children’s tantrums, arthritis pains, or whatever. It seems crazy to try to do such computations in one’s head–and the psychological literature suggests people must be pretty bad at this kind of thing–but what’s the alternative?  We are trying to develop one alternative approach–starting with migraine as a pilot project.


We created  a website  that migraine sufferers can sign up for. The users select a list of factors that they think might be triggering their headaches (eg drinking red wine, eating stinky cheese, etc.–the website suggests a big list of candidates drawn</p><p>6 0.96921569 <a title="213-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-21-%E2%80%9CReadability%E2%80%9D_as_freedom_from_the_actual_sensation_of_reading.html">1179 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-21-“Readability” as freedom from the actual sensation of reading</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.  Yes, there is less turnover th</p><p>3 0.16287693 <a title="26-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-11-The_unitary_nature_of_consciousness%3A__%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s_impossible_to_be_insanely_frustrated_about_2_things_at_once%E2%80%9D.html">1375 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-11-The unitary nature of consciousness:  “It’s impossible to be insanely frustrated about 2 things at once”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes:
  
We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>5 0.12163977 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-16-%E2%80%9CIt_doesn%E2%80%99t_matter_if_you_believe_in_God.__What_matters_is_if_God_believes_in_you.%E2%80%9D.html">715 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-16-“It doesn’t matter if you believe in God.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>6 0.11140989 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-28-The_Supreme_Court%E2%80%99s_Many_Median_Justices.html">1234 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-28-The Supreme Court’s Many Median Justices</a></p>

I [Kahan] could cite to billions of interesting papers, but I’ll just show you what I mean instead. A recent CCP data collection involving a nationally representative on-line sample of 1750 subjects included a module that asked the subjects to indicate on a six-point scale “how strongly . . . you support or oppose” a collection of policies:  


policy_gun  Stricter gun control laws in the United States. 
policy_healthcare  Universal health care. 
policy_taxcut  Raising income taxes for persons in the highest-income tax bracket.

<p>Introduction: Several people have asked me what I thought of  this .  For example, one colleague wrote:
  
I thought you might find data of this quantity and quality as interesting as I do.


In their latest blog entry, okcupid uses its very large dating-site userbase to assess the progression of social and economic views with age, and (taking into account self-specified importance of economic and social views) the resulting political affiliations.  The final assessment is that the spectrum of views encompassed under “democrat” ends up being much broader than those under “republican”.  I’ve seen this mentioned many times before, but I have never seen such pretty data illustrating the phenomenon.  Perhaps this is more graphics to impress, rather than graphics in a typical statistical setting, but I find them captivating nonetheless. In any case, I would be curious to hear your opinions of this.

<p>Introduction: When Sonia Sotomayor was nominated for the Supreme Court, and there was some discussion of having 6 Roman Catholics on the court at the same time, I  posted  the following historical graph:
 
 
 
It’s time for an update:
 
 
 
It’s still gonna take awhile for the Catholics to catch up. . . .
 
And this one might be relevant too:
 
 
 
It looks as if Jews and men have been overrepresented, also  Episcopalians  (which, as I noted earlier, are not necessarily considered Protestant in terms of religious doctrine but which I counted as such for the ethnic categorization).  Religion is an interesting political variable because it’s nominally about religious belief but typically seems to be more about ethnicity.</p><p>3 0.80405045 <a title="26-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-15-When_Does_a_Name_Become_Androgynous%3F.html">208 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-15-When Does a Name Become Androgynous?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).


 Design:  Randomized clinica</p><p>6 0.7484467 <a title="26-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-18-Course_proposal%3A_Bayesian_and_advanced_likelihood_statistical_methods_for_zombies..html">96 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-18-Course proposal: Bayesian and advanced likelihood statistical methods for zombies.</a></p>

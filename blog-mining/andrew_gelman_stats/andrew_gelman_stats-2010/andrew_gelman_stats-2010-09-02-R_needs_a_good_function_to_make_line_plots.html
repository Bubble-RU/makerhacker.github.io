<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: After I spoke tonight at the NYC R meetup, John Myles White and Drew Conway told me about  this competition  they’re administering for developing a recommendation system for R packages.  They seem to have already done some work laying out the network of R packages–which packages refer to which others, and so forth.
 
I just hope they set up their system so that my own packages (“R2WinBUGS”, “r2jags”, “arm”, and “mi”) get recommended automatically.  I really hate to think that there are people out there running regressions in R and not using display() and coefplot() to look at the output.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.

<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>6 0.72941011 <a title="252-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-17-Is_chartjunk_really_%E2%80%9Cmore_useful%E2%80%9D_than_plain_graphs%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_so..html">37 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-17-Is chartjunk really “more useful” than plain graphs?

<p>Introduction: More and more I’m thinking that line plots are great.  More specifically, two-way grids of line plots on common scales, with one, two, or three lines per plot (enough to show comparisons but not so many that you can’t tell the lines apart).  Also dot plots, of the sort that have been masterfully used by Lax and Phillips to show comparisons and trends in support for gay rights.
 
There’s a big step missing, though, and that is to be able to make these graphs as a default.  We have to figure out the right way to structure the data so these graphs come naturally.
 
Then when it’s all working, we can talk the Excel people into implementing our ideas.  I’m not asking to be paid here; all our ideas are in the public domain and I’m happy for Microsoft or Google or whoever to copy us.

Some years ago, after I gave a talk at Columbia that you attended, you told me that you would like to see a decision-theoretic analysis formulated and carried out to completion by Donald Berry, who had been quite vocal for some time about the importance of such a “fully Bayesian” analysis.


I do not work with Berry.  But, in recent years  I have begun to do utility-based clinical trial design.  The trial described in  the attached paper  [by Thall and Hoang Nguyen] enrolled its first child very recently.  While the methodology is not terribly sophisticated, I consider this to be one of the most ethical trials that I have designed.  The utility was elicited from the two trial PIs.  When we had the pre-trial start-up meeting, a third oncologist looked hard at the utility table, and he said that he agreed completely with the numerical utilities. 


I doubt that this trial will cure this type of brain tumor, but I do think that the design gives the children a better</p><p>3 0.92731464 <a title="252-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-24-Latest_in_blog_advertising.html">1080 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-24-Latest in blog advertising</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following message from “Patricia Lopez” of “Premium Link Ads”:
  
Hello,


I am interested in placing a text link on your page: http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/. The link would point to a page on a website that is relevant to your page and may be useful to your site visitors. We would be happy to compensate you for your time if it is something we are able to work out.


The best way to reach me is through a direct response to this email. This will help me get back to you about the right link request. Please let me know if you are interested, and if not thanks for your time. Thanks.
  
Usually I just ignore these, but after our recent  discussion  I decided to reply.  I wrote:
  
How much do you pay?
  
But no answer.  I wonder what’s going on?  I mean, why bother sending the email in the first place if you’re not going to follow up?</p><p>4 0.92688549 <a title="252-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis_testing_with_multiple_imputations.html">799 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis testing with multiple imputations</a></p>

I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution? Do I combine the 5 imputed data set into one by averaging each imputed values so I get one single imputed data and compare with the ob</p><p>5 0.92626643 <a title="252-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-23-A_statistical_version_of_Arrow%E2%80%99s_paradox.html">586 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-23-A statistical version of Arrow’s paradox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, when we deal with scientists, statisticians are often put in a setting reminiscent of Arrow’s paradox, where we are asked to provide estimates that are informative and unbiased and confidence statements that are correct conditional on the data and also on the underlying true parameter. [It's not generally possible for an estimate to do all these things at the same time -- ed.]  Larry Wasserman feels that scientists are truly frequentist, and Don Rubin has told me how he feels that scientists interpret all statistical estimates Bayesianly. I have no doubt that both Larry and Don are correct. Voters want lower taxes and more services, and scientists want both Bayesian and frequency coverage; as the saying goes, everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.</p><p>6 0.92568922 <a title="252-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs_in_information_graphics.html">1584 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs in information graphics</a></p>

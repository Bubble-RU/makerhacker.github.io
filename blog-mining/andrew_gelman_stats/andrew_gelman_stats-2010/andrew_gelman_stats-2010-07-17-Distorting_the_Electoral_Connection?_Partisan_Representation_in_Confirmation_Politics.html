<p>Introduction: On the basis of two papers and because it is completely obvious, we (meaning  me , Justin, and  John ) predict that Elena Kagan will get confirmed to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  But we also want to see how close we can come to predicting the votes for and against.
 
We actually have two sets of predictions, both using the MRP technique discussed previously on this blog.  The first is based on our  recent paper  in the  Journal of Politics  showing that support for the nominee in a senator’s home state plays a striking role in whether she or he votes to confirm the nominee.  The second is based on a  new working paper  extending “basic” MRP to show that senators respond far more to their co-partisans than the median voter in their home states.  Usually, our vote “predictions” do not differ much, but there is a group of senators who are predicted to vote yes for Kagan with a probability around 50% and the two sets of predictions thus differ for Kagan more than usual.</p><p>3 0.1969354 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-03-The_Employment_Nondiscrimination_Act_is_overwhelmingly_popular_in_nearly_every_one_of_the_50_states.html">2087 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-03-The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is overwhelmingly popular in nearly every one of the 50 states</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above graph shows the estimated support, by state, for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a gay rights bill that the Senate will be voting on this Monday.  The estimates were constructed by Kate Krimmel, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips using multilevel regression and poststratification.
 
Check out that graph again.  The scale goes from 20% to 80%, but  every state  is in the yellow-to-red range.  Support for a law making it illegal to discriminate against gays has majority support in every state. And in most states the support is very strong.
 
And  here’s the research paper  by Krimmel, Lax, and Phillips, which begins:
  
Public majorities have supported several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress has responded slowly if at all. We address this puzzle through dyadic analysis of the opinion- vote relationship on 23 roll-call votes between 1993 and 2010, matching members of Congress to policy-specific opinion in their state or district.

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.  Yes, there is less turnover th</p><p>5 0.13158037 <a title="152-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-28-The_Supreme_Court%E2%80%99s_Many_Median_Justices.html">1234 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-28-The Supreme Court’s Many Median Justices</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Lauderdale and Tom Clark wrote  a paper  in which they modeled Supreme Court judges as having different relative positions on different issues.
 
Here’s an illustration of what their model does:

It started when Jeff Lax made  this comment  on his recent blog entry:
  
 Nebraska Is All That Counts for a Party-Bucking Nelson 


Dem Senator On Blowback From His Opposition To Kagan: ‘Are They From Nebraska? Then I Don’t Care’


Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…
  
I conferred with Jeff and then wrote the following entry for fivethirtyeight.com.  There was a backlog of posts at 538 at the time, so I set it on delay to appear the following morning.

<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science—and soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It’s taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power—as well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.
 
As a method becomes used more and more widely, there will be natural concerns about its domains of applicability.  That is the subject of the pres</p><p>6 0.68903983 <a title="152-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-14-More_on_Mister_P_and_how_it_does_what_it_does.html">2061 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-14-More on Mister P and how it does what it does</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>3 0.9044165 <a title="152-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Baby_name_wizards.html">720 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Baby name wizards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I noticed a car with the improbable name of Nissan Rogue, from Darien, Connecticut (at least that’s what the license plate frame said).  And, after all, what could be more “rogue”-like than a suburban SUV?
 
I can’t blame the driver of the car for this one; I’m just amused that the marketers and Nissan thought this was an appropriate name for the car.</p><p>4 0.87458038 <a title="152-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-04-Inequality_and_health.html">127 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-04-Inequality and health</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The above graph shows the estimated support, by state, for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a gay rights bill that the Senate will be voting on this Monday.  The estimates were constructed by Kate Krimmel, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips using multilevel regression and poststratification.
 
Check out that graph again.  The scale goes from 20% to 80%, but  every state  is in the yellow-to-red range.  Support for a law making it illegal to discriminate against gays has majority support in every state. And in most states the support is very strong.
 
And  here’s the research paper  by Krimmel, Lax, and Phillips, which begins:
  
Public majorities have supported several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress has responded slowly if at all. We address this puzzle through dyadic analysis of the opinion- vote relationship on 23 roll-call votes between 1993 and 2010, matching members of Congress to policy-specific opinion in their state or district. We also extend the MRP opinion e</p><p>6 0.75927991 <a title="152-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-21-2.15.html">1773 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-21-2.15</a></p>

As if you don’t have enough to do, I thought you might be interested in blogging on this.
  
My reply:
 
I thought Kaiser’s discussion was good, especially this point:
  
Effect on treatment group = Effect of the drug + effect of belief in being treated


Effect on placebo group = Effect of belief in being treated


Thus, the difference between the two groups = effect of the drug, since the effect of belief in being treated affects both groups of patients.
  
Thus, as Kaiser puts it, if the treatment isn’t doing better than placebo, it doesn’t say that the placebo effect is big (let alone “too big”) but that the treatment isn’t showing any additional effect.  It’s “treatment + placebo” vs. placebo, not treatment vs. placebo.

What makes the designer want to tilt the reader’s head?


This chart is unreadable. It also fails the self-sufficiency test. All 13 data points are printed onto the chart. You really don’t need the axis, and the gridlines.


A further design flaw is the use of signposts. Our eyes are drawn to the hexagons containing the brand icons but the data is at the other end of the signpost, where it is planted on the surface!


Here is a sketch of something not as cute:


 


I [Kaiser] expressed time as years . . . The mobile-related entities are labelled red. The dots could be replaced by the hexagonal brand icons.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s criticisms, and I agree that his graph is, from the statistical perspective, a zillion times better than what was published. On the other hand, unusual images can get attention. Recall the famous/notorious clock plot from  Florence Nightingale .

The Sept 2009 issue of Wired had a  big article  on the increase in the placebo effect, and why it’s been getting bigger.


Kaiser Fung has a  synopsis .


As if you don’t have enough to do, I thought you might be interested in blogging on this.
  
My reply:
 
I thought Kaiser’s discussion was good, especially this point:
  
Effect on treatment group = Effect of the drug + effect of belief in being treated


Effect on placebo group = Effect of belief in being treated


Thus, the difference between the two groups = effect of the drug, since the effect of belief in being treated affects both groups of patients.
  
Thus, as Kaiser puts it, if the treatment isn’t doing better than placebo, it doesn’t say that the placebo effect is big (let alone “too big”) but that the treatment isn’t showing any additional effect.  It’s “treatment + placebo” vs. placebo, not treatment vs. placebo.
 
That said, I’d prefer for Kaiser to make it clear that the additivity he’s assu</p><p>2 0.87937725 <a title="388-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-20-Prior_beliefs_about_locations_of_decision_boundaries.html">1130 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-20-Prior beliefs about locations of decision boundaries</a></p>

I want to incorporate a prior belief into an estimation of a logistic regression classifier of points distributed in a 2d space. My prior belief is a funny kind of prior though. It’s a belief about where the decision boundary between classes should fall. Over the 2d space, I lay a grid, and I believe that a decision boundary that separates any two classes should fall along any of the grid line with some probablity, and that the decision boundary should fall anywhere except a gridline with a much lower probability.  


For the two class case, and a logistic regression model parameterized by W and data X, my prior could perhaps be expressed  


Pr(W) = (normalizing constant)/exp(d) where d = f(grid,W,X) such that when logistic(W^TX)= .5 and X is ‘far’ from grid lines, then d is large. Have you ever seen a model like this, or do you have any notions about a good avenue to pursue?

<p>Introduction: Sciencedaily has posted an article titled  Apes Unwilling to Gamble When Odds Are Uncertain :
  

The apes readily distinguished between the different probabilities of winning: they gambled a lot when there was a 100 percent chance, less when there was a 50 percent chance, and only rarely when there was no chance In some trials, however, the experimenter didn’t remove a lid from the bowl, so the apes couldn’t assess the likelihood of winning a banana The odds from the covered bowl were identical to those from the risky option: a 50 percent chance of getting the much sought-after banana. But apes of both species were less likely to choose this ambiguous option.

   

Like humans, they showed “ambiguity aversion” — preferring to gamble more when they knew the odds than when they didn’t. Given some of the other differences between chimps and bonobos, Hare and Rosati had expected to find the bonobos to be more averse to ambiguity, but that didn’t turn out to be the case.

<p>Introduction: Hear me interviewed on the topic  here .
 
P.S.  The interview was fine but I donâ&euro;&trade;t agree with everything on the linked website.  For example,  this  bit:
  
Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.  Global warming has many of the characteristics of a popular delusion, an irrational fear or cause that is embraced by millions of people because, well, it is believed by millions of people!
  
All right, then.</p><p>5 0.86111432 <a title="388-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-04-Bayesian_Learning_via_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics.html">1443 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-04-Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</a></p>

In  this paper  by Sunjin Ahn, Anoop Korattikara, and Max Welling and  this paper  by Welling and Yee Whye The, there are some arguments on big data and the use of MCMC. Both papers have suggested improvements to speed up MCMC computations. I was wondering what your thoughts were, especially on this paragraph:

 
When a dataset has a billion data-cases (as is not uncommon these days) MCMC algorithms will not even have generated a single (burn-in) sample when a clever learning algorithm based on stochastic gradients may already be making fairly good predictions. In fact, the intriguing results of Bottou and Bousquet (2008) seem to indicate that in terms of “number of bits learned per unit of computation”, an algorithm as simple as stochastic gradient descent is almost optimally efficient. We therefore argue that for Bayesian methods to remain useful in an age when the datasets grow at an exponential rate, they need to embrace the ideas of the stochastic optimiz</p><p>6 0.85853577 <a title="388-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-03-On_house_arrest_for_p-hacking.html">2049 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-03-On house arrest for p-hacking</a></p>

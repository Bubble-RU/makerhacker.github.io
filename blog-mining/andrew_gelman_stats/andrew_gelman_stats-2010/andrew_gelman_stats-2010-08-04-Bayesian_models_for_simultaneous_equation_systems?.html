I am new to Bayesian methods.  While I am reading your book, I have some questions for you.  I am interested in doing Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression (e.g., random-intercept model) and Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM)—for causality.  Do you happen to know if I could find some articles, where authors could provide data w/ R and/or BUGS codes that I could replicate them?
  
My reply:  For Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression and causal inference, see my book with Jennifer Hill.  For Bayesian structural equation modeling, try google and you’ll find some good stuff.

As I get interested in Bayesian approaches to statistics, I have one question I wondered if you would find interesting to address at some point on the blog.


What does Bayesian work look like in action across a field? From experience, I have some feeling for how ongoing debates evolve (or not) with subsequent studies in response to earlier findings. I wonder if you know how this happens in practice when multiple researchers are using Bayesian approaches. How much are previous findings built into priors? How much advance comes from model improvement? And in a social science field where self-selection and self-interest play a role, how are improved “treatment” effects incorporated and evaluated?


I thought you might know of a field where actual back and forth has been carried out mostly in the context of Bayesian analysis or inference, and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at an example as I think about my own field.

Thank you for fulfilling another request of mine almost two years ago. I gave you a job description of a senior Bayesian statistical software developer that I was loooking to hire.  You kindly  posted it  on your site.


THAT EVENING, I received a response from a fellow in Florida who had worked as a C++ programmer for 10+ years and — inexplicably — was now finishing his PhD in Bayesian econometrics.  We hired him and he has done magical things with our software, making estimating hierarchical Bayesian models in “real time” on very large, complex datasets a reality.  He’s a super guy, to boot!  Together with others on our staff, we now have fully parallelized versions of most econometric models working on over 100 cores.  (You may have read a paper by one of my partners, Prof John Liechty at Penn State, on parallel slicer samplers).</p><p>5 0.82642436 <a title="183-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-24-Bayesian_quality_control%3F.html">1912 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-24-Bayesian quality control?</a></p>

I saw  this post and response  from about 5 years ago, regarding a fellow analyzing levels of white blood cells.


He was asking about Bayesian approaches to quality control and couldn’t find a canonical resource on that topic. Five years on and I similarly don’t see many good resources on the topic, though it seems like a useful application of Bayesian analysis. Just wondering if you have any further thoughts on the matter now after a few years.


In my searching, I did find  this interesting book  on Bayesian Reliability.  It’s not quality control, of course, but it does seem that failure prediction and risk analysis have some bearing on quality control and process control. And the cited reviews are very positive. It was written by some researchers at Los Alamos.


Also an edited  book  on process control:  I saw that Bill Bolstad gives it a positive review in one of the journals. And a  book  on Bayesian risk analysis.</p><p>6 0.82346565 <a title="183-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-28-Why_during_the_1950-1960%E2%80%B2s_did_Jerry_Cornfield_become_a_Bayesian%3F.html">2000 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-28-Why during the 1950-1960′s did Jerry Cornfield become a Bayesian?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A neuroeconomist asks::
  
Is there any literature on the Bayesian approach to simultaneous equation systems that you could suggest? (Think demand/supply in econ).
  
My reply:  Iâ&euro;&trade;m not up-to-date on the Bayesian econometrics literature.  TTony Lancaster came out with a book a few years ago that might have some of these models.  Maybe you, the commenters, have some suggestions?  Measurement-error models are inherently Bayesian, seeing as they have all these latent parameters, so it seems like there should be a lot out there.</p><p>3 0.91029024 <a title="183-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-27-%E2%80%9CDisappointed_with_your_results%3F__Boost_your_scientific_paper%E2%80%9D.html">2188 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-27-“Disappointed with your results?

<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression   
book (p. 317), using the U.S. Senate instead of the Supreme Court, and

<p>Introduction: Pablo Verde sends in  this letter  he and Daniel Curcio just published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. They had published a meta-analysis with a boundary estimate which, he said, gave nonsense results.  Here’s Curcio and Verde’s key paragraph:
  
The authors [of the study they are criticizing] performed a test of heterogeneity between studies. Given that the test result was not significant at 5%, they decided to pool all the RRs by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in meta-analysis, which usually leads to very misleading results. First of all, the pooled RR as well as its standard	error are sensitive to 2 the estimation of the between-studies standard deviation (SD).	SD is difficult to estimate with a small number of studies. On the other hand, it is very well known that the significant test of hetero- geneity lacks statistical power to detect values of SD greater than zero. In addition, the statistically non-significant re</p><p>6 0.9019587 <a title="183-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-12-Too_tired_to_mock.html">1800 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-12-Too tired to mock</a></p>

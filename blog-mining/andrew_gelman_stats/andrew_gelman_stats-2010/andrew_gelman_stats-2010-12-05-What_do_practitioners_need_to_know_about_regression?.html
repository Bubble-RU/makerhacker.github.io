<p>Introduction: A research psychologist writes in with a question that’s so long that I’ll put my answer first, then put the question itself below the fold.
 
Here’s my reply:
 
As I wrote in my Anova paper and in my book with Jennifer Hill, I do think that multilevel models can completely replace Anova.  At the same time, I think the central idea of Anova should persist in our understanding of these models.  To me the central idea of Anova is not F-tests or p-values or sums of squares, but rather the idea of predicting an outcome based on factors with discrete levels, and understanding these factors using variance components.
 
The continuous or categorical response thing doesn’t really matter so much to me.  I have no problem using a normal linear model for continuous outcomes (perhaps suitably transformed) and a logistic model for binary outcomes.
 
I don’t want to throw away interactions just because they’re not statistically significant.

Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

I have been slowly working my way through the grad program in stats here, and the latest course was a biostats course on categorical and survival analysis.  I noticed in the semi-parametric  and parametric material (Wang and Lee is the text) that they use stepwise regression a lot.


I learned in econometrics that stepwise is poor practice, as it defaults to the “theory of the regression line”, that is no theory at all, just the variation in the data.


I don’t find the topic on your blog, and wonder if you have addressed the issue.
  
My reply:
 
Stepwise regression is one of these things, like outlier detection and pie charts, which appear to be popular among non-statisticans but are considered by statisticians to be a bit of a joke.  For example, Jennifer and I don’t mention stepwise regression in our book, not even once.

After seeing it cited, I just read  your paper  in Technometrics.  The home radon levels provide an interesting and instructive example.


I [Hoaglin] have a different take on the difficulty of interpreting the estimated coefficient of the county-level basement proportion (gamma-sub-2) on page 434.  An important part of the difficulty involves “other things being equal.”  That sounds like the widespread interpretation of a regression coefficient as telling how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor when the other predictors are held constant.  Unfortunately, as a general interpretation, that language is oversimplified; it doesn’t reflect how regression actually works.

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas writes:
  
 
In much of the social sciences outside economics, it’s very common for people to take a regression course or two in graduate school and then stop their statistical education. This creates a situation where you have a large pool of people who have some knowledge, but not a lot of knowledge. As a result, you have a pretty big gap between people like yourself, who are heavily invested in the cutting edge of applied statistics, and other folks.


So here is the question: What are the major lessons about good statistical practice that “rank and file” social scientists should know? Sure, most people can recite “Correlation is not causation” or “statistical significance is not substantive significance.” But what are the other big lessons?


This question comes from my own experience. I have a math degree and took regression analysis in graduate school, but I definitely do not have the level of knowledge of a statistician. I also do mixed method research, and field wor</p><p>2 0.96069133 <a title="451-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-03-Google_Translate_for_code%2C_and_an_R_help-list_bot.html">1296 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-03-Google Translate for code, and an R help-list bot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What we did in our Stan meeting yesterday:
 
Some discussion of revision of the Nuts paper, some conversations about parameterizations of categorical-data models, plans for the R interface, blah blah blah.
 
But also, I had two exciting new ideas!
 
 Google Translate for code 
 
Wouldn’t it be great if Google Translate could work on computer languages?  I suggested this and somebody said that it might be a problem because code isn’t always translatable.  But that doesn’t worry so much.  Google Translate for human languages isn’t perfect either but it’s a useful guide.  If I want to write a message to someone in French or Spanish or Dutch, I wouldn’t just write it in English and run it through Translate.  What I do is try my best to write it in the desired language, but I can try out some tricky words or phrases in the translator.  Or, if I start by translating, I go back and forth to make sure it all makes sense.

<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Stephen Senn, “You May Believe You Are a Bayesian But You Are Probably Wrong”:
 
I agree with Senn’s comments on the impossibility of the de Finetti subjective Bayesian approach.  As I wrote in 2008, if you could really construct a subjective prior you believe in, why not just look at the data and write down your subjective posterior.  The immense practical difficulties with  any  serious system of inference render it absurd to think that it would be possible to just write down a probability distribution to represent uncertainty.  I wish, however, that Senn would recognize  my  Bayesian approach (which is also that of John Carlin, Hal Stern, Don Rubin, and, I believe, others).  De Finetti is no longer around, but we are!
 
I have to admit that my own Bayesian views and practices have changed.  In particular, I resonate wit</p><p>4 0.95675534 <a title="451-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-30-Silly_baseball_example_illustrates_a_couple_of_key_ideas_they_don%E2%80%99t_usually_teach_you_in_statistics_class.html">171 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-30-Silly baseball example illustrates a couple of key ideas they don’t usually teach you in statistics class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From a commenter on the web, 21 May 2010:
  
Tampa Bay:  Playing .732 ball in the toughest division in baseball, wiped their feet on NY twice.  If they sweep Houston, which seems pretty likely, they will be at .750, which I [the commenter] have never heard of. 
  
At the time of that posting, the Rays were 30-11.  Quick calculation:  if a team is good enough to be expected to win 100 games, that is, Pr(win) = 100/162 = .617, then there’s a 5% chance that they’ll have won at least 30 of their first 41 games.  That’s a calculation based on simple probability theory of independent events, which isn’t quite right here but will get you close and is a good way to  train one’s intuition , I think.
 
Having a .732 record after 41 games is not unheard-of.  The Detroit Tigers won 35 of their first 40 games in 1984:  that’s .875.  (I happen to remember that fast start, having been an Orioles fan at the time.) 
 
 Now on to the key ideas

<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

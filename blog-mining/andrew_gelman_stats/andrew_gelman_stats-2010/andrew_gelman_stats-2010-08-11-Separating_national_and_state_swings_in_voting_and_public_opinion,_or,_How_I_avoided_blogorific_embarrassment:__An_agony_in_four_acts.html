 Nebraska Is All That Counts for a Party-Bucking Nelson 


Dem Senator On Blowback From His Opposition To Kagan: ‘Are They From Nebraska? Then I Don’t Care’


Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…

[sent-2, score-0.325]
</p><p>2 Applying multilevel regression and poststratification  (“Mister P”) to recent ABC poll data, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and John Kastellec estimate that 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 61% of Independents, and 39% of Republicans in the state. [sent-14, score-0.574]
</p><p>3 A national poll of 1500 Americans will include about 10 people from Nebraska, so these estimates of 91%, 61%, 39% can’t be coming directly from the data. [sent-16, score-0.48]
</p><p>4 Brian Beutler also reports that “Last month,  a Republican poll  found Kagan had only 33 percent support in Nebraska, with 48 opposed to her confirmation. [sent-41, score-0.33]
</p><p>5 According to the link, the poll found Kagan’s nomination having only 41% support in Wisconsin (with 43% opposed) and with 28% support in Arkansas (with 54% opposed). [sent-43, score-0.386]
</p><p>6 That’s certainly  possible –as noted above, the ABC poll that my colleagues analyzed has small sample sizes in any given state–but it’s not so  plausible  to me that these three states would differ so much from the model’s prediction based on national data. [sent-44, score-0.45]
</p><p>7 Jeff clarified for me:    Sure, the ABC poll is out of whack with the newer Gallup poll, but for the ABC poll data there is no reason to think the estimates are off. [sent-65, score-0.485]
</p><p>8 If we have to scrap this point, it’s bc the polls disagree, not bc of MRP doing anything wrong. [sent-66, score-0.317]
</p><p>9 But there’s a deeper lesson too, a lesson about how to understand and interpret state-level polls and election results. [sent-76, score-0.417]
</p><p>10 Opinion swings can be decomposed into components:  national swing, regional swings (relative to U. [sent-77, score-0.535]
</p><p>11 ), state swings (relative to regions), democraphic swings (relative to the whole), etc. [sent-79, score-0.422]
</p><p>12 A decomposition allows you to estimate national swing more precisely. [sent-82, score-0.393]
</p><p>13 (Not that there’s anything wrong with the ABC polls; to estimate national opinion we’d use ABC, Gallup, and everything else we can get our hands on. [sent-86, score-0.542]
</p><p>14 We can use national polls for national opinion and use Mister P to estimate relative opinion. [sent-88, score-0.935]
</p><p>15 )   The message for Mister P is that estimates should be adjusted using available national information. [sent-89, score-0.272]
</p><p>16 We did this in our  election maps  (adjusting to state-by-state vote) and also in our  health care maps  (by plotting opinion relative to 50%), and it’s in my (not quite finished) paper with Yair and in the mrp package, I think. [sent-90, score-0.437]
</p><p>17 Reprise    When forecasting or interpreting state-level votes or opinion swings, decompose into two parts:  national swing, and state swings relative to each other. [sent-92, score-0.791]
</p><p>18 And if you want to estimate Nebraska itself, estimate national opinion as accurately as possible–that’s not difficult to do, it’s easy to get summaries from national polls–and then shift over to estimate Nebraska. [sent-94, score-0.957]
</p><p>19 (So if your best estimate of the national level of support were 55%, say, then you’d subtract 7 points and get an estimate of 48% for Nebraska, given all the information available to you. [sent-95, score-0.516]
</p><p>20 In  our paper , Kari and I discuss how to apply this approach to forecasting presidential elections by state, but the idea is really more general than that, and is something we should all be aware of when reporting state polls or state-level estimates from national polls.

<p>Introduction: On the basis of two papers and because it is completely obvious, we (meaning  me , Justin, and  John ) predict that Elena Kagan will get confirmed to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  But we also want to see how close we can come to predicting the votes for and against.
 
We actually have two sets of predictions, both using the MRP technique discussed previously on this blog.  The first is based on our  recent paper  in the  Journal of Politics  showing that support for the nominee in a senator’s home state plays a striking role in whether she or he votes to confirm the nominee.  The second is based on a  new working paper  extending “basic” MRP to show that senators respond far more to their co-partisans than the median voter in their home states.  Usually, our vote “predictions” do not differ much, but there is a group of senators who are predicted to vote yes for Kagan with a probability around 50% and the two sets of predictions thus differ for Kagan more than usual.</p><p>3 0.20344214 <a title="200-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-Poll_aggregation_and_election_forecasting.html">1570 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-Poll aggregation and election forecasting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, Henry  writes  about poll averaging and election forecasts.  Henry writes that “These models need to crunch lots of polls, at the state and national level, if they’re going to provide good predictions.” Actually, you can get reasonable predictions from national-level forecasting models plus previous state-level election results, then when the election comes closer you can use national and state polls as needed. See my paper with Kari Lock,  Bayesian combination of state polls and election forecasts .  (That said, the method in that paper is fairly complicated, much more so than simply taking weighted averages of state polls, if such abundant data happen to be available.  And I’m sure our approach would need to be altered if it were used for real-time forecasts.)
 
Having a steady supply of polls of varying quality from various sources allows poll aggregators to produce  news  every day (in the sense of pushing their estimates around) but it doesn’t help much with a</p><p>4 0.18169942 <a title="200-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-Comparison_of_forecasts_for_the_2010_congressional_elections.html">270 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-Comparison of forecasts for the 2010 congressional elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>5 0.1665203 <a title="200-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-17-Death%21.html">962 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-17-Death!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This graph shows the estimate that Kenny Shirley and I have of support for the death penalty by sex and race in the U.S. since 1955:
 
   
 
We also found that capital punishment used to be more popular in the Northeast than in the South, but now it’s the other way around.
 
Here’s the abstract to  our paper :
  
One of the longest running questions that has been regularly included in Gallup’s national public opinion poll is “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Because the death penalty is governed by state laws rather than federal laws, it is of special interest to know how public opinion varies by state, and how it has changed over time within each state. In this paper we combine dozens of national polls taken over a fifty-year span and fit a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to individual response data to estimate changes in state-level public opinion over time. Such a long span of polls has not been analyzed this way before, partly</p><p>6 0.159657 <a title="200-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The above graph shows the estimated support, by state, for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a gay rights bill that the Senate will be voting on this Monday.  The estimates were constructed by Kate Krimmel, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips using multilevel regression and poststratification.
 
Check out that graph again.  The scale goes from 20% to 80%, but  every state  is in the yellow-to-red range.  Support for a law making it illegal to discriminate against gays has majority support in every state. And in most states the support is very strong.
 
And  here’s the research paper  by Krimmel, Lax, and Phillips, which begins:
  
Public majorities have supported several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress has responded slowly if at all. We address this puzzle through dyadic analysis of the opinion- vote relationship on 23 roll-call votes between 1993 and 2010, matching members of Congress to policy-specific opinion in their state or district.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  wrote  that Mickey Kaus was right to point out that it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.” As Kaus points out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.  The slogan is particularly silly for Tip O’Neill himself.  Sure, O’Neill had to have a firm grip on local politics to get his safe seat in the first place, but after that it was smooth sailing.
 
Jonathan Bernstein  disagrees , writing:
  
 
Yes, but: don’t most Members of the House have ironclad partisan districts?  And isn’t the most important single thing they can do to protect themselves involve having pull in state politics to avoid being gerrymandered?  That is “all politics is local,” no? 


There’s also a fair amount they can do to stay on the good side of their local party, thus avoiding a primary fight.  And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>5 0.73734361 <a title="200-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-Poll_aggregation_and_election_forecasting.html">1570 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-Poll aggregation and election forecasting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, Henry  writes  about poll averaging and election forecasts.  Henry writes that “These models need to crunch lots of polls, at the state and national level, if they’re going to provide good predictions.” Actually, you can get reasonable predictions from national-level forecasting models plus previous state-level election results, then when the election comes closer you can use national and state polls as needed. See my paper with Kari Lock,  Bayesian combination of state polls and election forecasts .  (That said, the method in that paper is fairly complicated, much more so than simply taking weighted averages of state polls, if such abundant data happen to be available.  And I’m sure our approach would need to be altered if it were used for real-time forecasts.)
 
Having a steady supply of polls of varying quality from various sources allows poll aggregators to produce  news  every day (in the sense of pushing their estimates around) but it doesn’t help much with a</p><p>6 0.71504718 <a title="200-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-17-Distorting_the_Electoral_Connection%3F_Partisan_Representation_in_Confirmation_Politics.html">152 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-17-Distorting the Electoral Connection?

<p>Introduction: Jim Thomson writes:
  
I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>2 0.94099301 <a title="200-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-05-Related_to_z-statistics.html">1301 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-05-Related to z-statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko points me to a  news article  by Zack Beauchamp on Jason Richwine, the recent Ph.D. graduate from Harvard’s policy school who left the conservative Heritage Foundation after it came out that his Ph.D. thesis was said to be all  about  the low IQ’s of Hispanic immigrants.  Heritage and  others  apparently thought this association could discredit their anti-immigration-reform position.  Richwine’s mentor Charles Murray was  unhappy  about the whole episode.
 
Beauchamp’s article is worth reading in that it provides some interesting background, in particular by getting into the details of the Ph.D. review process.  In a sense, Beauchamp is too harsh.  Flawed Ph.D. theses get published all the time.  I’d say that  most  Ph.D. theses I’ve seen are flawed:  usually the plan is to get the papers into shape later, when submitting them to journals.  If a student doesn’t go into academia, the thesis typically just sits there and is rarely followed up on.

It started when Jeff Lax made  this comment  on his recent blog entry:

Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…
  
I conferred with Jeff and then wrote the following entry for fivethirtyeight.com.  There was a backlog of posts at 538 at the time, so I set it on delay to appear the following morning.

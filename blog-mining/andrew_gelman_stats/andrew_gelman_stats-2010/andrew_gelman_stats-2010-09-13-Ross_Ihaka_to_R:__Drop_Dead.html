The x being returned by this function is randomly local or global. There are other examples where variables alternate between local and non-local throughout the body of a function. No sensible language would allow this.  It’s ugly and it makes optimisation really difficult.

<p>Introduction: Andrew and I have been discussing how we’re going to define functions in Stan for defining systems of differential equations;  see our evolving  ode design doc ;  comments welcome, of course.
 
 About Scope 
 
I mentioned to Andrew I would prefer pure lexical, static scoping, as found in languages like C++ and Java.  If you’re not familiar with the alternatives, there’s a nice overview in the  Wikipedia article on scope .  Let me call out a few passages that will help set the context.
  

A fundamental distinction in scoping is what “context” means – whether name resolution depends on the location in the source code (lexical scope, static scope, which depends on the lexical context) or depends on the program state when the name is encountered (dynamic scope, which depends on the execution context or calling context). Lexical resolution can be determined at compile time, and is also known as early binding, while dynamic resolution can in general only be determined at run time, and thus</p><p>3 0.12657066 <a title="272-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-14-Wickham_R_short_course.html">1009 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-14-Wickham R short course</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadley  writes:
  
I [Hadley] am going to be teaching an R development master class in New York City on Dec 
12-13. The basic idea of the class is to help you write better code, 
focused on the mantra of “do not repeat yourself”. In day one you will 
learn powerful new tools of abstraction, allowing you to solve a wider 
range of problems with fewer lines of code. Day two will teach you how 
to make packages, the fundamental unit of code distribution in R, 
allowing others to save time by allowing them to use your code.


To get the most out of this course, you should have some experience 
programming in R already: you should be familiar with writing 
functions, and the basic data structures of R: vectors, matrices, 
arrays, lists and data frames. You will find the course particularly 
useful if you’re an experienced R user looking to take the next step, 
or if you’re moving to R from other programming languages and you want 
to quickly get up to speed with R’s unique features.

<p>Introduction: We just released Stan 1.1.1 and RStan 1.1.1
 
As usual, you can find download and install instructions at:
 
http://mc-stan.org/
 
This is a patch release and is fully backward compatible with Stan and RStan 1.1.0.  The main thing you should notice is that the multivariate models should be much faster and all the bugs reported for 1.1.0 have been fixed.  We’ve also added a bit more functionality.  The substantial changes are listed in the following release notes. 
   
v1.1.1 (5 February 2012) 
======================================================================
 
Bug Fixes 
———————————- 
* fixed bug in comparison operators, which swapped operator< with operator<= and swapped operator> with operator>= semantics 
* auto-initialize all variables to prevent segfaults 
* atan2 gradient propagation fixed 
* fixed off-by-one in NUTS treedepth bound so NUTS goes at most to specified tree depth rather than specified depth + 1 
* various compiler compatibility and minor consistency issues

<p>Introduction: Some thoughts from Christian , including this bit:
  
We need to consider separately


1. R’s brilliant library


2. R’s not-so-brilliant language and/or interpreter.
  
I don’t know that R’s library is so brilliant as all that–if necessary, I don’t think it would be hard to reprogram the important packages in a new language.
 
I would say, though, that the problems with R are not just in the technical details of the language.  I think the culture of R has some problems too.  As I’ve written before, R functions used to be lean and mean, and now they’re full of exception-handling and calls to other packages.  R functions are spaghetti-like messes of connections in which I keep expecting to run into syntax like “GOTO 120.”
 
I learned about these problems a couple years ago when writing bayesglm(), which is a simple adaptation of glm().  But glm(), and its workhorse, glm.fit(), are a mess:  They’re about 10 lines of functioning code, plus about 20 lines of necessary front-end, plus a cou</p><p>3 0.8727898 <a title="272-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-04-Shlemiel_the_Software_Developer_and_Unknown_Unknowns.html">2089 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-04-Shlemiel the Software Developer and Unknown Unknowns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Stan meeting today reminded me of Joel Spolsky’s recasting of the Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the Painter. Joel retold it on his blog,  Joel on Software , in the post  Back to Basics :
  

Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”


“I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”

I didn’t go and check whether it does things 111,222,333 or 123,123,123, but in any event the “parallel chains” in JAGS are samples drawn from distinct RNGs computed on a single processor core.
  But we all have multiple cores now, or we’re computing on a cluster or the cloud! So the behavior we’d like from  rjags  is to use the  foreach  package with each JAGS chain using a parallel-safe RNG. The default behavior with  n.chain=1  will be that each parallel instance will use  .RNG.name[1] , the Wichmann-Hill RNG. 
  JAGS 2.2.0 includes a new  lecuyer  module (along with the  glm  module, which everyone should probably always use, and doesn’t have many undocumented tricks that I know of).  But lecuyer is completely undocumented!  I tried  .RNG.name="lecuyer::Lecuyer" ,  .RNG.name="lecuyer::lecuyer" , and  .RNG.name=</p><p>6 0.85052413 <a title="272-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-02-RStudio_%E2%80%93_new_cross-platform_IDE_for_R.html">597 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-02-RStudio – new cross-platform IDE for R</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.

<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>3 0.95959842 <a title="272-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-04-%E2%80%9CTurn_a_Boring_Bar_Graph_into_a_3D_Masterpiece%E2%80%9D.html">1154 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-04-“Turn a Boring Bar Graph into a 3D Masterpiece”</a></p>

Steps include “Make whimsical sparkles by drawing an ellipse using the Ellipse Tool,” “Rotate the sparkles . . . Give some sparkles less Opacity by using the Transparency Palette,” and “Add a haze around each sparkle by drawing a white ellipse using the Ellipse Tool.”
 
The punchline:
  
Now, the next time you need to include a boring graph in one of your designs you’ll be able to add some extra emphasis and get people to really pay attention to those numbers!

<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>5 0.93855119 <a title="272-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Gregor_Mendel%E2%80%99s_suspicious_data.html">1449 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Gregor Mendel’s suspicious data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points me to a  thoughtful discussion  by Moti Nissani on “Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox.”
 
The paradox, as Nissani defines it, is that Mendel’s data seem in many cases too good to be true, yet Mendel had a reputation for probity and it seems doubtful that he had a Mark-Hauser-style attitude toward reporting scientific data.  Nissani writes:
  
Taken together, the situation seems paradoxical. On the one hand, we have evidence that “the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel’s expectations.” We also have good reasons to believe that Mendel encountered linkage but failed to report it and that he may have taken the somewhat unusual step of having his scientific records destroyed shortly after his death. On the other hand, everything else we know about him/in addition to his undisputed genius/suggests a man of unimpeachable integrity, fine observational powers, and a pa</p><p>6 0.93801385 <a title="272-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-19-%E2%80%9CThe_best_living_writer_of_thrillers%E2%80%9D.html">581 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-19-“The best living writer of thrillers”</a></p>

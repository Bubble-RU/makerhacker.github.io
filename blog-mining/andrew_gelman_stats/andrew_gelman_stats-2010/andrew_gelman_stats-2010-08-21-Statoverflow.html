Dear Colleague,


Recently we informed you about SciRev, our new website where researchers can share their experiences with the peer review process and select an efficient journal for submitting their work. 


Since our start, we already received over 500 reviews and many positive reactions, which reveal a great need for comparable information on duration and quality of the review process. All reviews are publicly available on our website, both at the pages of the journals and in an overview at www.scirev.sc/reviews


To make this venture a success, many reviews are needed. We therefore would appreciate it very much if you could take a few minutes to visit our website www.SciRev.sc and share your recent review experiences with your colleagues.


SciRev also offers you the possibility to create a free account where you can administer your manuscripts under review and create a personal journal list.


Thanks on behalf of the research community,

<p>Introduction: Amanda Martinez, a writer for The Atlantic and others, advised attendees that her favorite writing “accorded me the basic human dignity of allowing me to draw my own conclusions.”
  
I really like that way of putting it, and this is something we tried hard to do with Red State Blue State, to put the information and our reasoning right there in front of the reader, rather than hiding behind a bunch of statistically-significant regression coefficients.
 
This is related to the idea of presenting research findings quantitatively (which, I think, lends itself to clearer statements of uncertainty and variation) rather than qualitatively (which seems to come out more deterministically, as “X causes Y” or “when A happens, B happens”).
 
The above quote comes from a conference of students organized by Nathan Sanders, who writes:

<p>Introduction: Seth Rogers writes:
  
I [Rogers] am a member of an online community of statisticians where I burn a great deal of time (and a recovering cog sci researcher). Our community website is a peer-reviewed Q and A spanning stats topics ranging from applications to mathematical theory. Our online community consists of mostly university faculty, grad students and technical consultants. The answer quality is very strong and the web design is intuitive. I think you and your readers are like-minded and would be really interested in some of the topics on the site,  CrossValidated  (you may know the sister site:  stackoverflow.com ). The philosophy is purely to further knowledge for the sake of knowledge and take pride in learning.
  
I took a quick look and the site seemed like it could be useful to people.  The only thing I didn’t understand is, why doesn’t it have a search function?  (Or maybe it was there somewhere and I couldn’t find it.)

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email: 
  
  
Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.


We’re looking for new talent to help with our fast-growing portfolio in these areas:

I [Bueker] am analyzing the effect of various contextual factors on the voter turnout of naturalized Latino citizens.  I have included the natural log of the number of Spanish Language ads run in each state during the election cycle to predict voter turnout.  I now want to calculate the predicted probabilities of turnout for those in states with 0 ads, 500 ads, 1000 ads, etc.  The problem is that I do not know how to handle the beta coefficient of the LN(Spanish language ads).  Is there someway to “unlog” the coefficient?
  
My reply:  Calculate these probabilities for specific values of predictors, then graph the predictions of interest.  Also, you can average over the other inputs in your model to get summaries.  See  this article  with Pardoe for further discussion.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88651466 <a title="223-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Statoverflow.html">223 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Statoverflow</a></p>

I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>6 0.85580873 <a title="223-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Our_data_visualization_panel_at_the_New_York_Public_Library.html">1256 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Our data visualization panel at the New York Public Library</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Despite the title, this post is mostly not about economics or even politics but rather about the central role of  comparisons  in statistics and statistical graphics.
 
It started when someone pointed me to  this article  in which Megan McArdle points out the misleadingness of a graph that seems to show a bimodal income distribution but only by combining cells in the tail:
 
 
 
McArdle makes a good point:  of course, if you spread the histogram along a uniform scale (or, for that matter, a log scale), you don’t see that bump at the high end.  McArdle reproduces some Census charts showing income stability over the past few decades:

<p>Introduction: Pointing to this  news article  by Megan McArdle discussing a recent study of Medicaid recipients, Jonathan Falk writes:
  
Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.
 

and

 
A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.  At the time, I conjectured this was a general difference in attitude between political scientists and economists, but in retrospect I realize I’m dealing with n=1 in each case.
 
 See here  for further discussion of taxing “justly acquired endowments.”
 
The only reason I’m bringing this all up now is that I think it is relevant to our recent discussion  here  and  here  of Mankiw’s work incentives.  Mankiw objected to paying a higher marginal tax rate, and I think part of this is that he sees taxes as a form of punishment, and since he came by his income honestly he doesn’t think it’s fair to have to pay taxes on it.   My perspective i</p><p>5 0.12443043 <a title="311-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Mankiw%E2%80%99s_marginal_tax_rate_%28which_declined_from_93%25_to_80%25_in_two_years%29_and_the_difficulty_of_microeconomic_reasoning.html">336 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Mankiw’s marginal tax rate (which declined from 93% to 80% in two years) and the difficulty of microeconomic reasoning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Greg Mankiw  writes  (link from  Tyler Cowen ):
  
Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000. I would have twice the incentive to keep working.
  
 First, the good news 
 
Obama’s tax rates are much lower than Mankiw had anticipated!  According to the above quote, his marginal tax rate is currently 80% but threatens to rise to 90%.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  links  to a  blog  by Megan McArdle which reproduces a list entitled, “What You Paid For:  2009 tax receipt for a taxpayer earning $34,140 and paying $5,400 in federal income tax and FICA (selected items).”

<p>Introduction: My sometime coauthor Aaron Edlin cowrote (with Ian Ayres)  an op-ed  recommending a clever approach to taxing the rich.
 
In their article they employ a charming bit of economics jargon, using the word “earn” to mean “how much money you make.”  They “propose an automatic extra tax on the income of the top 1 percent of earners.”  I assume their tax would apply to unearned income as well, but they (or their editor at the Times) are just so used to describing income as “earnings” that they just threw that in.  Funny.
 
Also, there’s a part of the article that doesn’t make sense to me. 
   
Ayres and Edlin first describe the level of inequality:
  
In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.
  
Then they lay out their solution:
  
Enough is enough. . . . we propose an automatic extra tax on the income</p><p>3 0.82328665 <a title="311-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>4 0.81500715 <a title="311-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw_tax_update.html">366 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw tax update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.

Peter A. Diamond, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also received the Nobel in economic science in 2010, observed that over the long run, cutting the cash award could dilute the prize’s prestige.


But he added that Monday’s news overstates the financial blow to future laureates. “One of the things that comes with the prize, besides the prestige and the money,” he said, “is the opportunities to make more money.”
  
I wouldn’t think these guys need the money, but I suppose it’s part of their professional code that they have to say that?  (Recall our earlier  discussion  of the economist who said he’d stop working once his marginal tax rate reached the anticipated value of 93%.)</p><p>6 0.80339932 <a title="311-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-23-Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_utility_function.html">2261 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-23-Greg Mankiw’s utility function</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93043309 <a title="311-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-02-Where_do_our_taxes_go%3F.html">311 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-02-Where do our taxes go?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  links  to a  blog  by Megan McArdle which reproduces a list entitled, “What You Paid For:  2009 tax receipt for a taxpayer earning $34,140 and paying $5,400 in federal income tax and FICA (selected items).”
 
McArdle writes, “isn’t it possible that the widespread support for programs like Social Security and Medicare rests on the fact that most people don’t realize just how big a portion of your paycheck those programs consume?”  But, as Palko points out, the FICA and Medicare withholdings are actually already right there on your W-2 form.  So the real problem is not a lack of information but that people aren’t reading their W-2 forms more carefully.  (Also, I don’t know if people are so upset about their withholdings for Social Security and Medicare, given that they’ll be getting that money back when they retire.)
 
I’m more concerned about the list itself, though.  I think a lot of cognitive-perceptual effects are involved in what gets a separate line item, and what doesn</p><p>3 0.91875392 <a title="311-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-27-Richard_Stallman_and_John_McCarthy.html">1031 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-27-Richard Stallman and John McCarthy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After blogging on quirky software pioneer  Richard Stallman , I thought it appropriate to write something about recently deceased quirky software pioneer John McCarthy, who, with the exception of being bearded, seems like he was the personal and political opposite of Stallman.
 
 Here’s  a page I found of  Stallman  McCarthy quotes (compiled by Neil Craig).  It’s a mixture of the reasonable and the unreasonable (ok, I suppose the same could be said of this blog!).
 
I wonder if he and Stallman ever met and, if so, whether they had an extended conversation.  It would be like matter and anti-matter! 
   
P.S.  I flipped through McCarthy’s pages and found one of my pet peeves.  See item 3  here , which sounds so plausible but is in fact  not true  (at least, not according to the National Election Study).  As McCarthy’s Stanford colleague Mo Fiorina can tell you, otherwise well-informed people believe all sorts of things about polarization that aren’t so.

<p>Introduction: Jeffrey Frankel, identified as a former member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers,  writes  (link from  here ):
  
As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. . . .


The unspoken truth is that, compared to “blue-staters,” those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies.
  
An unspoken truth, huh?  Wow, that really sucks!  Something should be done about it.  Good thing that this Harvard professor and former member of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors is on the case:

<p>Introduction: This post was written by Phil.
 
A medical company is testing a cancer drug. They get a 16 genetically identical (or nearly identical) rats that all have the same kind of tumor, give 8 of them the drug and leave 8 untreated…or maybe they give them a placebo, I don’t know; is there a placebo effect in rats?.  Anyway, after a while the rats are killed and examined. If the tumors in the treated rats are smaller than the tumors in the untreated rats, then all of the rats have their blood tested for dozens of different proteins that are known to be associated with tumor growth or suppression.  If there is a “significant” difference in one of the protein levels, then the working assumption is that the drug increases or decreases levels of that protein and that may be the mechanism by which the drug affects cancer. All of the above is done on many different cancer types and possibly several different types of rats.  It’s just the initial screening: if things look promising, many more tests an</p><p>6 0.90396106 <a title="311-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-16-Blog_bribes%21.html">1012 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-16-Blog bribes!</a></p>

Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar.

[sent-25, score-0.896]
</p><p>2 A Democratic senator such as Chuck Schumer of New York gets the votes of the rich and the poor in roughly equal proportions. [sent-26, score-0.571]
</p><p>3 In each case, the Republicans win the poor states and the Democrats win the rich states, but the scenarios differ in the pattern of income and voting  within  states. [sent-33, score-1.404]
</p><p>4 - In  Statesworld , voting varies by state income but not at all by individual income within state. [sent-34, score-0.687]
</p><p>5 In this world, states that vote more Republican do so uniformly at all income levels. [sent-35, score-0.581]
</p><p>6 This is the scenario that people may assume after seeing the red-state, blue-state map:  a world in which the Democrats win the rich vote, and the Republicans the poor vote, in every state. [sent-37, score-0.72]
</p><p>7 - In Votesworld, rich people tend to vote Republican, with income predicting vote choice in the same way across all states. [sent-38, score-0.754]
</p><p>8 This is how we had imagined the nation to be, after checking out the patterns of income and voting at the state and national level, but before analyzing income patterns within states. [sent-39, score-0.9]
</p><p>9 - Finally, in the  Real World , richer people vote Republican in every state, but the relation between income and vote choice is much stronger in poor states than in rich states. [sent-40, score-1.307]
</p><p>10 In Statesworld, we would expect politicians to have strong geographic loyalties:  Republican officeholders would fight for Mississippians of all income groups and Democrats would lobby for the richer states. [sent-42, score-0.616]
</p><p>11 For example, Republicans might favor higher federal transfers to the poor (who are more likely to live in low-income states), and Democrats might favor reducing the top rate of income tax (which disproportionally hits the residents of rich states). [sent-44, score-1.068]
</p><p>12 In Reverseworld, the connection between party and income is even clearer, with Republicans dominating among low-income voters in Mississippi and other poor states, and Democrats relying on richer voters in rich states. [sent-45, score-1.339]
</p><p>13 In this world, it would make sense for the yuppie Democrats to strongly resist the graduated income tax (which takes money from high-income people in rich states) and for the middle-American Republicans to support higher taxes and income transfers. [sent-46, score-1.031]
</p><p>14 Continuing with our hypotheticals,  neither the Statesworld or Reverseworld stories are plausible; it is the Democrats who favor higher transfers to the poor and Republicans who prefer lower tax rates. [sent-52, score-0.472]
</p><p>15 This makes sense in Votesworld, a scenario in which the Democrats consistently get the votes of poorer voters and Republicans win richer voters throughout the country. [sent-53, score-0.732]
</p><p>16 In Votesworld, the Republicans rely on rich votes in Mississippi and the Democrats, symmetrically, dominate among the poor in Connecticut. [sent-54, score-0.622]
</p><p>17 Votesworld is not far from the truth, but, in the Real World, there is a much steeper income–voting divide in poor states than in rich states. [sent-55, score-0.705]
</p><p>18 On the other hand, in richer states such as Connecticut, the Democrats are the leading party, but with the support of all income groups. [sent-58, score-0.689]
</p><p>19 Add this up at the national level and there is a net benefit for the rich and middle class:  they are represented in the winning coalitions in both rich and poor states, whereas lower-income voters are only supporting the winning party in the rich states. [sent-60, score-1.427]
</p><p>20 This oversimplifies—a graph of all fifty states looks much messier than the picture of Mississippi, Ohio, and Connecticut—but it captures an essential asymmetry between the patterns of support for the Democrats and the  Republicans. [sent-61, score-0.455]

<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.   But that is always the case.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.28912109 <a title="79-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-14-Richer_people_continue_to_vote_Republican.html">1577 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-14-Richer people continue to vote Republican</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the exit polls:
 
 
 
This is all pretty obvious but it seemed worth posting because some people still don’t seem to get it.  For example, Jay Cost,  writing  in the Weekly Standard:
  
The Democratic party now dominates the Upper East Side of Manhattan, as well as the wealthiest neighborhoods in the most powerful cities. And yet Republicans are still effectively castigated as the party of the rich. They are not — at least not any more than the Democratic party is.
  
Arguably,  both  the Democrats and the Republicans are “the party of the rich.”  But Republicans more so than Democrats (see above graph, also consider the debates over the estate tax and upper-income tax rates).  Cost writes:
  
Sure, the GOP favors tax rate reductions to generate economic growth, but the Democratic party has proven itself ready, willing, and able to dole out benefits to the well-heeled rent-seekers who swarm Washington, D.C. looking for favors from Uncle Sam.
  
But he’s missing the point.

<p>Introduction: Charles Murray wrote a much-discussed new book, “Coming Apart:  The State of White America, 1960-2010.”
 
David Frum  quotes  Murray as writing, in an echo of now-forgotten TV personality  Tucker Carlson , that the top 5% of incomes “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it.  Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”
 
[I’ve interjected a “perhaps” into the title of this blog post to indicate that I don’t have the exact Murray quote here so I’m relying on David Frum’s interpretation.]
 
Frum does me the favor of citing Red State Blue State as evidence, and I’d like to back this up with some graphs.
 
Frum writes:
  
Say “top 5%” to Murray, and his imagination conjures up everything he dislikes: coastal liberals listening to NPR in their Lexus hybrid SUVs. He sees that image so intensely that no mere number can force him to remember that the top 5% also includes the evangelical Christian assistant coach of a state university football team. . . .

<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states. In light of this correlation, would you say that there currently is</p><p>3 0.88041735 <a title="79-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-27-Why_aren%E2%80%99t_Asians_Republicans%3F__For_one_thing%2C_more_than_half_of_them_live_in_California%2C_New_York%2C_New_Jersey%2C_and_Hawaii.html">1593 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-27-Why aren’t Asians Republicans?

Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: From the exit polls:
 
 
 
This is all pretty obvious but it seemed worth posting because some people still don’t seem to get it.  For example, Jay Cost,  writing  in the Weekly Standard:
  
The Democratic party now dominates the Upper East Side of Manhattan, as well as the wealthiest neighborhoods in the most powerful cities. And yet Republicans are still effectively castigated as the party of the rich. They are not — at least not any more than the Democratic party is.
  
Arguably,  both  the Democrats and the Republicans are “the party of the rich.”  But Republicans more so than Democrats (see above graph, also consider the debates over the estate tax and upper-income tax rates).  Cost writes:
  
Sure, the GOP favors tax rate reductions to generate economic growth, but the Democratic party has proven itself ready, willing, and able to dole out benefits to the well-heeled rent-seekers who swarm Washington, D.C. looking for favors from Uncle Sam.
  
But he’s missing the point.  The par</p><p>5 0.83195788 <a title="79-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Are_all_rich_people_now_liberals%3F.html">201 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Are all rich people now liberals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So  asks  James Ledbetter in Slate.
 
And  the answer is  . . . No!

P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>2 0.95492303 <a title="79-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>3 0.94729233 <a title="79-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>5 0.93991733 <a title="79-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-12-The_Naval_Research_Lab.html">1261 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-12-The Naval Research Lab</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.  The input is the heat from solar radiation (easy enough to compute given the trajectory).

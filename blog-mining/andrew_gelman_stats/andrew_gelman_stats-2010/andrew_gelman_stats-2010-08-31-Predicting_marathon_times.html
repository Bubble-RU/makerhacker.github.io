<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>4 0.13299723 <a title="245-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-13-Update_on_marathon_statistics.html">273 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-13-Update on marathon statistics</a></p>

 Here is a link  to the new stuff.  The update is a little less than half way down the page.


1. used display() instead of summary()


2. include a proxy for [non] newbies — whether I can find their name in a previous Chicago Marathon.


3. graph actual pace vs. fitted pace (color code newbie proxy)


4. estimate the model separately for newbies and non-newbies.


some incidental discussion of sd of errors.

<p>Introduction: Jake Hofman writes that he saw my recent newspaper  article  on running (“How fast do we slow down? . . . For each doubling of distance, the world record time is multiplied by about 2.15. . . . for sprints of 200 meters to 1,000 meters, a doubling of distance corresponds to an increase of a factor of 2.3 in world record running times; for longer distances from 1,000 meters to the marathon, a doubling of distance increases the time by a factor of 2.1. . . . similar patterns for men and women, and for swimming as well as running”) and writes:

In the comments to  an earlier post , I mentioned a problem I am struggling with right now. Several people mentioned having (and solving!) similar problems in the past, so this seems like a great way for me and a bunch of other blog readers to learn something. I will describe the problem, one or more of you will tell me how to solve it, and you will win…wait for it….my thanks, and the approval and admiration of your fellow blog readers, and a big thank-you in any publication that includes results from fitting the model.  You can’t ask fairer than that!
 
Here’s the problem.  The goal is to estimate six parameters that characterize the leakiness (or air-tightness) of a house with an attached garage.  We are specifically interested in the parameters that describe the connection between the house and the garage; this is of interest because of the effect on the air quality in the house  if there are toxic chemic</p><p>3 0.72992086 <a title="245-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-08-GiveWell_sez%3A__Cost-effectiveness_of_de-worming_was_overstated_by_a_factor_of_100_%28%21%29_due_to_a_series_of_sloppy_calculations.html">947 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-08-GiveWell sez:  Cost-effectiveness of de-worming was overstated by a factor of 100 (!) due to a series of sloppy calculations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexander at GiveWell  writes :
  
The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>4 0.70474231 <a title="245-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-08-Regression_and_causality_and_variable_ordering.html">2364 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-08-Regression and causality and variable ordering</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris wrote in with a question:
  
David Hogg points out in one of his general articles on data modeling that regression assumptions require one to put the variable with the highest variance in the ‘y’ position and the variable you know best (lowest variance) in the ‘x’ position.  As he points out, others speak of independent and dependent variables, as if causality determined the form of a regression formula.  In a quick scan of ARM and BDA, I don’t see clear advice, but I do see the use of ‘independent’ and ‘dependent.’


I recently did a model over data in which we know the ‘effect’ pretty well (we measure it), while we know the ’cause’ less well (it’s estimated by people who only need to get it approximately correct).  A model of the form ’cause ~ effect’ fit visually much better than one of the form ‘effect ~ cause’, but interpreting it seems challenging.  


For a simplistic example, let the effect be energy use in a building for cooling (E), and let the cause be outdoor ai</p><p>5 0.70193452 <a title="245-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-21-Will_Tiger_Woods_catch_Jack_Nicklaus%3F__And_a_discussion_of_the_virtues_of_using_continuous_data_even_if_your_goal_is_discrete_prediction.html">1387 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-21-Will Tiger Woods catch Jack Nicklaus?

<p>Introduction: I know next to nothing about golf.  My mini-golf scores typically approach the maximum of 7 per hole, and I’ve never actually played macro-golf.  I did publish a paper on golf once ( A Probability Model for Golf Putting , with Deb Nolan), but it’s not so rare for people to publish papers on topics they know nothing about.  Those who can’t, research.

I’ve already gone on record  two years ago  with the reason why he won’t, but now I’m looking at it from a non-psychological perspective. Given the history of the majors, what how far above the average _for other great golfers_ does Tiger have to perform?


Here’s the procedure I’ve been working on:

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.

Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers   


Virgil Gligor Carnegie Mellon University 


We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scams/deception. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced</p><p>6 0.91237891 <a title="245-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-26-Milo_and_Milo.html">824 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-26-Milo and Milo</a></p>

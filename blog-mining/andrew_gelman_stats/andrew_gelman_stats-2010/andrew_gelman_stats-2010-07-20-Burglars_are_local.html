<p>Introduction: The title of  this post  by Sanjay Srivastava illustrates an annoying misconception that’s crept into the (otherwise delightful) recent  publicity  related to my  article  with Hal Stern, he difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant.
 
When people bring this up, they keep referring to the difference between p=0.05 and p=0.06, making the familiar (and correct) point about the arbitrariness of the conventional p-value threshold of 0.05.  And, sure, I agree with this, but everybody knows that already.
 
The point Hal and I were making was that even apparently large differences in p-values are not statistically significant. For example, if you have one study with z=2.5 (almost significant at the 1% level!) and another with z=1 (not statistically significant at all, only 1 se from zero!), then their difference has a z of about 1 (again, not statistically significant at all). So it’s not just a comparison of 0.05 vs. 0.06, even a differenc</p><p>3 0.13271871 <a title="156-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-17-%E2%80%9CStop_and_frisk%E2%80%9D_statistics.html">1942 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-17-“Stop and frisk” statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen  brings up  one of my research topics:
  
In New York City, blacks make up a quarter of the population, yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects — almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.


Those statistics represent the justification for New York City’s controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters, then it ought to be young black males whom the police stop and frisk.
  
I have two comments on this.  First,  my research with Jeff Fagan and Alex Kiss  (based on data from the late 1990s, so maybe things have changed) found that the NYPD was stopping blacks and hispanics at a rate  higher  than their previous arrest rates:
  
To briefly summarize our findings, blacks and Hispanics represented 51% and 33% of the stops while representing only 26% and 24% of the New York City population. Compared with the number of arrests of</p><p>4 0.1043745 <a title="156-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-10-The_statistical_significance_filter.html">899 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-10-The statistical significance filter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

Brain scans may be able to predict what you will do better than you can yourself . . .  They found a way to interpret “real time” brain images to show whether people who viewed messages about using sunscreen would actually use sunscreen during the following week.


The scans were more accurate than the volunteers were, Emily Falk and colleagues at the University of California Los Angeles reported in the Journal of Neuroscience. . . .


About half the volunteers had correctly predicted whether they would use sunscreen. The research team analyzed and re-analyzed the MRI scans to see if they could find any brain activity that would do better.


Activity in one area of the brain, a particular part of the medial prefrontal cortex, provided the best information.


“From this region of the brain, we can predict for about three-quarters of the people whether they will increase their use of sunscreen beyond what they say they will do,” Lieberman said.

<p>Introduction: False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant 
  
[I]t is unacceptably easy to publish “statistically significant” evidence consistent with any hypothesis.


The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?


It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields “statistical significance,” and to then report only what “worked.” The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at leas</p><p>4 0.73277807 <a title="156-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-23-Scientists_can_read_your_mind_._._._as_long_as_the%E2%80%99re_allowed_to_look_at_more_than_one_place_in_your_brain_and_then_make_a_prediction_after_seeing_what_you_actually_did.html">106 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-23-Scientists can read your mind . . . as long as the’re allowed to look at more than one place in your brain and then make a prediction after seeing what you actually did</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  makes sense:
 
In the land of fiction, it’s the criminal’s modus operandi – his method of entry, his taste for certain jewellery and so forth – that can be used by detectives to identify his handiwork. The reality according to a new analysis of solved burglaries in the Northamptonshire region of England is that these aspects of criminal behaviour are on their own unreliable as identifying markers, most likely because they are dictated by circumstances rather than the criminal’s taste and style. However, the geographical spread and timing of a burglar’s crimes are distinctive, and could help with police investigations.
 
And, as a bonus,  more  Tourette’s pride!
 
P.S.  On yet another unrelated topic from the same blog, I wonder if the researchers in  this study  are aware that  the difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant .</p><p>2 0.87932789 <a title="156-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-19-The_free_cup_and_the_extra_dollar%3A__A_speculation_in_philosophy.html">668 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-19-The free cup and the extra dollar:  A speculation in philosophy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The following is an essay into a topic I know next to nothing about.
 
As part of our endless discussion of Dilbert and Charlie Sheen, commenter Fraac  linked  to a blog by philosopher Edouard Machery, who tells a  fascinating story :
  
How do we think about the intentional nature of actions? And how do people with an impaired mindreading capacity think about it?


Consider the following probes: 


The Free-Cup Case

 
Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, ‘I don’t care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.’ Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a commemorative cup. Did Joe intentionally obtain the commemorative cup?

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>4 0.8363905 <a title="156-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-24-PPS_in_Georgia.html">107 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-24-PPS in Georgia</a></p>

I’m working at a non-profit organization called CRRC in the Republic of Georgia.
      
I’m having a methodological problem and I saw the syllabus for your sampling class online and thought I might be able to ask you about it?


We do a lot of complex surveys nationwide; our typical sample design is as follows:


- stratify by rural/urban/capital 
- sub-stratify the rural and urban strata into NE/NW/SE/SW geographic quadrants 
- select voting precincts as PSUs 
- select households as SSUs 
- select individual respondents as TSUs


I’m relatively new here, and past practice has been to sample voting precincts with probability proportional to size.  It’s desirable because it’s not logistically feasible for us to vary the number of interviews per precinct with precinct size, so it makes the selection probabilities for households more even across precinct sizes. However, I have a complex sampling textbook (Lohr 1999), and it explains how complex it is to calculate sel</p><p>5 0.82307488 <a title="156-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-07-QB2.html">260 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-07-QB2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Berri writes:
  
Saw  you had a post  on the research I did with Rob Simmons on the NFL draft.  I have attached the article.  This article has not officially been published, so please don’t post this on-line.


The post you linked to states the following:   “On his blog, Berri says he restricts the analysis to QBs who have played more than 500 downs, or for 5 years. He also looks at per-play statistics, like touchdowns per game, to counter what he considers an opportunity bias.”


Two points:  First of all, we did not look at touchdowns per game (that is not a per play stat).  More importantly —  as this post indicates  — we did far more than just look at data after five years. 


We did mention the five year result, but directly below that discussion (and I mean, directly below), the following sentences appear.

 
Our data set runs from 1970 to 2007 (adjustments were made for how performance changed over time).

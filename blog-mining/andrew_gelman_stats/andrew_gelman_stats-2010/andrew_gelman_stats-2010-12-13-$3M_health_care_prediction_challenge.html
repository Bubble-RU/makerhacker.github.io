<p>Introduction: Harold Pollack writes:
  
 
Over the past three years, we have experienced an amazing number of political, economic, and legislative trials. I suppose it’s human nature to respond to such events by doubling down on our own prior strongly-held beliefs. Health care reform/TARP/stimulus, whatever–that proves that I am even more right than I thought I was!


That’s really too bad. We’ve been through some hard trials recently, in multiple senses. We’ve been tested by difficult times. We’ve also had the opportunity to see many of our beliefs tested through real-world experiments that should challenge our ideological, strategic, and policy views. Anyone active and attentive should be thinking differently about _something_ important after having witnessed so much history being made so quickly on so many different fronts.


Have your own views changed on any basic issues of domestic policy? I’m not so much interested in your assessment of particular politicians or specific political tactics.

<p>Introduction: Rhoderick Machekano writes:
  
I have a design question which has been bothering me and wonder if you can clear for me. In my line of work, we often conveniently select health centers and from those sample patients. When I am doing sample size estimation under this design do I account for the design effect – since I expect outcomes in patients from the same health center to be correlated? Given that I didn’t random sample the health facilities, is my only limitation that I cannot generalize the results and make group level comparisons in the analysis?
  
My response:
 
You can generalize the results even if you didn’t randomly sample the health facilities.  The only thing is that your generalization applies to the implicit population of facilities to which your sample is representative.  You could try to move further on this by considering facility-level predictors.  Regarding sample size estimation, see  chapter 20 .</p><p>6 0.11124372 <a title="465-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-24-Question_14_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1341 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-24-Question 14 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

 Robert Zubrin  writes in  “How Much Is an Astronaut’s Life Worth?”  ( Reason ,  Feb 2012 ):
     
…policy analyst John D. Graham and his colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found in 1997 that the median cost for lifesaving expenditures and regulations by the U.S. government in the health care, residential, transportation, and occupational areas ranges from about $1 million to $3 million spent per life saved in today’s dollars. The only marked exception to this pattern occurs in the area of environmental health protection (such as the Superfund program) which costs about $200 million per life saved.


Graham and his colleagues call the latter kind of inefficiency “ statistical murder ,” since thousands of additional lives could be saved each year if the money were used more cost-effectively. To avoid such deadly waste, the Department of Transportation has a policy of rejecting any proposed safety expenditure that costs more than $3</p><p>4 0.69845986 <a title="465-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-04-Do_you_have_any_idea_what_you%E2%80%99re_talking_about%3F.html">645 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-04-Do you have any idea what you’re talking about?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We all have opinions about the federal budget and how it should be spent. Infrequently, those opinions are informed by some knowledge about where the money actually goes.  It turns out that most people don’t have a clue.  What about you?  Here, take this poll/quiz and then compare your answers to (1) what other people said, in a CNN poll that asked about these same items and (2) compare your answers to the real answers.
 
Quiz is below the fold.
  

 
The questions below are from  a CNN poll.  
 
========
 
Think about all the money that the federal government spent last year. I’m going to name a few federal programs and for each one, I’d like you to estimate what percentage of the federal government’s budget last year was spent on each of those programs.

 Medicaid — the federal health program for the poor

<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)


This does not appear to work since it wi</p><p>4 0.93085718 <a title="465-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-08-%E2%80%9CWhat_do_you_think_about_curved_lines_connecting_discrete_data-points%3F%E2%80%9D.html">134 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-08-“What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

<p>Introduction: My C-oriented Stan collaborators have convinced me to use underscore (_) rather than dot (.) as much as possible in expressions in R.  For example, I can name a variable n_years rather than n.years.  This is fine.  But I’m getting annoyed because I need to press the shift key every time I type the underscore.
 
What do people do about this?  I know that it’s easy enough to reassign keys (I could, for example, assign underscore to backslash, which I never use).  I’m just wondering what C programmers actually do.  Do they reassign the key or do they just get used to pressing Shift?
 
P.S.  In comments, Ben Hyde  points  to Google’s R style guide, which recommends that variable names use dots,  not  underscore or camel case, for variable names (for example, “avg.clicks” rather than “avg_Clicks” or “avgClicks”).  I think they’re recommending this to be consistent with  R coding conventions .
 
I am switching to underscores in R variable names to be consistent with C.

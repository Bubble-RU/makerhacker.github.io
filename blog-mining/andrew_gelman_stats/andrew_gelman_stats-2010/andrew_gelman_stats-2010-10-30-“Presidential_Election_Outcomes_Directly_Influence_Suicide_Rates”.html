<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.
  
I  disagreed , saying that Christakis wasn’t giving social science research enough credit:
  
I’m no economist so I can let others discuss the bit about “monopoly power is bad for markets.” I assume that the study by</p><p>3 0.13357699 <a title="382-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-An_Olympic_size_swimming_pool_full_of_lithium_water.html">179 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-An Olympic size swimming pool full of lithium water</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.12610982 <a title="382-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-21-Defensive_political_science_responds_defensively_to_an_attack_on_social_science.html">1949 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-21-Defensive political science responds defensively to an attack on social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis, a medical scientist perhaps best known for his  controversial  claim (see also  here ), based on joint work with James Fowler, that obesity is contagious,  writes : 
  
  
The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .


I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality.

Unless I missed it, you haven’t commented on the recent  article  of Michael Bang Peterson [with Daniel Sznycer, Aaron Sell, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby].  It seems to have been reviewed extensively in the lay press.  A typical example is  here .  This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

<p>Introduction: Commenter Tggp  links  to a criticism of science journalist Sharon Begley by science journalist Matthew Hutson.  I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”
 
Hutson  writes :

<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.

<p>Introduction: Chris Chambers pointed me to a blog by someone called Neuroskeptic who  suggested  that I preregister my political science studies:
  
So when Andrew Gelman (let’s say) is going to start using a new approach, he goes on Twitter, or on his blog, and posts a bare-bones summary of what he’s going to do. Then he does it. If he finds something interesting, he writes it up as a paper, citing that tweet or post as his preregistration. . . .
  
I think this approach has some benefits but doesn’t really address the issues of preregistration that concern me—but I’d like to spend an entire blog post explaining why.  I have two key points:
 
1.  If your study is crap, preregistration might fix it.  Preregistration is fine—indeed, the wide acceptance of preregistration might well motivate researchers to not do so many crap studies—but it doesn’t solve fundamental problems of experimental design.
 
2.  “Preregistration” seems to mean different things in different scenarios:

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.

<p>Introduction: This came in the spam the other day:
  
College Station, TX–August 16, 2010–Change and hope were central themes to the November 2008 U.S. presidential election. A new longitudinal study published in the September issue of  Social Science Quarterly   analyzes suicide rates at a state level from 1981ï¼2005 and determines that presidential election outcomes directly influence suicide rates among voters.


In states where the majority of voters supported the national election winner suicide rates decreased. However, counter-intuitively, suicide rates decreased even more dramatically in states where the majority of voters supported the election loser (4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 lower for females). This article is the first in its field to focus on candidate and state-specific outcomes in relation to suicide rates. Prior research on this topic focused on whether the election process itself influenced suicide rates, and found that suicide rates fell during the election season.

<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):
 
   
 
Anyway, with all this, I was primed to be interested in a recent  study  by psychologist</p><p>4 0.95011592 <a title="382-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-03-Is_Harvard_hurting_poor_kids_by_cutting_tuition_for_the_upper_middle_class%3F.html">598 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-03-Is Harvard hurting poor kids by cutting tuition for the upper middle class?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Timothy Noah  reports :
  
At the end of 2007, Harvard announced that it would limit tuition to no more than 10 percent of family income for families earning up to $180,000. (It also eliminated all loans, following a trail blazed by Princeton, and stopped including home equity in its calculations of family wealth.) Yale saw and raised to $200,000, and other wealthy colleges weighed in with variations.
  
Noah argues that this is a bad thing because it encourages other colleges to give tuition breaks to families with six-figure incomes, thus sucking up money that could otherwise go to reduce tuition for lower-income students.  For example:
  
Roger Lehecka, a former dean of students at Columbia, and Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies there, wrote in the New York Times that Harvard’s initiative was “good news for students at Harvard or Yale” but “bad news” for everyone else. “The problem,” they explained, “is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale’s</p><p>5 0.93230546 <a title="382-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-28-World_Economic_Forum_Data_Visualization_Challenge.html">378 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-28-World Economic Forum Data Visualization Challenge</a></p>

The dataset primarily contains the experts’ opinions on which global / regional / industrial agenda council of the WEF they would benefit from by interacting with the most. It occurs to me that this dataset can be thought of as an instance of a social networking dynamics, in that it represents the preferences of individuals towards belonging or not belonging to a particular group within the network. It is these ‘groups’ that must be identified to solve the problem. Under what conditions would this hypothesis be valid?


I have a hunch that dimensionality reduction will not necessarily help me visualize this data satisfactorily. They also need to be complemented by the way social networks detect cliques amongst their members.

</p><p>3 Act 3        OK, I realized I needed more explanation, so I added a few paragraphs (see  here ), saying what was on the horizontal and vertical axis of the graphs and explicitly stating that those graphs demonstrated that the polls are indeed informative in predicting the election. [sent-21, score-0.825]
</p><p>4 In particular, many people thought that the main message of the graphs was that polls are more predictive of the vote as the election approaches. [sent-23, score-0.771]
</p><p>5 Our point was that, even a year ahead of time, the generic ballot polls are good predictors, if appropriately piped through a linear model (as estimated from past data). [sent-27, score-0.817]
</p><p>6 Here’s a try:   Les Francis, who describes himself as a political operative real-world experience as former executive director of the Democratic National Committee,  wrote this  today on Frum Forum:    I don’t need any polls to tell me that Republicans will do well in November.

</p><p>7 The “out” party almost always shows significant gains in the first midterm election of a new President. [sent-60, score-0.714]
</p><p>8 As a frequent user of polls myself, this jumped out at me. [sent-61, score-0.378]
</p><p>9 It may be true that Francis doesn’t need any polls to draw his conclusions–although it would be to know this, as Francis is certainly aware of the polls at this time. [sent-62, score-0.807]
</p><p>10 On the other hand, I think the polls can tell us a lot more than Francis gives them credit for. [sent-63, score-0.453]
</p><p>11 Not 2002, since Bush’s party actually gained seats in that midterm election. [sent-65, score-0.536]
</p><p>12 Perhaps the polls actually are useful in forecasting whether the out-party’s midterm gains will be closer to the 54 seats of 1994, the 15 seats of 1982, or the 2-seat pickup of 1962. [sent-73, score-1.303]
</p><p>13 But Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien actually found out that the generic ballot predicts the election very well, even many months before the election. [sent-77, score-0.513]
</p><p>14 The key is that you can’t just take the generic ballot number straight; you need to adjust it, which Bafumi et al. [sent-78, score-0.487]
</p><p>15 Once you adjust for this (which you can do, using past election results), the generic polls are impressive predictors of the vote on Election Day. [sent-81, score-0.919]
</p><p>16 To work with generic polls today, we could use one of the later graphs on the above grid to make a projection. [sent-94, score-0.802]
</p><p>17 But my real point here is not the specific prediction but just that the polls tell us a lot. [sent-95, score-0.504]
</p><p>18 Through some statistical analysis we can use the polls to learn a lot more than that the out party will likely show “significant gains” which might be somewhere between 2 and 54 seats in the House. [sent-96, score-0.737]
</p><p>19 , can be valuable but he’s doing himself no favors by dismissing the polls or by making statements such as “Barack Obama’s 2008 winning margin was somewhat out of synch with the political alignment of the country at the time,” which is unsupported by any data I’ve seen. [sent-98, score-0.475]

<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>3 0.35425332 <a title="210-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-27-Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien_predict_a_50-seat_loss_for_Democrats_in_November.html">237 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-27-Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien predict a 50-seat loss for Democrats in November</a></p>
<p>Introduction: They  write :
  
How many House seats will the Republicans gain in 2010? . . . Our methodology replicates that for our ultimately successful forecast of the 2006 midterm. Two weeks before Election Day in 2006, we posted  a prediction that the Democrats would gain 32 seats and recapture the House majority. The Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006. Our current forecast for 2010 shows that the Republicans are likely to regain the House majority. . . . the most likely scenario is  a Republican majority in the neighborhood of 229 seats versus 206 for the Democrats for a 50-seat loss for the Democrats .
  
How do they do it?  First, they predict the national two-party vote using the generic polls (asking voters which party they plan to vote for in the November congressional elections).  Then they apply the national vote swing on a district-by-district level to predict the outcome in each district.  They account for uncertainty in their predictions (I assume by using a model similar to what  Gar</p><p>4 0.2891672 <a title="210-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>5 0.27634525 <a title="210-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010.

Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>5 0.85067236 <a title="210-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-Comparison_of_forecasts_for_the_2010_congressional_elections.html">270 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-Comparison of forecasts for the 2010 congressional elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>6 0.81809992 <a title="210-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-02-%E2%80%9CIl_y_a_beaucoup_de_candidats_d%C3%A9mocrates%2C_et_leurs_id%C3%A9ologies_ne_sont_pas_tr%C3%A8s_diff%C3%A9rentes._Et_la_participation_est_impr%C3%A9visible.%E2%80%9D.html">2005 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-02-“Il y a beaucoup de candidats démocrates, et leurs idéologies ne sont pas très différentes.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog comments made me rethink how to express disagreement when I write.  I’ll first display my original blog entry, then some of the comments, then my reaction, and finally my new approach.  As usual with negative comments, my first reaction was to be upset, but once the hurt feelings went away, I realized that these dudes had a point.
 
 Act 1 
 
A few days I ago, I posted the following on 538:
  
Self-described “ political operative ” Les Francis, with real-world experience as former executive director of the Democratic National Committee:

 
I don’t need any polls to tell me that Republicans will do well in November. The “out” party almost always shows significant gains in the first midterm election of a new President. 
 

 Political scientists  Joe Bafumi, Bob Erikson, and Chris Wlezien, from elite, out-of-touch, ivory-tower institutions Dartmouth, Columbia, and Temple Universities:

<p>Introduction: Jeff Ratto points me to  this  news article by Dean Baker reporting the work of three economists, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who  found  errors in a much-cited  article  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff analyzing historical statistics of economic growth and public debt.  Mike Konczal  provides  a clear summary; that’s where I got the above image.
 
 Errors in data processing and data analysis 
 
It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff flubbed it.  Herndon et al. write of “spreadsheet errors, omission of available data, weighting, and transcription.”  The spreadsheet errors are the most embarrassing, but the other choices in data analysis seem pretty bad too.  It can be tough to work with small datasets, so I have sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, but it does look like they were jumping to conclusions in their paper.  Perhaps the urgency of the topic moved them to publish as fast as possible rather than carefully considering the impact of their data-analytic choi</p><p>3 0.94780892 <a title="210-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-23-Peter_Bartlett_on_model_complexity_and_sample_size.html">1636 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-23-Peter Bartlett on model complexity and sample size</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Zach Shahn saw  this  and writes:
  
I just heard  a talk by Peter Bartlett  about model selection in “unlimited” data situations that essentially addresses this curve.


He talks about the problem of model selection given a computational budget (rather than given a sample size). You can either use your computational budget to get more data or fit a more complex model. He shows that you can get oracle inequalities for model selection algorithms under this paradigm (as long as the candidate models are nested).
  
I can’t follow all the details but it looks cool!  This is what they should be teaching in theoretical statistics class, instead of sufficient statistics and the Neyman-Pearson lemma and all that other old stuff.
 
Zach also asks:
  
I have a question about political science.  I always hear that the direction of the economy is one of the best predictors of election outcome.

<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.

I would love to see a blog entry on  this article , Bayesian Model Selection in High-Dimensional Settings, by Valen Johnson and David Rossell.  The simulation results are very encouraging although the choice of colors for some of the graphics is unfortunate.  Unless I am colorblind in some way that I am unaware of, they have two thin charcoal lines that are indistinguishable.
  
When Dave Judkins puts in a request, I’ll respond.  Also, I’m always happy to see a new Val Johnson paper.  Val and I are contemporaries—he and I got our PhD’s at around the same time, with both of us working on Bayesian image reconstruction, then in the early 1990s Val was part of the legendary group at Duke’s Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences—a veritable ’27 Yankees featuring Mike West, Merlise Clyde, Michael Lavine, Dave Higdon, Peter Mueller, Val, and a bunch of others.

I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.

Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability.

I am trying to fit my data using the scaled inverse wishart model you mentioned in your book, Data analysis using regression and hierarchical models. Instead of using a uniform prior on the scale parameters, I try to use a log-normal distribution prior. However, I found that the individual coefficients don’t shrink much to a certain value even a highly informative prior (with extremely low variance) is considered. The coefficients are just very close to their least-squares estimations. Is it because of the log-normal prior I’m using or I’m wrong somewhere?
  
My reply:  If your priors are concentrated enough at zero variance, then yeah, the posterior estimates of the parameters should be pulled (almost) all the way to zero.  If this isn’t happening, you got a problem.  So as a start I’d try putting in some really strong priors concentrated at 0 (for example, N(0,.1^2)) and checking that you get a sensible answer.  If not, you might well have a bug.

<p>Introduction: Following up on Christian’s  post  [link fixed] on the topic, I’d like to offer a few thoughts of my own.
 
In BDA, we express the idea that a noninformative prior is a placeholder:  you can use the noninformative prior to get the analysis started, then if your posterior distribution is less informative than you would like, or if it does not make sense, you can go back and add prior information.
 
Same thing for the data model (the “likelihood”), for that matter:  it often makes sense to start with something simple and conventional and then go from there.
 
So, in that sense, noninformative priors are no big deal, they’re just a way to get started.  Just don’t take them too seriously.
 
Traditionally in statistics we’ve worked with the paradigm of a single highly informative dataset with only weak external information.  But if the data are sparse and prior information is strong, we have to think differently.

I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.

<p>Introduction: Nick Polson and James Scott  write :
  
We generalize the half-Cauchy prior for a global scale parameter to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Finally, we prove a result that characterizes the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators under all priors in the class. These arguments provide an alternative, classical justification for the use of the half-Cauchy prior in Bayesian hierarchical models, complementing the arguments in Gelman (2006).
  
This makes me happy, of course.  It’s great to be validated.
 
The only think I didn’t catch is how they set the scale parameter for the half-Cauchy prior.  In my 2006 paper I frame it as a weakly informative prior and recommend that the scale be set based on actual prior knowledge.  But Polson and Scott are talking about a default choice.

I read with great interest your 2008  paper  [with Aleks Jakulin, Grazia Pittau, and Yu-Sung Su] on weakly informative priors for logistic regression and also followed an interesting discussion on your blog. This discussion was within Bayesian community in relation to the validity of priors. However i would like to approach it rather from a more broad perspective on predictive modeling bringing in the ideas from machine/statistical learning approach”.  Actually you were the first to bring it up by mentioning in your paper “borrowing ideas from computer science” on cross-validation when comparing predictive ability of your proposed priors with other choices.


However, using cross-validation for comparing method performance is not the only or primary use of CV in machine-learning. Most of machine learning methods have some “meta” or complexity parameters and use cross-validation to tune them up.

<p>Introduction: John Lawson writes:
  
I have been experimenting using Bayesian Methods to estimate variance components, and I have noticed that even when I use a noninformative prior, my estimates are never close to the method of moments or REML estimates. In every case I have tried, the sum of the Bayesian estimated variance components is always larger than the sum of the estimates obtained by method of moments or REML.
      
For data sets I have used that arise from a simple one-way random effects model, the Bayesian estimates of the between groups variance component is usually larger than the method of moments or REML estimates. When I use a uniform prior on the between standard deviation (as you recommended in  your 2006 paper ) rather than an inverse gamma prior on the between variance component, the between variance component is usually reduced.  However, for the dyestuff data in Davies(1949, p74), the opposite appears to be the case.

<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>3 0.97063351 <a title="63-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>4 0.96975636 <a title="63-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-Setting_aside_the_politics%2C_the_debate_over_the_new_health-care_study_reveals_that_we%E2%80%99re_moving_to_a_new_high_standard_of_statistical_journalism.html">1838 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-Setting aside the politics, the debate over the new health-care study reveals that we’re moving to a new high standard of statistical journalism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing to this  news article  by Megan McArdle discussing a recent study of Medicaid recipients, Jonathan Falk writes:
  
Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.
 

and

 
A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: Sharad had a survey sampling question:
  
We’re trying to use mechanical turk to conduct some surveys, and have quickly discovered that turkers tend to be quite young. We’d really like a representative sample of the U.S., or at the least be able to recruit a diverse enough sample from turk that we can post-stratify to adjust the estimates. The approach we ended up taking is to pay turkers a small amount to answer a couple of screening questions (age & sex), and then probabilistically recruit individuals to complete the full survey (for more money) based on the estimated turk population parameters and our desired target distribution. We use rejection sampling, so the end result is that individuals who are invited to take the full survey look as if they came from a representative sample, at least in terms of age and sex. I’m wondering whether this sort of technique—a two step design in which participants are first screened and then probabilistically selected to mimic a target distributio</p><p>6 0.96834719 <a title="63-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-06-Question_27_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1368 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-06-Question 27 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

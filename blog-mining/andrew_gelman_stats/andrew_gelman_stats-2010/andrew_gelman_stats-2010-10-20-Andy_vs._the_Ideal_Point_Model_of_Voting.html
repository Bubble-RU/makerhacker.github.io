</p><p>2 Executive Summary    The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote  for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is  monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position,  with direction determined by the outcome coding. [sent-5, score-1.242]
</p><p>3 y[i] is the vote by senator j[i] on bill k[i]. [sent-11, score-1.087]
</p><p>4 The value alpha[j] is  the ideal point of senator j and the value beta[k] the position of  bill k. [sent-12, score-1.318]
</p><p>5 ”   To identify the parameters, we can center the alphas around 0 and  assume that liberal senators will have smaller alpha[j] and conservative  senators larger alpha[j] values. [sent-16, score-0.908]
</p><p>6 On the same scale, more conservative  bills will have larger beta[k] and more liberal bills smaller beta[k]. [sent-17, score-0.792]
</p><p>7 Given a vote on bill k with position beta[k], the further the  senator’s position is to the right (i. [sent-21, score-1.148]
</p><p>8 It’s colored red because a conservative bill is  coded with a vote of y[i]=1 being for the bill. [sent-44, score-1.043]
</p><p>9 Thus the red curve is  the number of votes for a conservative bill based on its position. [sent-45, score-0.879]
</p><p>10 The blue curve shows the number of votes for a  liberal bill based on its position. [sent-49, score-0.911]
</p><p>11 Thus the coding of a bill makes a  difference to the position at which it’ll pass as well as the  direction of movement which increases likelihood of passage. [sent-50, score-0.887]
</p><p>12 Specifically, for a bill coded as conservative, the more liberal its  position, the more likeliy it is to pass. [sent-51, score-0.813]
</p><p>13 Making a bill more  liberal or more conservative has the same effect on senators of both  parties, making them either more or less likely to vote for the bill,  depending on how the coding is chosen. [sent-54, score-1.43]
</p><p>14 Flipping the coding actually  changes the point at which a bill will pass, and seems redundant given  that a bill’s position, beta[k], is also coding a bill’s  liberal/conservative orientation. [sent-55, score-0.669]
</p><p>15 A More Concrete Example     For concreteness, consider the US$ 800+   2009  stimulus bill , a liberal bill which squeaked through the  U. [sent-56, score-1.298]
</p><p>16 If the  bill moves to the left, beta[k] decreases, so alpha[i]-beta[k]  inreases, and the vote is more likely to be 1 (against the stimulus). [sent-64, score-0.835]
</p><p>17 Thus no matter what the senator’s ideal point is, they’re more likely  to vote against the bill as the target amount becomes more liberal  (rises). [sent-65, score-1.246]
</p><p>18 If the bill moves to the right, presumably corresponding to  a smaller stimulus package, beta[k] increases, so alpha[i]-beta[k]  decreases, so the vote is more likely to be 0 (for the stimulus). [sent-66, score-1.166]
</p><p>19 Then, the further the bill got away from the senator’s ideal in either  direction, the more likely they’d be to vote against it, rather than  assuming their preference for the bill goes up in one direction of  change and down in the other relative to their indifference point. [sent-71, score-1.556]
</p><p>20 A hypothetical bill with a position to the left (or right) of all  the senators will still act monotonically, but now with the expected  directional effect, namely increasing expected votes as the bill  approaches the senator’s ideal points. [sent-72, score-2.038]

<p>Introduction: On the basis of two papers and because it is completely obvious, we (meaning  me , Justin, and  John ) predict that Elena Kagan will get confirmed to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  But we also want to see how close we can come to predicting the votes for and against.
 
We actually have two sets of predictions, both using the MRP technique discussed previously on this blog.  The first is based on our  recent paper  in the  Journal of Politics  showing that support for the nominee in a senator’s home state plays a striking role in whether she or he votes to confirm the nominee.  The second is based on a  new working paper  extending “basic” MRP to show that senators respond far more to their co-partisans than the median voter in their home states.  Usually, our vote “predictions” do not differ much, but there is a group of senators who are predicted to vote yes for Kagan with a probability around 50% and the two sets of predictions thus differ for Kagan more than usual.</p><p>5 0.17691226 <a title="355-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-03-The_Employment_Nondiscrimination_Act_is_overwhelmingly_popular_in_nearly_every_one_of_the_50_states.html">2087 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-03-The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is overwhelmingly popular in nearly every one of the 50 states</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above graph shows the estimated support, by state, for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a gay rights bill that the Senate will be voting on this Monday.  The estimates were constructed by Kate Krimmel, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips using multilevel regression and poststratification.
 
Check out that graph again.  The scale goes from 20% to 80%, but  every state  is in the yellow-to-red range.  Support for a law making it illegal to discriminate against gays has majority support in every state. And in most states the support is very strong.
 
And  here’s the research paper  by Krimmel, Lax, and Phillips, which begins:
  
Public majorities have supported several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress has responded slowly if at all. We address this puzzle through dyadic analysis of the opinion- vote relationship on 23 roll-call votes between 1993 and 2010, matching members of Congress to policy-specific opinion in their state or district.

<p>Introduction: Boris  writes :
  
 
By nearly all accounts, the Republicans looks set to take over the US House of Representatives in next week’s November 2010 general election. . . . Republicans, in this wave election that recalls 1994, look set to win not just swing districts, but also those districts that have been traditionally Democratic, or those with strong or longtime Democratic incumbents. Naturally, just as in 2008, this has led to overclaiming by jubilant conservatives and distraught liberals-though the adjectives were then reversed-that this portends a realignment in American politics. . . .


Republican moderates in Congress are often associated with two factors: 1) a liberal voting record earlier in their career, and 2) a liberal district. Of course, both are related, in the sense that ambitious moderates choose liberal districts to run in, and liberal districts weed out conservative candidates. . . . Given how competitive Republicans are in 2010, even in otherwise unfriendly territory,</p><p>4 0.69791359 <a title="355-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-07-Minor-league_Stats_Predict_Major-league_Performance%2C_Sarah_Palin%2C_and_Some_Differences_Between_Baseball_and_Politics.html">652 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-07-Minor-league Stats Predict Major-league Performance, Sarah Palin, and Some Differences Between Baseball and Politics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>2 0.95514166 <a title="355-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-Getting_into_hot_water_over_hot_graphics.html">225 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-Getting into hot water over hot graphics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression   
book (p. 317), using the U.S. Senate instead of the Supreme Court, and 
ignoring the dis</p><p>4 0.90975773 <a title="355-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-04-Inequality_and_health.html">127 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-04-Inequality and health</a></p>

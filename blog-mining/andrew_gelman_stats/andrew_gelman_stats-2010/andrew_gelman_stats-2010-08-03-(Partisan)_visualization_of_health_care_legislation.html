<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus  writes ,
  
An algorithm that is good at chess won’t help parsing sentences, and one that parses sentences likely won’t be much help playing chess.
  
That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.  I’d much rather have had twice as much detail on the first part of the life and then had the post-1972 era compr</p><p>3 0.10790931 <a title="178-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-13-%243M_health_care_prediction_challenge.html">465 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-13-$3M health care prediction challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:

<p>Introduction: A friend asks the above question and writes:
  
 This article  left me thinking – how could the IRS not notice that this guy didn’t file taxes for several years? Don’t they run checks and notice if you miss a year? If I write a check our of order, there’s an asterisk next to the check number in my next bank statement showing that there was a gap in the sequence.


If you ran the IRS, wouldn’t you do this: SSNs are issued sequentially. Once a SSN reaches 18, expect it to file a return. If it doesn’t, mail out a postage paid letter asking why not with check boxes such as Student, Unemployed, etc. Follow up at reasonable intervals. Eventually every SSN should be filing a return, or have an international address. Yes this is intrusive, but my goal is only to maximize tax revenue. Surely people who do this for a living could come up with something more elegant.
  
My response:
 
I dunno, maybe some confidentiality rules?  The other thing is that I’m guessing that IRS gets lots of pushback w</p><p>5 0.091280118 <a title="178-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-28-The_mathematics_of_democracy.html">239 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-28-The mathematics of democracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was sent a copy of “Numbers Rule:  The Vexing Mathematics of Democracy, from Plato to the Present,” by George Szpiro.  It’s an interesting book that I think a lot of people will like, going over a bunch of voting paradoxes in the context of historical stories.  Some of the topics (Arrow’s theorem and its recent refinements) are more interesting than others (the always nauseatingly boring (to me) of the “Alabama paradox” and various rules about which states get one extra House seat; for some reason people are always writing about this topic about which I could care less).  But you can pick and choose among the chapters, so unevenness isn’t really such a problem.
 
One thing that fascinates me about the topic of mathematics and representation is how many different ways there are to look at it.
  

 
In 2002, I published a paper in Chance called Voting, Fairness, and Political Representation ( here’s a preprint version ; it later appeared, slightly revised, as a chapter in our  Quantita</p><p>6 0.088248648 <a title="178-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Unsurprisingly%2C_people_are_more_worried_about_the_economy_and_jobs_than_about_deficits.html">100 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Unsurprisingly, people are more worried about the economy and jobs than about deficits</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stephanie Evergreen writes:
  
 
Media, web design, and marketing have all created an environment where stakeholders – clients, program participants, funders – all expect high quality graphics and reporting that effectively conveys the valuable insights from evaluation work. Some in statistics and mathematics have used data visualization strategies to support more useful reporting of complex ideas. Global growing interest in improving communications has begun to take root in the evaluation field as well. But as anyone who has sat through a day’s worth of a conference or had to endure a dissertation-worthy evaluation report knows, evaluators still have a long way to go. To support the development of researchers and evaluators, some members of the American Evaluation Association are proposing a new TIG (Topical Interest Group) on Data Visualization and Reporting.

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: Congressman  Kevin Brady  from Texas  distributes this visualization of reformed  health care  in the US (click for a bigger picture):
 
   
 
Here’s a  PDF  at Brady’s page, and a local  copy  of it.
 
Complexity has its costs. Beyond the cost of writing it, learning it, following it, there’s also the cost of checking it. John Walker has some  funny examples  of what’s hidden in the almost 8000 pages of IRS code.
 
Text mining and applied statistics will solve all that, hopefully. Anyone interested in developing a pork detection system for the legislation? Or an analysis of how much entropy to the legal code did each congressman contribute?
 
There are already  spin   detectors , that help you detect whether the writer is a Democrat (“stimulus”, “health care”) or a Republican (“deficit spending”, “ObamaCare”).

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>5 0.89463365 <a title="178-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-04-Stan_in_L.A._this_Wed_3%3A30pm.html">1749 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-04-Stan in L.A. this Wed 3:30pm</a></p>

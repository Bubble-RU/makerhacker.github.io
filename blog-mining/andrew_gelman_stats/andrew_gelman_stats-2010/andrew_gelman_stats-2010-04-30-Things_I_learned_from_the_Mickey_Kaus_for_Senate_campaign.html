<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  writes :
  
I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years. The results tell the aggression story using street-level data very clearly  [click to</p><p>4 0.18082409 <a title="13-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-19-The_violent_crime_rate_was_about_75%25_higher_in_Detroit_than_in_Minneapolis_in_2009.html">353 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-19-The violent crime rate was about 75% higher in Detroit than in Minneapolis in 2009</a></p>

I’m surprised the difference is so small.  I would’ve thought the crime rate was something like 5 times higher in Detroit than in Minneapolis.  I guess Minneapolis must have some rough neighborhoods.  Or maybe it’s just that I don’t have a good framework for thinking about crime statistics.</p><p>5 0.13343464 <a title="13-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-12-Crime_novels_for_economists.html">1852 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-12-Crime novels for economists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on  this post  by Noah Smith on economics in science fiction, Mark Palko  writes  on economics in crime fiction.
 
Just as almost all science fiction is ultimately about politics, one could say that just about all crime fiction is about economics.
 
But if I had to pick one crime novelist with an economics focus, Iâ&euro;&trade;d pick George V. Higgins.  In one of his novels, his character Jerry Kennedy had a riff on the difference between guys who get a salary and guys who have to work for every dollar.  But, really, almost all his novels are full of economics.</p><p>6 0.12667643 <a title="13-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-21-Belief_in_hell_is_associated_with_lower_crime_rates.html">1386 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-21-Belief in hell is associated with lower crime rates</a></p>

<p>Introduction: See here  (if you care).
 
P.S.  Kaus writes that, when he was on William Bennett’s radio show, “Bennett immediately zeroed in on a key political mystery: Are African-American voters on board with the Democrats’ recent amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants program?”  I wonder if Kaus asked Bennett about  this quote :

<p>Introduction: I get suspicious when I hear unsourced claims that unnamed experts somewhere are making foolish statements.
 
For example, I recently came across this, from a Super Bowl-themed  article  from 2006 by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt:
  
As it happens, there is one betting strategy that will routinely beat a bookie, and you don’t even have to be smart to use it. One of the most undervalued N.F.L. bets is the home underdog — a team favored to lose but playing in its home stadium. If you had bet $5,000 on the home underdog in every N.F.L. game over the past two decades, you would be up about $150,000 by now (a winning rate of roughly 53 percent).
  
So far, so good.  I wonder if this pattern still holds.  But then Dubner and Levitt continue:
  
This fact has led some academics to conclude that bookmakers simply aren’t very smart. If an academic researcher can find this loophole, shouldn’t a professional bookie be able to?


But the fact is most bookies are doing just fine. So could it be</p><p>3 0.68227112 <a title="13-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>4 0.67428321 <a title="13-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>5 0.65411872 <a title="13-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-Flip_it_around.html">943 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-Flip it around</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  discusses  a radio interview on the effect of parents on children’s education.  In short, the interviewer (Stephen Dubner of Freakonomics fame) claims that the research shows that parents don’t have much influence on whether their children go to college.  The evidence is based on a comparison of adopted and non-adopted children.  Palko makes a convincing case that the statistical analysis (by economist Bruce Sacerdote) doesn’t show what Dubner says it shows.
 
I looked over the linked transcript, and overall I’m less unhappy than Palko is about the interview.  I agree that some of the causal implications are sloppy, and I think it’s a bit silly for the interviewer (Kai Ryssdal) to use celebrities as a benchmark.

<p>Introduction: See here  (if you care).
 
P.S.  Kaus writes that, when he was on William Bennett’s radio show, “Bennett immediately zeroed in on a key political mystery: Are African-American voters on board with the Democrats’ recent amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants program?”  I wonder if Kaus asked Bennett about  this quote :
  
But I [Bennett] do know that it’s true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could — if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down. 
  
As Brendan Nyhan notes, Bennett wasn’t actually  suggesting  that black babies be aborted–in fact, Bennett said, “That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down.”  Bennett definitely sounds like the go-to guy for a savvy discussion of the black vote!
  

 
P.P.S.  Just to clarify for those who might think that Bennett was simply calling-it-like-it-is, albeit in a politically incorrect style . . .

<p>Introduction: William Perkins, Mark Tygert, and Rachel Ward  write :
  
If a discrete probability distribution in a model being tested for goodness-of-fit is not close to uniform, then forming the Pearson χ2 statistic can involve division by nearly zero. This often leads to serious trouble in practice — even in the absence of round-off errors . . .
  
The problem is not merely that the chi-squared  statistic  doesn’t have the advertised chi-squared  distribution —a reference distribution can always be computed via simulation, either using the posterior predictive distribution or by conditioning on a point estimate of the cell expectations and then making a degrees-of-freedom sort of adjustment.
 
Rather, the problem is that, when there are lots of cells with near-zero expectation, the chi-squared test is mostly noise.
 
And this is not merely a theoretical problem.  It comes up in real examples.
 
Here’s one, taken from the classic 1992 genetics paper of Guo and Thomspson:

<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

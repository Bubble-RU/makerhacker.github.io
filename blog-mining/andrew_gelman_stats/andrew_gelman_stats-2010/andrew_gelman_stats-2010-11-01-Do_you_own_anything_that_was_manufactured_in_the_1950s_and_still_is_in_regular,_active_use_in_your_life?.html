P.S. to the commenters:  I’m taking the question to refer to things manufactured  in  the 1950s and not before!</p><p>2 0.1415094 <a title="387-tfidf-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-%E2%80%9CThe_comment_section_is_open%2C_but_I%E2%80%99m_not_going_to_read_them%E2%80%9D.html">1994 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-“The comment section is open, but I’m not going to read them”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>3 0.10962086 <a title="387-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-29-Why_%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1190 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-29-Why “Why”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In old books (and occasionally new books), you see the word “Why” used to indicate a pause or emphasis in dialogue.
 
For example, from 1952:
  
“Why, how perfectly simple!” she said to herself.  “The way to save Wilbur’s life is to play a trick on Zuckerman.  “If I can fool a bug,” thought Charlotte, “I can surely fool a man.  People are not as smart as bugs.”
  
That line about people and bugs was cute, but what really jumped out at me was the “Why.”  I don’t think I’ve ever ever heard anyone use “Why” in that way in conversation, but I see it all the time in books, and every time it’s jarring.
 
What’s the deal?  Is it that people used to talk that way?  Or is a Wasp thing, some regional speech pattern that was captured in books because it was considered standard conversational speech?  I suppose one way to learn more would be to watch a bunch of old movies.  I could sort of imagine Jimmy Stewart beginning his sentences with “Why” all the time.
 
Does anyone know more?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  a  blog  by Samuel Arbesman mocking people who are so lazy that they take the elevator from 1 to 2.  This reminds me of my own annoyance about a guy who worked in my building and did  not  take the elevator.  (For the full story, go  here  and search on “elevator.”)</p><p>5 0.08716663 <a title="387-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-18-%E2%80%9CHow_big_is_your_chance_of_dying_in_an_ordinary_play%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1945 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-18-“How big is your chance of dying in an ordinary play?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At first glance, that’s what I thought Tyler Cowen was  asking .
 
I assumed he was asking about the characters, not the audience, as watching a play seems like a pretty safe activity (A. Lincoln excepted).  Characters in plays die all the time.  I wonder what the chance is?  Something between 5% and 10%, I’d guess.
 
I’d guess your chance of dying (as a character) in a movie would be higher.  On the other hand, movies have lots of extras who just show up and leave; if you count them maybe the risk isn’t so high.  Perhaps the right way to do this is to weight people by screen time?
 
P.S.   The Mezzanine  aside, works of art and literature tend to focus on the dramatic moments of lives, so it makes sense that death will be overrepresented.</p><p>6 0.084725998 <a title="387-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Dodging_the_diplomats.html">232 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Dodging the diplomats</a></p>

You’ll get an extra prize if you can express the answer in an indirect way, without using the person’s name or being too obvious about it but making the identification clear enough that I know you know the answer.

<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.

<p>Introduction: In our Freakonomics:  What Went Wrong article, Kaiser and I wrote:
  
Levitt’s publishers characterize him as a “rogue economist,” yet he received his Ph.D. from MIT, holds the title of Alvin H. Baum Professor at the University of Chicago, and has served as editor of the completely mainstream Journal of Political Economy. Further “rogue” credentials revealed by Levitt’s online C.V. include an undergraduate degree from Harvard, a research fellowship with the American Bar Foundation, membership in the Harvard Society of Fellows, a fellowship at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a stint as a consultant for “Corporate Decisions, Inc.”
  
That’s all well and good, but, on the other hand, I too have degrees from Harvard and MIT and I also taught at the University of Chicago.  But what really clinches it is that this month I gave a talk for an organization called the Corporate Executive Board.  No kidding.
 
In my defense, I’ve never actually called myself a “rogue.”  But still .</p><p>6 0.99011624 <a title="387-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-16-Visualizations_of_NYPD_stop-and-frisk_data.html">1014 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-16-Visualizations of NYPD stop-and-frisk data</a></p>

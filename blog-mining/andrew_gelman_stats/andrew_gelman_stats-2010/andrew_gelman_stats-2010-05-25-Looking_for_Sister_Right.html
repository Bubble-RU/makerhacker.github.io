In their latest blog entry, okcupid uses its very large dating-site userbase to assess the progression of social and economic views with age, and (taking into account self-specified importance of economic and social views) the resulting political affiliations.  The final assessment is that the spectrum of views encompassed under “democrat” ends up being much broader than those under “republican”.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.15880167 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>4 0.15570644 <a title="50-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.
 
Bob writes:
  
Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’
 

What do we make of this?   Is there some hidden downside to actually running a national campaign?   Of course, money spent nationally is not spent on targeted local campaigns.   But that is always the case.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>6 0.14673468 <a title="50-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw_tax_update.html">366 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw tax update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reviewing a research article by Michael Spence and Sandile Hlatshwayo about globalization (a paper with the  sobering message  that “higher-paying jobs [are] likely to follow low-paying jobs in leaving US,” Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
It is also a useful corrective to the political conspiracy theories of changes in the income distribution. . .
  
Being not-so-blissfully ignorant of macroeconomics, I can focus on the political question, namely these conspiracy theories.
 
I’m not quite sure what Cowen is referring to here–he neglects to provide a link to the conspiracy theories–but I’m guessing he’s referring to the famous graph by  Piketty and Saez  showing how very high-end incomes (top 1% or 0.1%) have, since the 1970s, risen much more dramatically in the U.S. than in other countries, along with claims by Paul Krugman and others that much of this difference can be explained by political changes in the U.S.  In particular, top tax rates in the U.S. have declined since the 1970s and the p</p><p>3 0.76810127 <a title="50-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-23-Surveys_show_Americans_are_populist_class_warriors%2C_except_when_they_aren%E2%80%99t.html">1079 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-23-Surveys show Americans are populist class warriors, except when they aren’t</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From my  New York Times blog  today, here’s an example of how contemporaneous poll results can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
 
Recently in the New Republic,  William Galston  shared some recent findings from Gallup:
  
Respondents were asked to categorize three economic objectives as extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not important. Here’s what they said:


Extremely/very important          Somewhat/not important


Grow and expand the economy                                         82                                            18


Increase equality of opportunity for people to get ahead                                             70                                            30

<p>Introduction: Psychology is a universal science of human nature, whereas political science is centered on the study of particular historical events and trends.  Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that when a psychologist looks at politics, he presents ideas that are thought-provoking but are too general to quite work.  This is fine; political scientists can then take such ideas and try to adapt them more closely to particular circumstances.
 
The psychologist I’m thinking about here is Steven Pinker, who, in  writes  the following on the question, “Why Are States So Red and Blue?”:
  
But why do ideology and geography cluster so predictably? Why, if you know a person’s position on gay marriage, can you predict that he or she will want to increase the military budget and decrease the tax rate . . . there may also be coherent mindsets beneath the diverse opinions that hang together in right-wing and left-wing belief systems.

<p>Introduction: So  asks  James Ledbetter in Slate.
 
And  the answer is  . . . No!
 
Here’s what happened in 2008:

P.S.  A skeptic might comment that the above graphs, which are based on national poll data, only break down incomes to the top 5% or so.  What about the truly rich.   Here are my thoughts on the political attitudes of the super-rich.  
 
P.P.S.  Ledbetter actually makes some good points in his article, which is about the campaign contributions of rich Americans.  The article relies on a recent book by David Callahan, which seems to echo the work of Tom Ferguson (cited in the above-linked blog entry), who’s tracked campaign contributions by industry over many years.

<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.
 
I would like to echo Cairo’</p><p>2 0.97028893 <a title="50-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-04-Models%2C_assumptions%2C_and_data_summaries.html">1299 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-04-Models, assumptions, and data summaries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw an analysis recently that I didn’t like.  I won’t go into the details, but basically it was a dose-response inference, where a continuous exposure was binned into three broad categories (terciles of the data) and the probability of an adverse event was computed for each tercile.  The effect and the sample size was large enough that the terciles were statistically-significantly different from each other in probability of adverse event, with the probabilities increasing from low to mid to high exposure, as one would predict.
 
I didn’t like this analysis because it is equivalent to fitting a step function.  There is a tendency for people to interpret the (arbitrary) tercile boundaries as being meaningful thresholds even though the underlying dose-response relation has to be continuous.  I’d prefer to start with a linear model and then add nonlinearity from there with a spline or whatever.
 
At this point I stepped back and thought:  Hey, the divide-into-three analysis does not lite</p><p>3 0.96680355 <a title="50-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-30-Why_it%E2%80%99s_so_relaxing_to_think_about_social_issues.html">688 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-30-Why it’s so relaxing to think about social issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was invited by the Columbia University residence halls to speak at an event on gay marriage.  (I’ve assisted my colleagues Jeff Lax and Justin Phillips in their research on the topic.)  The event sounded fun–unfortunately I’ll be out of town that weekend so can’t make it–but it got me thinking about how gay marriage and other social issues are so relaxing to think about because there’s no need for doubt.
 
About half of Americans support same-sex marriage and about half oppose it.  And the funny thing is, you can be absolutely certain in your conviction, from either direction.  If you support, it’s a simple matter of human rights, and it’s a bit ridiculous to suppose that if gay marriage is allowed, it will somehow wreck all the straight marriages out there.  Conversely, you can oppose on the clear rationale of wanting to keep marriage the same as it’s always been, and suggest that same-sex couples can be free to get together outside of marriage, as they always could.

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>5 0.96321952 <a title="50-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-10-R_vs._Stata%2C_or%2C_Different_ways_to_estimate_multilevel_models.html">269 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-10-R vs. Stata, or, Different ways to estimate multilevel models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cyrus writes:
  
I [Cyrus] was teaching a class on multilevel modeling, and we were playing around with different method to fit a random effects logit model with 2 random intercepts—one corresponding to “family” and another corresponding to “community” (labeled “mom” and “cluster” in the data, respectively).  There are also a few regressors at the individual, family, and community level.  We were replicating in part some of the results from the  following paper :  Improved estimation procedures for multilevel models with binary response: a case-study, by G Rodriguez, N Goldman.


(I say “replicating in part” because we didn’t include all the regressors that they use, only a subset.)  We were looking at the performance of estimation via glmer in R’s lme4 package, glmmPQL in R’s MASS package, and Stata’s xtmelogit.  We wanted to study the performance of various estimation methods, including adaptive quadrature methods and penalized quasi-likelihood.

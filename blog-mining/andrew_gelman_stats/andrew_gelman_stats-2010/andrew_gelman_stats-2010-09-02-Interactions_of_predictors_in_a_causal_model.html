There has been some discussion about the recent PISA results (in which the U.S. comes out pretty badly), for example  here  and  here .  The claim being made is that the poor U.S. scores are due to rampant individual- or family-level poverty in the U.S.  They claim that when one controls for poverty, the U.S. comes out on top in the PISA standings, and then they infer that poverty causes poor test scores.  The further inference is then that the U.S. could improve education by the “simple” action of reducing poverty.  Anyway, I was wondering what you thought about their analysis.
  
My reply:  I agree this is interesting and I agree it’s hard to know exactly what to say about these comparisons.  When I’m stuck in this sort of question, I ask, WWJD?  In this case, I think Jennifer would ask what are the potential interventions being considered.

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights.

I am scientist needing to model a treatment effect on a population of ~500 people.  The dependent variable in the model is the difference in a person’s pre-treatment 12 month total medical cost versus post-treatment cost.  So there is large variation in costs, but not so much by using the difference between the pre and post treatment costs.  The issue I’d like some advice on is that the treatment has already occurred so there is no possibility of creating a fully randomized control now.  I do have a very large population of people to use as possible controls via propensity scoring or exact matching.  


If I had a few thousand people to possibly match, then I would use standard techniques.  However, I have a potential population of over a hundred thousand people.  An exact match of the possible controls to age, gender and region of the country still leaves a population of 10,000 controls.

Any chance you could do a post explaining Popper’s propensity theory of probability?  I have never understood it.
  
My reply:  I’m a big fan of Popper (search this blog for details), especially as interpreted by Lakatos, but as far as I can tell, Popper’s theory of probability is hopeless.  We’ve made a lot of progress on probability in the past 75 years, and I don’t see any real need to go back to the bad old days.</p><p>6 0.12349721 <a title="251-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-03-A_psychology_researcher_asks%3A__Is_Anova_dead%3F.html">888 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-03-A psychology researcher asks:  Is Anova dead?</a></p>

I [Behlendorf] am replicating some previous research using OLS [he's talking about what we call "linear regression"---ed.] to regress a logged rate (to reduce skew) of Y on a number of predictors (Xs).  Y is the count of a phenomena divided by the population of the unit of the analysis.  The problem that I am encountering is that Y is composite count of a number of distinct phenomena [A+B+C], and these phenomena are not uniformly distributed across the sample.   Most of the research in this area has conducted regressions either with Y or with individual phenomena [A or B or C] as the dependent variable.  Yet it seems that if [A, B, C] are not uniformly distributed across the sample of units in the same proportion, then the use of Y would be biased, since as a count of [A+B+C] divided by the population, it would treat as equivalent units both [2+0.5+1.5] and [4+0+0].

I’m a physicist by training who is transitioning to the social sciences. I recently came across a  reference  in the Economist to a paper on IQ and parasites which I read as I have more than a passing interest in IQ research (having read much that you and others (e.g., Shalizi, Wicherts) have written). In this paper I note that the authors find a very high correlation between national IQ and parasite prevalence. The strength of the correlation (-0.76 to -0.82) surprised me, as I’m used to much weaker correlations in the social sciences. To me, it’s a bit too high, suggesting that there are other factors at play or that one of the variables is merely a proxy for a large number of other variables. But I have no basis for this other than a gut feeling and a memory of a plot on  Language Log  about the distribution of correlation coefficients in social psychology.


So my question is this: Is a correlation in the range of (-0.82,-0.76) more likely to be a correlatio</p><p>5 0.77297354 <a title="251-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-18-Check_your_missing-data_imputations_using_cross-validation.html">1218 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-18-Check your missing-data imputations using cross-validation</a></p>

I am currently using the iterative regression imputation model as implemented in the Stata ICE package. I am using data from a survey of about 90,000 students in 142 schools and my variable of interest is parent level of education. I want only this variable to be imputed with as little bias as possible as I am not using any other variable. So I scoured the survey for every variable I thought could possibly predict parent education. The main variable I found is parent occupation, which explains about 35% of the variance in parent education for the students with complete data on both. I then include the 20 other variables I found in the survey in a regression predicting parent education, which explains about 40% of the variance in parent education for students with complete data on all the variables.

I am working with clinicians in infectious disease and international health to study the (possible causal) relation between malnutrition and virus infection episodes (e.g., diarrhea) in babies in developing countries.


Basically the clinicians are interested in two questions: does malnutrition cause more diarrhea episodes? does diarrhea lead to malnutrition? The malnutrition status is indicated by height and weight (adjusted, HAZ and WAZ measures) observed every 3 months from birth to 1 year. They also recorded the time of each diarrhea episode during the 1 year follow-up period. They have very solid datasets for analysis.


As you can see, this is almost like a chicken and egg problem. I am a layman to causal inference. The method I use is just to do some simple regression. For example, to study the causal relation from malnutrition to diarrhea episodes, I use binary variable (diarrhea yes/no during months 0-3) as response, and use the HAZ at month 0 as covariate</p><p>2 0.96889359 <a title="251-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-20-Cars_vs._trucks.html">527 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-20-Cars vs. trucks</a></p>

I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Illinois. . . . My main work is in supply chain area, and empirical in nature. . . . I am working with a firm that has two separate divisions – one making cars, and the other makes trucks. Four years back, the firm made an interesting organizational change. They created a separate group of ~25 engineers, in their car division (from within their quality and production engineers). This group was focused on improving supplier quality and reported to car plant head . The truck division did not (and still does not) have such an independent “supplier improvement group”. Other than this unit in car, the organizational arrangements in the two divisions mimic each other.  There are many common suppliers to the car and truck division.


Data on quality of components coming from suppliers has been collected (for the last four years). The organizational change happened in January 2007.

I also felt nostalgia for that relatively nonviolent era.  All those hostages and nobody was killed.  It’s a good thing the Ayatollah didn’t have some fundamentalist Shiite equivalent of John Yoo telling him to waterboard everybody.
 
At the time we were all so angry and upset about the hostage-taking, but from the perspective of our suicide-bomber era, that whole hostage episode seems so comfortingly mild.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.96832985 <a title="251-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-Interactions_of_predictors_in_a_causal_model.html">251 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-Interactions of predictors in a causal model</a></p>

What is the best way to examine interactions of independent variables in a propensity weights framework?  Let’s say we are interested in estimating breathing difficulty (measured on a continuous scale) and our main predictor is age of housing.  The object is to estimate whether living in housing 20 years or older is associated with breathing difficulty compared counterfactually to those living in housing less than 20 years old; as a secondary question, we want to know whether that effect differs for those in poverty compared to those not in poverty.  In our first-stage propensity model, we include whether the respondent lives in poverty.  The weights applied to the other covariates in the propensity model are similar to those living in poverty compared to those who are not.  Now, can I simply interact the poverty variable with the age of construction variable to look at the interaction of age of housing and poverty on breathing difficulty?  My thought is no —</p><p>5 0.94823796 <a title="251-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-04-%E2%80%9CSocial_Psychologists_Detect_Liberal_Bias_Within%E2%80%9D.html">600 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-04-“Social Psychologists Detect Liberal Bias Within”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko asks what I think of  this  news article by John Tierney.  The article’s webpage is given the strange incomplete title above.
 
My first comment is that the headline appears false.  I didn’t see any evidence presented of liberal bias. (If the headline says “Social psychologists detect,” I expect to see some detection, not just anecdotes.) What I did see was a discussion of the fact that most academic psychologists consider themselves politically liberal (a pattern that holds for academic researchers in general), along with some anecdotes of moderates over the years who have felt their political views disrespected by the liberal majority.
  

 
I’m interested in the topic, and I’m open to the possibility that there are all sorts of biases in academic research–but I don’t see the evidence from this article that social psychologists have detected any bias yet.  Phrases such as “a statistically impossible lack of diversity” are just silly.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  blogged  on John Gottman, a psychologist whose headline-grabbing research on marriages (he got himself featured in Blink with a claim that he could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced—after meeting with them for 15 minutes!) was recently debunked in a book by Laurie Abraham.

<p>Introduction: The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society publishes papers followed by discussions.  Lots of discussions, each can be no more than 400 words.  Here’s my most recent discussion:
  
The authors are working on an important applied problem and I have no reason to doubt that their approach is a step forward beyond diagnostic criteria based on point estimation.  An attempt at an accurate assessment of variation is important not just for statistical reasons but also because scientists have the duty to convey their uncertainty to the larger world.  I am thinking, for example, of discredited claims such as that of the mathematician who claimed to predict divorces with 93% accuracy (Abraham, 2010).


Regarding the paper at hand, I thought I would try an experiment in comment-writing.  My usual practice is to read the graphs and then go back and clarify any questions through the text.

 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years. We found no correlation between spouses’ automatic and conscious attitu</p><p>6 0.097172223 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-23-When_are_complicated_models_helpful_in_psychology_research_and_when_are_they_overkill%3F.html">1690 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-23-When are complicated models helpful in psychology research and when are they overkill?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The recent discussion of pollsters reminded me of  a story  from a couple years ago that perhaps is still relevant . . .
 
I was looking up the governors’ popularity numbers on the web, and came across  this page from Rasmussen Reports  which shows Sarah Palin as the 3rd-most-popular governor. But then I looked more carefully. Janet Napolitano of Arizona was viewed as Excellent by 28% of respondents, Good by 27%, Fair by 26%, and Poor by 27%. That adds up to 108%! What’s going on?
 
I’d think they would have a computer program to pipe the survey results directly into the spreadsheet. But I guess not, someone must be typing in these numbers one at a time.  Another possibility is that they are altering their numbers by hand, and someone made a mistake with the Napolitano numbers, adding a few percent in one place and forgetting to subtract elsewhere.  Or maybe there’s another explanation?

<p>Introduction: David Hogg sends in this  bizarre bit  of news reporting by Robert Evans:
  
Until now, in the four decades since it was first posited, no one has convincingly claimed to have glimpsed the Higgs Boson, let alone proved that it actually exists.


At an eagerly awaited briefing on Tuesday at the CERN research centre near Geneva, two independent teams of “Higgs Hunters” – a term they themselves hate – were widely expected to suggest they were fairly confident they had spotted it.


But not confident enough, in the physics world of ultra-precision where certainty has to be measured at nothing less than 100 percent, to announce “a discovery.”


In the jargon, this level is described as 5 sigma . . .
  
So far, so good.  But then comes this doozy:
  
As one scientist explained, that level of accuracy would equate to the 17th-century discoverer of gravity, Isaac Newton, sitting under his apple tree and a million apples one after another falling on his head without one missing.

The recent events in Egypt raise an interesting statistical question.   It is of course common for news stations like CNN to interview various officials and policy experts to find out what is likely to happen next. The obvious response of people like us is why ask such people when they didn’t foresee a month ago that these dynamic events were about to happen.  One would instead like to hear from those experts that did predict that something was about to happen in Tunisia, and Egypt, and Jordan, and maybe Yemen, etc.  Well, are there such people?  My friend Bob Burton says that of course one can find such people in the sense that they made such predictions, but that is like finding counties that have voted for the President in the last five elections, big deal, or psychics that predicted the last assassination, again big deal.  There is a good deal of truth in that.  However, it seems like we do a little better.  There are two points to make.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>2 0.94968027 <a title="69-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-09-I_was_at_a_meeting_a_couple_months_ago_._._..html">999 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-09-I was at a meeting a couple months ago . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ring Lardner, Jr.:
  
[In 1936] I was already settled in Southern California, and it may have been that first exercise of the franchise that triggered the FBI surveillance of me that would last for decades.  I had assumed, of course, that I was enjoying the vaunted American privilege of the secret ballot.  On a wall outside my polling place on Wilshire Boulevard, however, was a compilation of the district’s registered voters:  Democrats, a long list of names; Republicans, a somewhat lesser number; and “Declines to State,” one, “Ring W. Lardner, Jr.”  The day after the election, alongside those lists were published the results:  Roosevelt, so many; Landon, so many; Browder, one.</p><p>4 0.91457361 <a title="69-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-17-More_on_the_difficulty_of_%E2%80%9Cpreaching_what_you_practice%E2%80%9D.html">1325 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-17-More on the difficulty of “preaching what you practice”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>same-blog 5 0.91366208 <a title="69-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-04-A_Wikipedia_whitewash.html">69 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-04-A Wikipedia whitewash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After hearing a few times about the divorce predictions of researchers John Gottman and James Murray (work that was featured in Blink with a claim that they could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced–after meeting with them for 15 minutes) and  feeling some skepticism , I decided to do the Lord’s work and amend Gottman’s wikipedia entry, which had a paragraph saying:
  
Gottman found his methodology predicts with 90% accuracy which newlywed couples will remain married and which will divorce four to six years later. It is also 81% percent accurate in predicting which marriages will survive after seven to nine years.
  
I added the following:
  
Gottman’s claim of 81% or 90% accuracy is misleading, however, because the accuracy is measured only  after  fitting a model to his data. There is no evidence that he can predict the outcome of a marriage with high accuracy in advance.

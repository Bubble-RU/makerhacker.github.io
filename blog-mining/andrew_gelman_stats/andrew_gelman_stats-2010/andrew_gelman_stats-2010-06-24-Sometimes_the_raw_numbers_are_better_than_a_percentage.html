<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.

<p>Introduction: We had a  discussion  the other day of a paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change,” by economist Richard Tol.
 
The paper came to my attention after I saw a  notice  from Adam Marcus that it was recently revised because of data errors.  But after looking at the paper more carefully, I see a bunch of other problems that, to me, make the whole analysis close to useless as it stands.
 
I think this is worth discussing because the paper has been somewhat influential (so far cited 328 times, according to Google Scholar) and has even been cited in the  popular press  as evidence that “Climate change has done more good than harm so far and is likely to continue doing so for most of this century . . . There are many likely effects of climate change: positive and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial. And if you aggregate them all, the overall effect is positive today — and likely to stay positive until around 2080. That was the conclusion of Professor Richard Tol</p><p>4 0.12648273 <a title="108-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.12524617 <a title="108-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-26-Musical_chairs_in_econ_journals.html">371 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-26-Musical chairs in econ journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>6 0.12416469 <a title="108-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-07-Inference_%3D_data_%2B_model.html">1201 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-07-Inference = data + model</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya. We think it’s a remarkable mode</p><p>4 0.69610596 <a title="108-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-10-Psychiatric_drugs_and_the_reduction_in_crime.html">333 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-10-Psychiatric drugs and the reduction in crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.

Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.


Chris Sheehan just sent me  this NYT article on air conditioning , where they mention this neat natural experiment:

Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.

At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest.

The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)

I was wondering if multilevel models can be used as an alternative to 2SLS or IV models to deal with (i) endogeneity and (ii) selection problems.


More concretely, I am trying to assess the impact of investment treaties on foreign investment. Aside from the fact that foreign investment is correlated over time, it may be the case that countries that already receive sufficient amounts of foreign investment need not sign treaties, and countries that sign treaties are those that need foreign investment in the first place. Countries thus “select” into treatment; treaty signing is non-random. As such, I argue that to properly estimate the impact of treaties on investment, we must model the determinants of treaty signing.


I [Teo] am currently modeling this as two separate models: (1) regress predictors on likelihood of treaty signing, (2) regress treaty (with interactions, etc) on investment (I’ve thought of using propensity score matching for this part of the model)</p><p>5 0.96903467 <a title="108-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Detecting_predictability_in_complex_ecosystems.html">1802 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Detecting predictability in complex ecosystems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  a recent article , “Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems,” by fisheries researchers George Sugihara, Robert May, Hao Ye, Chih-hao Hsieh, Ethan Deyle, Michael Fogarty, and Stephan Munch.
 
I don’t know anything about ecology research but I could imagine this method being useful in that field.  I can’t see the approach doing much in political science, where I think their stated goal of “identifying causal networks” is typically irrelevant.
 
That said, if you replace the word “causality” by “predictability” everywhere in the paper, it starts to make a lot more sense.  As they write, they are working within “a framework that uses predictability as opposed to correlation to identify causation between time-series variables.”  Setting causation aside, predictability is an important topic in itself.  The search for patterns of predictability in complex structures may motivate causal hypotheses that can be studied more directly, using more traditional statis</p><p>6 0.96611333 <a title="108-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-25-Life_as_a_blogger%3A__the_emails_just_get_weirder_and_weirder.html">1589 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-25-Life as a blogger:  the emails just get weirder and weirder</a></p>

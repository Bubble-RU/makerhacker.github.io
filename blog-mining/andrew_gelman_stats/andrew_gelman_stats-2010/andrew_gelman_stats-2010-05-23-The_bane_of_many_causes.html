<p>Introduction: In response to the post  The bane of many causes  in the context of mobile phone use and brain cancer,  Robert Erikson  wrote:
  

The true control here is the side of the head of the tumor: same side as phone use or opposite side.   If that is the test, the data from the study are scary.  Clearly tumors are more likely on the “same” side, at whatever astronomical p value you want to use.   That cannot be explained away by misremembering, since an auxiliary study showed misremembering was not biased toward cell phone-tumor consistency.

  
A strong signal in the data pointed by Prof. Erikson is that the tumors are overwhelmingly likelier to appear on the same side of the head as where the phone is held. I’ve converted the ratios into percentages, based on an assumption that the risk for tumors would be apriori equal for both sides of the head.

<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>4 0.73957938 <a title="48-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Massive_confusion_about_a_study_that_purports_to_show_that_exercise_may_increase_heart_risk.html">1364 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Massive confusion about a study that purports to show that exercise may increase heart risk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>6 0.72818118 <a title="48-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-16-%E2%80%9CNightshifts_Linked_to_Increased_Risk_for_Ovarian_Cancer%E2%80%9D.html">1766 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-16-“Nightshifts Linked to Increased Risk for Ovarian Cancer”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the newsflies buzzing around today is an  article   “Brain tumour risk in relation to mobile telephone use: results of the INTERPHONE international case-control study” .
 
The results, shown in this pretty table below, appear to be inconclusive.
 
   
 
A limited amount of cellphone radiation is good for your brain, but not too much? It’s unfortunate that the extremes are truncated. The commentary at  Microwave News  blames bias:
  

The problem with selection bias –also called participation bias– became apparent after the brain tumor risks observed throughout the study were so low as to defy reason. If they reflect reality, they would indicate that cell phones confer immediate protection against tumors. All sides agree that this is extremely unlikely. Further analysis pointed to unanticipated differences between the cases (those with brain tumors) and the controls (the reference group).


The second problem concerns how accurately study participants could recall the amount of t</p><p>2 0.95335573 <a title="48-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-14-Controversy_about_a_ranking_of_philosophy_departments%2C_or_How_should_we_think_about_statistical_results_when_we_can%E2%80%99t_see_the_raw_data%3F.html">1212 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-14-Controversy about a ranking of philosophy departments, or How should we think about statistical results when we can’t see the raw data?</a></p>

A friend of mine and I  cited  your  open data article  in our attempts to persuade a professor at another institution [Brian Leiter] into releasing the raw data from his influential rankings of philosophy departments. He is now claiming the national security response:

 
. . . disclosing the reputational data would violate the terms on  which the evaluators agreed to complete the surveys (did they even bother to read the description of the methodology, one wonders?).
 

I [Helzner] do not find this to be a compelling reply in this case. In fact, I  would say that when such data cannot be disclosed it reveals a flaw in the design of the survey. Experimental designs must be open so  that others can run the experiment. Mathematical proofs must be open so that they can be reviewed by others. Likewise, it seems to me that the details of statistical argument should be open to inspection. Do you have any thoughts on this?

I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Illinois. . . . My main work is in supply chain area, and empirical in nature. . . . I am working with a firm that has two separate divisions – one making cars, and the other makes trucks. Four years back, the firm made an interesting organizational change. They created a separate group of ~25 engineers, in their car division (from within their quality and production engineers). This group was focused on improving supplier quality and reported to car plant head . The truck division did not (and still does not) have such an independent “supplier improvement group”. Other than this unit in car, the organizational arrangements in the two divisions mimic each other.  There are many common suppliers to the car and truck division.


Data on quality of components coming from suppliers has been collected (for the last four years). The organizational change happened in January 2007.

As I get interested in Bayesian approaches to statistics, I have one question I wondered if you would find interesting to address at some point on the blog.


What does Bayesian work look like in action across a field? From experience, I have some feeling for how ongoing debates evolve (or not) with subsequent studies in response to earlier findings. I wonder if you know how this happens in practice when multiple researchers are using Bayesian approaches. How much are previous findings built into priors? How much advance comes from model improvement? And in a social science field where self-selection and self-interest play a role, how are improved “treatment” effects incorporated and evaluated?


I thought you might know of a field where actual back and forth has been carried out mostly in the context of Bayesian analysis or inference, and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at an example as I think about my own field.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko asks what I think of  this  news article by John Tierney.  The article’s webpage is given the strange incomplete title above.
 
My first comment is that the headline appears false.  I didn’t see any evidence presented of liberal bias. (If the headline says “Social psychologists detect,” I expect to see some detection, not just anecdotes.) What I did see was a discussion of the fact that most academic psychologists consider themselves politically liberal (a pattern that holds for academic researchers in general), along with some anecdotes of moderates over the years who have felt their political views disrespected by the liberal majority.
  

 
I’m interested in the topic, and I’m open to the possibility that there are all sorts of biases in academic research–but I don’t see the evidence from this article that social psychologists have detected any bias yet.  Phrases such as “a statistically impossible lack of diversity” are just silly.

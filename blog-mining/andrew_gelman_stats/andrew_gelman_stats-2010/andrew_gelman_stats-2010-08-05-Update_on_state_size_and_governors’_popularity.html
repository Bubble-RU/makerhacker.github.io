And here’s what Obradovich wrote:
  
It seems that average unemployment rate is more strongly negatively correlated with positive governor approval ratings than is population.  The unemployment rate and state size is positively correlated.


Anyway, when I include state unemployment rate in the regressions, it pulls the significance away from state population.  I do economic data work much of the day, so when I read your post this morning and looked at your charts, state unemployment rates jumped right out at me as a potential confound.
  
I passed this suggestion on to Hanfei, who ran some regressions:

<p>Introduction: Stephen Ansolabehere, Marc Meredith, and Erik Snowberg  write :
  
The literature on economic voting notes that voters’ subjective evaluations of the overall state of the economy are correlated with vote choice, whereas personal economic experiences are not. Missing from this literature is a description of how voters acquire information about the general state of the economy, and how that information is used to form perceptions. In order to begin understanding this process, we [Ansolabehere, Meredith, and Snowberg] asked a series of questions on the 2006 ANES Pilot about respondents’ perceptions of the average price of gas and the unemployment rate in their home state.


We find that questions about gas prices and unemployment show differences in the sources of information about these two economic variables. Information about unemployment rates come from media sources, and are systematically biased by partisan factors. Information about gas prices, in contrast, comes only from everyday</p><p>4 0.14096665 <a title="187-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-16-Learning_about_correlations_using_cross-sectional_and_over-time_comparisons_between_and_within_countries.html">1985 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-16-Learning about correlations using cross-sectional and over-time comparisons between and within countries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Antonio Rinaldi writes:
  
Here in Italy an “hype” topic is the “staffetta tra generazioni”, handover between generations: since unemployment rate in young people is very high, someone in the government is thinking to encourage older people to anticipate their retirement to make more jobs available for youngs. 
I am not an economist and I don’t want to discuss the economic plausibility of such a possible measure. 
However, some economists deny its success simply on the basis of a correlation and regression analysis. You can see the charts used as “evidence” here: http://www.lavoce.info/per-una-vera-staffetta-generazionale/ and here: http://noisefromamerika.org/articolo/occupazione-ricambio-intergenerazionale. 
The first chart shows that there is no correlation between activity rate in older people and unemployment rate in younger people.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: After I posted  this  recent comment on a blog of Steven Pinker (see also  here ), we had the following exchange.  I’m reposting it here (with Pinker’s agreement) not because we achieved any deep insights but because I thought it useful to reveal to people that so-called experts such as us are not so clear on these issues either. 
   
 AG:   I noticed your article on red and blue states and had some thoughts. . . . The short summary is that I think that your idea is interesting but that, as stated, it explains too much, in that your story is based on centuries-long history but it only fits electoral patterns since the 1980s.
 
 SP:   Though the exact alignment between red and blue states, political parties, and particular issues surely shift, I’d be surprised if the basic alignments between geography and the right-left divide, and the issues that cluster on each side of the divide, have radically changed over the past century.

<p>Introduction: After noting the increasing political conservatism of people in the poorer states, Richard Florida  writes :
  
The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism’s hold on America’s states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal.


Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward.


But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political.

<p>Introduction: Nick Obradovich saw  our graphs and regressions  showing that the most popular governors tended to come from small states and suggested looking at unemployment rates.  (I’d used change in per-capita income as my economic predictor, following the usual practice in political science.)
 
Here’s the graph that got things started:
 
   
 
And here’s what Obradovich wrote:
  
It seems that average unemployment rate is more strongly negatively correlated with positive governor approval ratings than is population.  The unemployment rate and state size is positively correlated.


Anyway, when I include state unemployment rate in the regressions, it pulls the significance away from state population.  I do economic data work much of the day, so when I read your post this morning and looked at your charts, state unemployment rates jumped right out at me as a potential confound.
  
I passed this suggestion on to Hanfei, who ran some regressions:

<p>Introduction: After I gave  my talk  at an econ seminar on Why We (Usually) Don’t Care About Multiple Comparisons, I got the following comment:
  
One question that came up later was whether your argument is really with testing in general, rather than only with testing in multiple comparison settings.
  
My reply:
 
Yes, my argument is with testing in general.  But it arises with particular force in multiple comparisons.  With a single test, we can just say we dislike testing so we use confidence intervals or Bayesian inference instead, and it’s no problem—really more of a change in emphasis than a change in methods.  But with multiple tests, the classical advice is not simply to look at type 1 error rates but more specifically to make a multiplicity adjustment, for example to make confidence intervals wider to account for multiplicity.  I don’t want to do this!  So here there is a real battle to fight.

<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine. The Holiday Inn testing facility was the largest in North America, and had been operating for nearly ten years before inspecto</p><p>5 0.94842345 <a title="187-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-19-Validation_of_Software_for_Bayesian_Models_Using_Posterior_Quantiles.html">1019 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-19-Validation of Software for Bayesian Models Using Posterior Quantiles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love  this stuff :
  
This article presents a simulation-based method designed to establish the computational correctness of software developed to fit a specific Bayesian model, capitalizing on properties of Bayesian posterior distributions. We illustrate the validation technique with two examples. The validation method is shown to find errors in software when they exist and, moreover, the validation output can be informative about the nature and location of such errors. We also compare our method with that of an earlier approach.

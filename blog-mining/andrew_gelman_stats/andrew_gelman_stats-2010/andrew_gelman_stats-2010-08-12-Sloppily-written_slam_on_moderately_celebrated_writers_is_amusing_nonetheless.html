Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.

<p>Introduction: J. Robert Lennon  writes :
  
At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest. 
  
This naturally got me thinking about statisticians.  Some statisticians are famous (within</p><p>3 0.10133684 <a title="204-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-01-Literature_and_life.html">174 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-01-Literature and life</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What can we learn about an author from his or her fiction?  This is an old, old question, I know.  But I still can’t help thinking about it when I read a book.
 
 John Updike ‘s stories are full of male characters whom women find irresistibly attractive.  I can only assume that this reflects Updike’s own experiences, to some extent.  If he had not been, in reality, catnip to women, I imagine he’d have made more of a big deal about the episodes in his books where women kept falling into his protagonists’ laps.
 
Same for  John D. Macdonald , although there I suppose it’s possible he was just throwing in the sex to sell books.
 
And even more so for  Richard Ford .  This guy’s male characters are so smooth, there’s no way that Ford isn’t/wasn’t like that too.
 
What about Lorrie Moore?  I think she must have had a very frustrating life (so far).  I say this because her stories always seem to be centered around a female character who is witty, thoughtful, and refined, and surrounded by re</p><p>4 0.084991537 <a title="204-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-18-Not_as_ugly_as_you_look.html">1174 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-18-Not as ugly as you look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Surfing the  blogroll , I found myself on Helen DeWitt’s  page  and noticed the link to the Joshua Clover, alias Jane Dark.  I hadn’t checked out Clover for awhile (see my reactions  here  and  here ), so I decided to head on over.
 
Here’s what it looked like:
 
   
 
“The case against the Federal minimum wage,” huh?  That surprised me, as I had the vague impression that Clover was on the far left of the American political spectrum.  But I guess he could have some sort of wonky thing going on, or maybe there’s some unexpected twist?  It seemed a bit off of Clover’s usual cultural-criticism beat, so I clicked through to take a look . . . and it was just a boring set of paragraphs on the minimum wage.
 
Hmmmm.  I went back to the homepage, looked around more carefully, and realized that the blog is fake, the online equivalent of those fake book spines that are used to simulate rows of books on a bookshelf.
 
I don’t know what happened.  My guess is that Clover got tired of blogging and</p><p>3 0.80295074 <a title="204-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-26-Tough_love_as_a_style_of_writing.html">111 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-26-Tough love as a style of writing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to an interview with Seth Godin, who makes some commonplace but useful observations on jobs and careers.  It’s fine, but whenever I read this sort of thing, I get annoyed by the super-aggressive writing style.  These internet guys–Seth Godin, Clay Shirky, Philip Greenspun, Jeff Jarvis, and so on–are always getting in your face, telling you how everything you thought was true was wrong.  Some of the things these guys say are just silly (for example, Godin’s  implication  that Bob Dylan is more of a success than the Monkees because Dylan sells more tickets), other times they have interesting insights, but reading any of them for awhile just sets me on edge.  I can’t take being shouted at, and I get a little tired of hearing over and over again that various people, industries, etc., are dinosaurs.
 
Where does this aggressive style come from?  My guess is that it’s coming from the vast supply of “business books” out there.  These are books that are supposed to grab yo</p><p>4 0.79424447 <a title="204-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-02-The_new_Helen_DeWitt_novel.html">886 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-02-The new Helen DeWitt novel</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read the excerpt in n+1.  As one would expect of DeWitt, it was great, while being nothing at all like her  other  book.  THe new book reminded me a bit of Philip K. Dick.  Here’s a brief excerpt (which is not actually particularly PKD-like) of the main character talking to himself:
  
“I don’t have what it takes,” he said.  He had never said it before because saying it would be like admitting he couldn’t make the grade.
  
I’m not pulling out this quote to sell you on the book.  The lines just struck me because of the exquisite distinctions, the idea that “don’t have what it takes” is somehow different than “couldn’t make the grade,” the idea that this character, who expresses his thoughts in empty phrases, ends up assigning to these phrases a set of precise meanings that make sense only to him.

 BPS Research Digest :  I haven’t been following this one recently, but it has lots of good links, I should probably check it more often.  There are a couple things that bother me, though.  The blog is sponsored by the British Psychological Society, so this sounds pretty serious.  But then they run things like advertising  promotions  sponsored by a textbook company and highlight iffy experimental claims.  For example, in 2010 they ran a wholly uncritical  post  on the notorious Daryl Bem study that purported to find ESP.  After being called on it in the comments, the blogger (Christian Jarrett) responded with, “The stats appear sound. . . . it’s a great study. Rigorously conducted” and even defended “the discussion of quantum physics in the paper.”  To be fair, though, and as he  points out  in comments, Jarrett wrote of Bem’s study:  “this isn’t proof of psi, far fr</p><p>6 0.77918237 <a title="204-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-13-Trips_to_Cleveland.html">30 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-13-Trips to Cleveland</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).


I would love for you (and anyone you’d like to</p><p>2 0.94775039 <a title="204-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Fake_newspaper_headlines.html">188 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Fake newspaper headlines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I used  this convenient site  to create some images for a talk I’m preparing.  (The competing headlines:  “Beautiful parents have more daughters” vs. “No compelling evidence that beautiful parents are more or less likely to have daughters.”  The latter gets cut off at “No compelling evidence that,” which actually works pretty well to demonstrate the sort of dull headline that would result if newspapers were to publish null results.)</p><p>3 0.91106802 <a title="204-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Something on Applied Bayesian Statistics
 
April 27, 4:10-5 p.m., 1011 Evans Hall
 
I will deliver  one  of the following three talks: 
1.  Of beauty, sex, and power: Statistical challenges in estimating small effects  
2.  Why we (usually) don’t worry about multiple comparisons  
3.  Parameterization and Bayesian modeling  
Whoever shows up on time to the seminar gets to vote, and I’ll give the talk that gets the most votes.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89540148 <a title="204-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written_slam_on_moderately_celebrated_writers_is_amusing_nonetheless.html">204 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written slam on moderately celebrated writers is amusing nonetheless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

<p>Introduction: We’re working with polling company YouGov to track public opinion, state-by-state and district-by-district, during the 2014 campaign.  We’ll be using multilevel regression and poststratification, and implementing it in Stan, and developing the necessary new parts of Stan to get this running scalably and efficiently.

- You’ll be in the midst of the most advanced polling team anywhere; 
- You’ll be doing cutting-edge statistical research on MRP with deep interactions; 
- You’ll be doing basic research in statistical computing, developing fast and scalable deterministic and stochastic algorithms for fitting multilevel models; 
- You’ll be working inside Stan, the most advanced general computational framework for Bayesian analysis.

<p>Introduction: David Blei writes:
  
I have  two postdoc openings for basic research in probabilistic modeling .


The thrusts are (a) scalable inference and (b) model checking.  We 
will be developing new methods and implementing them in probabilistic 
programming systems.  I am open to applicants interested in many kinds 
of applications and from any field.
  
“Scalable inference” means black-box VB and related ideas, and “probabilistic programming systems” means Stan!  (You might be familiar with Stan as an implementation of Nuts for posterior sampling, but Stan is also an efficient program for computing probability densities and their gradients, and as such is an ideal platform for developing scalable implementations of variational inference and related algorithms.)
 
And you know I like model checking.

Postdoctoral Researcher (3 years) in State-Space Modeling of Animal Movement and Population Dynamics in Universities of Turku and Helsinki, Finland


We seek for a statistician/mathematician with experience in ecological modeling or an ecologist with strong quantitative training to join an interdisciplinary research team focusing on dispersal and dynamics of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans).


The Postdoctoral Researcher will develop modeling approaches (from individual based models to population level models) to assess the dispersal and population dynamics of the flying squirrel. A key challenge will be the integration of different kinds of data (census data, telemetry data, mark-recapture data, life-history data, and data on environmental covariates such as forest structure) into the modeling framework using Bayesian State-Space models or other such approaches.


The project will be supervised by Dr. Vesa Selonen (a flying squirrel specialist;</p><p>5 0.7820062 <a title="62-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-10-Jobs_in_statistics_research%21__In_New_Jersey%21.html">1110 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-10-Jobs in statistics research!

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: Postdoc #1. Hierarchical Modeling and Computation: We are fitting hierarchical regression models with deep interactions. We’re working on new models with structured prior distributions, and this also requires advances in Bayesian computation. Applications include public opinion, climate reconstruction, and education research.
 
Postdoc #1 is funded by grants from the Department of Energy, Institute of Education Sciences, and National Science Foundation.
 
Postdoc #2. Hierarchical Modeling and Statistical Graphics: The goal of this research program is to investigate the application of the latest methods of multi-level data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem: forecasting retail sales at the individual item level. These forecasts are used to make ordering, pricing and promotions decisions which can have significant economic impact to the retail chain such that even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions, across a large retailer’s</p><p>3 0.9208349 <a title="62-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-Neumann_update.html">432 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-Neumann update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice. The breadth of vN’s work is just too m</p><p>4 0.91766149 <a title="62-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-The_R_code_for_those_time-use_graphs.html">672 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-The R code for those time-use graphs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>6 0.91268295 <a title="62-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>

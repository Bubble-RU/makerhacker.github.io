<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights. I would only add one thing to his formula at the end of his</p><p>3 0.18135644 <a title="107-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-10-Combining_data_from_many_sources.html">948 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-10-Combining data from many sources</a></p>

I’d like to request general feedback and references for a problem of combining disparate data sources in a regression model. We’d like to model log crop yield as a function of environmental predictors, but the observations come from many data sources and are peculiarly structured. Among the issues are:


1. Measurement precision in predictors and outcome varies widely with data sources. Some observations are in very coarse units of measurement, due to rounding or even observer guesswork. 


2. There are obvious clusters of observations arising from studies in which crop yields were monitored over successive years in spatially proximate communities. Thus some variables may be constant within clusters–this is true even for log yield, probably due to rounding of similar yields. 


3. Cluster size and intra-cluster association structure (temporal, spatial or both) vary widely across the dataset.

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.
 
 Solution to question 27

I’m fitting a state-space model right now that estimates the “design effect” of individual pollsters (Ratio of poll variance to that predicted by perfect random sampling). What would be a good prior distribution for that?
  
My quickest suggestion is start with something simple, such as a uniform from 1 to 10, and then to move to something hierarchical, such as a lognormal on (design.effect – 1), with the hyperparameters estimated from data.
 
My longer suggestion is to take things apart.  What exactly do you mean by “design effect”?  There are lots of things going on, both in sampling error (the classical “design effect” that comes from cluster sampling, stratification, weighting, etc.) and nonsampling error (nonresponse bias, likeliy voter screening, bad questions, etc.)  It would be best if you could model both pieces.</p><p>6 0.15521368 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-25-Design_of_nonrandomized_cluster_sample_study.html">820 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-25-Design of nonrandomized cluster sample study</a></p>

When we estimate the number of people from a national sampling survey (such as labor force survey) using sampling weights, don’t we obtain underestimated number of people, if the country’s population is growing and the sampling frame is based on an old census data?  In countries with increasing populations, the probability of inclusion changes over time, but the weights can’t be adjusted frequently because census takes place only once every five or ten years.


I am currently working for UNICEF for a project on estimating number of out-of-school children in developing countries. The project leader is comfortable to use estimates of number of people from DHS and other surveys.  But, I am concerned that we may need to adjust the estimated number of people by the population projection, otherwise the estimates will be underestimated.

I think I am having an existential crisis.


I used to work with animals (rats, mice, gerbils etc.) Then I started to work in marketing research where we did have some kind of random sampling procedure. So up until a few years ago, I was sort of okay.


Now I am teaching marketing research, and I feel like there is no real random sampling anymore. I take pains to get students to understand what random means, and then the whole lot of inferential statistics.  Then almost anything they do – the sample is not random. They think I am contradicting myself.  They use convenience samples at every turn – for their school work, and the enormous amount on online surveying that gets done. Do you have any suggestions for me?

<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design.

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).

I’m working at a non-profit organization called CRRC in the Republic of Georgia.
      
I’m having a methodological problem and I saw the syllabus for your sampling class online and thought I might be able to ask you about it?


We do a lot of complex surveys nationwide; our typical sample design is as follows:


- stratify by rural/urban/capital 
- sub-stratify the rural and urban strata into NE/NW/SE/SW geographic quadrants 
- select voting precincts as PSUs 
- select households as SSUs 
- select individual respondents as TSUs


I’m relatively new here, and past practice has been to sample voting precincts with probability proportional to size.  It’s desirable because it’s not logistically feasible for us to vary the number of interviews per precinct with precinct size, so it makes the selection probabilities for households more even across precinct sizes. However, I have a complex sampling textbook (Lohr 1999), and it explains how complex it is to calculate sel</p><p>2 0.95370281 <a title="107-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-20-Burglars_are_local.html">156 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-20-Burglars are local</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  makes sense:
 
In the land of fiction, it’s the criminal’s modus operandi – his method of entry, his taste for certain jewellery and so forth – that can be used by detectives to identify his handiwork. The reality according to a new analysis of solved burglaries in the Northamptonshire region of England is that these aspects of criminal behaviour are on their own unreliable as identifying markers, most likely because they are dictated by circumstances rather than the criminal’s taste and style. However, the geographical spread and timing of a burglar’s crimes are distinctive, and could help with police investigations.
 
And, as a bonus,  more  Tourette’s pride!

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>4 0.92351937 <a title="107-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-12-Steven_Pinker%E2%80%99s_unconvincing_debunking_of_group_selection.html">1414 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-12-Steven Pinker’s unconvincing debunking of group selection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>5 0.92135072 <a title="107-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-19-The_free_cup_and_the_extra_dollar%3A__A_speculation_in_philosophy.html">668 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-19-The free cup and the extra dollar:  A speculation in philosophy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The following is an essay into a topic I know next to nothing about.
 
As part of our endless discussion of Dilbert and Charlie Sheen, commenter Fraac  linked  to a blog by philosopher Edouard Machery, who tells a  fascinating story :
  
How do we think about the intentional nature of actions? And how do people with an impaired mindreading capacity think about it?


Consider the following probes: 


The Free-Cup Case

 
Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, ‘I don’t care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.’ Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a commemorative cup. Did Joe intentionally obtain the commemorative cup?

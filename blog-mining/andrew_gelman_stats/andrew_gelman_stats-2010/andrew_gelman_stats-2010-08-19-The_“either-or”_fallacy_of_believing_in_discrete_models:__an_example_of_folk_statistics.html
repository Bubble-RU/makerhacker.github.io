<p>Introduction: Astrophysicist Andrew Jaffe pointed me to  this and discussion  of my  philosophy  of statistics (which is, in turn, my rational reconstruction of the statistical practice of Bayesians such as Rubin and Jaynes).  Jaffe’s summary is fair enough and I only disagree in a few points: 
   
1.  Jaffe writes:
  
Subjective probability, at least the way it is actually used by practicing scientists, is a sort of “as-if” subjectivity — how would an agent reason if her beliefs were reflected in a certain set of probability distributions? This is why when I discuss probability I try to make the pedantic point that all probabilities are conditional, at least on some background prior information or context.
  
I agree, and my problem with the usual procedures used for Bayesian model comparison and Bayesian model averaging is not that these approaches are subjective but that the particular models being considered don’t make sense.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10. Inference about μ is straightforward, as is model checking, whether based on graphs or numerical summaries such as the sample variance and skewn</p><p>5 0.15247741 <a title="217-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-27-Bayesian_model_averaging_or_fitting_a_larger_model.html">1999 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-27-Bayesian model averaging or fitting a larger model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Firoozye writes:
  
I had a question about BMA [Bayesian model averaging] and model combinations in general, and direct it to you since they are a basic form of hierarchical model, albeit in the simplest of forms. I wanted to ask what the underlying assumptions are that could lead to BMA improving on a larger model. 


I know model combination is a topic of interest in the (frequentist) econometrics community (e.g., Bates & Granger, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3008764?uid=3738032&uid;=2&uid;=4&sid;=21101948653381) but at the time it was considered a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps small models combined outperform a big model due to standard errors, insufficient data, etc. But I haven’t seen much in way of Bayesian justification.


In simplest terms, you might have a joint density P(Y,theta_1,theta_2) from which you could use the two marginals P(Y,theta_1) and P(Y,theta_2) to derive two separate forecasts. A BMA-er would do a weighted average of the two forecast densities, having p</p><p>6 0.15148017 <a title="217-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-07-When_you%E2%80%99re_planning_on_fitting_a_model%2C_build_up_to_it_by_fitting_simpler_models_first.__Then%2C_once_you_have_a_model_you_like%2C_check_the_hell_out_of_it.html">1972 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-07-When you’re planning on fitting a model, build up to it by fitting simpler models first.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Livengood writes:
  
I have a couple of questions on your paper with Cosma Shalizi on “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics.”


First, you distinguish between inductive approaches and hypothetico-deductive approaches to inference and locate statistical practice (at least, the practice of model building and checking) on the hypothetico-deductive side.  Do you think that there are any interesting elements of statistical practice that are properly inductive?  For example, suppose someone is playing around with a system that more or less resembles a toy model, like drawing balls from an urn or some such, and where the person has some well-defined priors.  The person makes a number of draws from the urn and applies Bayes theorem to get a posterior.  On your view, is that person making an induction?  If so, how much space is there in statistical practice for genuine inductions like this?

<p>Introduction: Warning – this blog post is meant to encourage some loose, fuzzy and possibly distracting thoughts about the practice of statistics in research endeavours. There maybe spelling and grammatical errors as well as a lack of proper sentence structure. It may not be understandable to many or even possibly any readers. 
 
But somewhat more seriously, its better that “ConUnMax”
 
So far I have five maxims
 
1. Explicit models of uncertanty are useful but – always wrong and can always be made less wrong 
2. If the model is formally a probability model –  always use probability calculus (Bayes) 
3. Always useful to make the model a formal probability model – no matter what (Bayesianisn)

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo quotes me as saying, “Popper has argued (convincingly, in my opinion) that scientific inference is not inductive but deductive.”  She then  follows up  with:
  
Gelman employs significance test-type reasoning to reject a model when the data sufficiently disagree.


Now, strictly speaking, a model falsification, even to inferring something as weak as “the model breaks down,” is not purely deductive, but Gelman is right to see it as about as close as one can get, in statistics, to a deductive falsification of a model. But where does that leave him as a Jaynesian?
  
My reply:
 
I was influenced by reading a toy example from Jaynes’s book where he sets up a model (for the probability of a die landing on each of its six sides) based on first principles, then presents some data that contradict the model, then expands the model.
 
I’d seen very little of this sort of this reasoning before in statistics!  In physics it’s the standard way to go:  you set up a model based on physic</p><p>6 0.82627839 <a title="217-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-21-More_on_Bayesian_model_selection_in_high-dimensional_settings.html">1817 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-21-More on Bayesian model selection in high-dimensional settings</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From a commenter on the web, 21 May 2010:
  
Tampa Bay:  Playing .732 ball in the toughest division in baseball, wiped their feet on NY twice.  If they sweep Houston, which seems pretty likely, they will be at .750, which I [the commenter] have never heard of. 
  
At the time of that posting, the Rays were 30-11.  Quick calculation:  if a team is good enough to be expected to win 100 games, that is, Pr(win) = 100/162 = .617, then there’s a 5% chance that they’ll have won at least 30 of their first 41 games.  That’s a calculation based on simple probability theory of independent events, which isn’t quite right here but will get you close and is a good way to  train one’s intuition , I think.
 
Having a .732 record after 41 games is not unheard-of.  The Detroit Tigers won 35 of their first 40 games in 1984:  that’s .875.  (I happen to remember that fast start, having been an Orioles fan at the time.)

<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>same-blog 3 0.9388091 <a title="217-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-19-The_%E2%80%9Ceither-or%E2%80%9D_fallacy_of_believing_in_discrete_models%3A__an_example_of_folk_statistics.html">217 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-19-The “either-or” fallacy of believing in discrete models:  an example of folk statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Psychologists talk about “folk psychology”:  ideas that make sense to us about how people think and behave, even if these ideas are not accurate descriptions of reality.  And physicists talk about “folk physics” (for example, the idea that a thrown ball falls in a straight line and then suddenly drops, rather than following an approximate parabola).
 
There’s also “folk statistics.”  Some of the ideas of folk statistics are so strong that even educated people–even well-known researchers–can make these mistakes.
 
One of the ideas of folk statistics that bothers me a lot is what might be called the “either/or fallacy”:  the idea that if there are two possible stories, the truth has to be one or the other.
 
I have often encountered the either/or fallacy in Bayesian statistics, for example the vast literature on “model selection” or “variable selection” or “model averaging” in which it is assumed that one of some pre-specified discrete set of models is the truth, and that this true model</p><p>4 0.93731934 <a title="217-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-25-See_me_talk_in_the_Upper_West_Side_%28without_graphs%29_today.html">821 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-25-See me talk in the Upper West Side (without graphs) today</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At Picnic Cafe, Broadway at 101 St, 6-7pm today.
  
Should we vote even though it probably won’t make a difference? Why is the question “Are we better off now than four years ago?” not an appeal to selfishness? Are Americans as polarized as we think? Come explore these and other questions about voting in America today.
  
It’s the usual stuff but close-up so lots of opportunity to argue and heckle.  No slides or graphs.  My plan is to hand out 30-50 index cards, each with a phrase (for example, “Moderation in the pursuit of moderation is no vice” or “Gerrymandering is good for you” or “How to predict elections”), then participants can call out topics and I’ll yap on them (with discussion) till we run out of time.

<p>Introduction: What we did in our Stan meeting yesterday:
 
Some discussion of revision of the Nuts paper, some conversations about parameterizations of categorical-data models, plans for the R interface, blah blah blah.
 
But also, I had two exciting new ideas!
 
 Google Translate for code 
 
Wouldn’t it be great if Google Translate could work on computer languages?  I suggested this and somebody said that it might be a problem because code isn’t always translatable.  But that doesn’t worry so much.  Google Translate for human languages isn’t perfect either but it’s a useful guide.  If I want to write a message to someone in French or Spanish or Dutch, I wouldn’t just write it in English and run it through Translate.  What I do is try my best to write it in the desired language, but I can try out some tricky words or phrases in the translator.  Or, if I start by translating, I go back and forth to make sure it all makes sense.

<p>Introduction: From blogger  Matthew Yglesias :
 
 
 
There are lots of great graphs all over the web (see, for example,  here  and  here  for some snappy pictures of unemployment trends from blogger “Geoff”).
 
There’s nothing special about Yglesias’s graph.  In fact, the reason I’m singling it out as “graph of the year” is  because  it’s not special.
  

 
It’s a display of three numbers, with no subtlety or artistry in its presentation.  True, it has some good features: 
- Clear title 
- Clearly labeled axes 
- Vertical axis goes to zero 
- The cities are in a sensible order (not, for example, alphabetical) 
- The graphs is readable; none of that 3-D “data visualization” crap that looks cool but distances the reader from the numbers being displayed.
 
What’s impressive about the above graph, what makes it a landmark to me, is that it was made at all.  As noted in the text immediately below the image, it’s a display of exactly three numbers which can with little effort be completely presented and e</p><p>2 0.17701855 <a title="488-tfidf-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-31-A_data_visualization_manifesto.html">61 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-31-A data visualization manifesto</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details? 
 
Aleks pointed me to  this article  by Jeffrey Heer, Michael Bostock, and Vadim Ogievetsky, “A Tour through the Visualization Zoo:  A survey of powerful visualization techniques, from the obvious to the obscure.”  Th</p><p>3 0.17391413 <a title="488-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.16603412 <a title="488-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-20-Ugly_ugly_ugly.html">1684 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-20-Ugly ugly ugly</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

But what’s the “mean”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the context of a discussion of Democratic party strategies, Matthew Yglesias  writes :
  
Given where things stood in January 2009, large House losses were essentially inevitable. The Democratic majority elected in 2008 was totally unsustainable and was doomed by basic regression to the mean.
  
I’d like to push back on this, if for no other reason than that  I  didn’t foresee all this back in January 2009.
 
Regression to the mean is a fine idea, but what’s the “mean” that you’re regressing to?  Here’s a graph I made  a couple years ago , showing the time series of Democratic vote share in congressional and presidential elections:
 
 
 
Take a look at the House vote in 2006 and 2008.  Is this a blip, just begging to be slammed down in 2010 by a regression to the mean?  Or does it represent a return to form, back to the 55% level of support that the Democrats had for most of the previous fifty years?  It’s not so obvious what to think–at least, not simply from looking at the graph.</p><p>6 0.1412552 <a title="488-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the subject line “Blog bait!”, Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  post at the Washington Post blog:
  
For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.


    
Infographic by Thomas Porostocky for WIRED.


“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>3 0.8979938 <a title="488-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-29-Infovis_vs._statgraphics%3A__A_clear_example_of_their_different_goals.html">829 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-29-Infovis vs. statgraphics:  A clear example of their different goals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.  It represents neither a dat</p><p>4 0.8808443 <a title="488-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-20-Ugly_ugly_ugly.html">1684 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-20-Ugly ugly ugly</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

<p>Introduction: From blogger  Matthew Yglesias :
 
 
 
There are lots of great graphs all over the web (see, for example,  here  and  here  for some snappy pictures of unemployment trends from blogger “Geoff”).
 
There’s nothing special about Yglesias’s graph.  In fact, the reason I’m singling it out as “graph of the year” is  because  it’s not special.
  

 
It’s a display of three numbers, with no subtlety or artistry in its presentation.  True, it has some good features: 
- Clear title 
- Clearly labeled axes 
- Vertical axis goes to zero 
- The cities are in a sensible order (not, for example, alphabetical) 
- The graphs is readable; none of that 3-D “data visualization” crap that looks cool but distances the reader from the numbers being displayed.
 
What’s impressive about the above graph, what makes it a landmark to me, is that it was made at all.  As noted in the text immediately below the image, it’s a display of exactly three numbers which can with little effort be completely presented and e</p><p>2 0.88098764 <a title="488-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-27-Annals_of_spam.html">1871 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-27-Annals of spam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email, subject line “Want to Buy Text Link from andrewgelman.com”: 
  
  
Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got. Also kindly note that I can buy 1 to 50 links from one site – so you should understand the scale of the project. If you have multiple sites with co</p><p>3 0.88077235 <a title="488-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-10-Fourteen_magic_words%3A_an_update.html">898 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-10-Fourteen magic words: an update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.


Four outliers were excl</p><p>4 0.8804872 <a title="488-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis_testing_with_multiple_imputations.html">799 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-Hypothesis testing with multiple imputations</a></p>

I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution? Do I combine the 5 imputed data set into one by averaging each imputed values so I get one single imputed data and compare with the ob</p><p>5 0.87914884 <a title="488-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-05-The_Grinch_Comes_Back.html">1606 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-05-The Grinch Comes Back</a></p>

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.

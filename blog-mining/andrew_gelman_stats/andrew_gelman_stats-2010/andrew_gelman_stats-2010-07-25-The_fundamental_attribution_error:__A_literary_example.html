<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog will know that I’m always on the lookout for new items for the  lexicon .  It’s been a good month on that front.  In addition to the Garden of Forking Paths, I’ve encountered two entirely new (to me) fallacies.
 
The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!
 
Here’s the story.  The other day on the sister blog I  reported  on a pair of studies involving children and political orientation:  Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely</p><p>4 0.64729613 <a title="163-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-15-Mary%2C_Mary%2C_why_ya_buggin.html">2212 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-15-Mary, Mary, why ya buggin</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In our Cliff  thread  from yesterday, sociologist Philip Cohen pointed to  his discussions  in the decline in the popularity of the name Mary.
 
One thing that came up was the traditional trendiness of girls’ names.  So I thought I’d share my thoughts from a couple of years ago, as  reported  by David Leonhardt:
  
Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia and an amateur name-ologist, argues that many parents want their boys to seem mature and so pick classic names. William, David, Joseph and James, all longtime stalwarts, remain in the Top 20.


With girls, Gelman says, parents are attracted to names that convey youth even into adulthood and choose names that seem to be on the upswing. By the 1990s, of course, not many girls from the 1880s were still around, and that era’s names could seem fresh again. This search for youthfulness makes girls’ names more volatile — and increasingly so, as more statistics about names become available and parents grow more willing to experiment</p><p>5 0.6078428 <a title="163-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-23-Charles_Murray%E2%80%99s_%E2%80%9CComing_Apart%E2%80%9D_and_the_measurement_of_social_and_political_divisions.html">1819 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-23-Charles Murray’s “Coming Apart” and the measurement of social and political divisions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on our  blog discussions  a year ago, I published a review of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart,” for the journal Statistics, Politics, and Policy.  I invited Murray to publish a response, and he did so.
 
Here’s the abstract to  my review :
  
This article examines some claims made in a recent popular book of political sociology, with the intent not being to debunk any claims but rather to connect some important social and policy positions to statistical data on income, social class, and political attitudes. The thesis of Charles Murray’s book is that America’s upper and lower classes have become increasingly separate, with elites living more disciplined, orderly lives (characterized by marriage, work, and stable families) while being largely unaware of the lifestyles of the majority of Americans. I argue that some of Murray’s conclusions are sensitive to particular choices of whom to label as elite or upper-class.

<p>Introduction: From “Judge Savage,” by Tim Parks:
  
That evening, Daniel called Hilary’s parents.  These people always disliked me, he knew.  He had never understood if it was a racial thing, or whether they would have disliked any partner of Hilary’s.
  
Very clever.  Parks demonstrates Daniel’s blind spot–he can’t imagine that maybe Hilary’s parents hate him because of his unpleasant personality–but does it entirely from Daniel’s perspective.  I wonder if this just came naturally to Parks, or whether he figured it out as a puzzle to solve–how to convey a blind spot from the perspective of the person looking and not noticing it–or whether Parks wasn’t thinking at all about this and it just happened.
 
Considering the character Daniel’s psychology, I’d consider the above as an example of the so-called fundamental attribution error, in that he’s attributing Hilary’s parents dislike of him to situational factors rather than to his own personality.
 
I’ll have more on “Judge Savage” later (on the topic</p><p>2 0.85332251 <a title="163-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-06-Leahy_Versus_Albedoman_and_the_Moneygoround%2C_Part_One.html">1885 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-06-Leahy Versus Albedoman and the Moneygoround, Part One</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edward Wyatt  reports :
  
Now the Obama administration is cracking down on what many call  patent trolls , shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid . . . “The United States patent system is vital for our economic growth, job creation, and technological advance,” [Senator] Leahy said in a statement. “Unfortunately, misuse of low-quality patents through patent trolling has tarnished the system’s image.”
  
There is some opposition:
  
But some big software companies, including Microsoft, expressed dismay at some of the proposals, saying they could themselves stifle innovation.
  
Microsoft . . . patent trolls . . . hmmm, where have we heard this connection  before ?
 
There is also some support for the bill:

<p>Introduction: Xian and I respond to the four discussants of our paper, “Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference.”  Here’s the abstract of  our rejoinder :
  
Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood. The present article arose from our memory of a particularly intemperate anti-Bayesian statement that appeared in Feller’s beautiful and classic book on probability theory. We felt that it was worth exploring the very extremeness of Feller’s words, along with similar anti-Bayesian remarks by others, in order to better understand the background underlying contr</p><p>5 0.79281473 <a title="163-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-07-Bechdel_wasn%E2%80%99t_kidding.html">701 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-07-Bechdel wasn’t kidding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog know about  the Bechdel test  for movies:
 
1. It has to have at least two women in it 
2. Who talk to each other 
3. About something besides a man
 
Amusing, huh?  But I only really got the point the other day, when I was on a plane and passively watched parts of the in-flight movie.  It was something I’d never heard of (of course) and it happened to be a chick flick–even without the soundtrack, it was clear that the main character was a woman and much of it was about her love life.  But even this movie failed the Bechdel test miserably!  I don’t even think it passed item #1 above, but if it did, it certainly failed #2.
 
If even the chick flicks are failing the Bechdel test, then, yeah, we’re really in trouble.  And don’t get me started on those old Warner Brothers cartoons.  They’re great but they feature about as many female characters as the average WWII submarine.  Sure, everybody knows this, but it’s still striking to think about just how unbalanced</p><p>6 0.77924556 <a title="163-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-06-New_words_of_1917.html">1970 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-06-New words of 1917</a></p>

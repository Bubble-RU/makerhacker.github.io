</p><p>2 Hibbs clarifies:    Although this essay features some predictions about likely outcomes of the 2010 election for the US House of Representatives, the underlying statistical model is meant to be structural or causal and is not targeted on forecasting accuracy. [sent-4, score-0.648]
</p><p>3 The model presented in this essay is designed to explain midterm House election outcomes in terms of systematic predetermined and exogenous factors rather than to deliver optimal predictions. [sent-5, score-0.947]
</p><p>4 For that reason the model does not include trend terms or polling measurements of the publics political sentiments and voting intentions of the sort populating forecasting equations. [sent-6, score-0.335]

</p><p>7 What really matters politically is the partisan division of seats, and that is the object of attention here. [sent-13, score-0.19]
</p><p>8 Even if your sole goal is to forecast seats, I think the most efficient way to do this is to forecast national vote trends, and then apply the national swing to each district, correcting for incumbency and uncontestedness where appropriate. [sent-15, score-0.803]

</p><p>10 I mean, sure, it’s ok to forecast seats directly. [sent-18, score-0.621]
</p><p>11 It’s simple, clear, and less effort than forecasting votes and then doing the district-by-district work of transmuting vote swings to expected seat swings. [sent-19, score-0.61]
</p><p>12 But it’s nothing to be proud of–it’s certainly not  better  than modeling votes, then seats. [sent-20, score-0.058]
</p><p>13 The real point is the connection between the economy and the vote, and on that topic Hibbs has interesting things to say. [sent-22, score-0.164]

How many House seats will the Republicans gain in 2010? . . . Our methodology replicates that for our ultimately successful forecast of the 2006 midterm. Two weeks before Election Day in 2006, we posted  a prediction that the Democrats would gain 32 seats and recapture the House majority. The Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006. Our current forecast for 2010 shows that the Republicans are likely to regain the House majority. . . . the most likely scenario is  a Republican majority in the neighborhood of 229 seats versus 206 for the Democrats for a 50-seat loss for the Democrats .
  
How do they do it?  First, they predict the national two-party vote using the generic polls (asking voters which party they plan to vote for in the November congressional elections).  Then they apply the national vote swing on a district-by-district level to predict the outcome in each district.

<p>Introduction: Some recent blog comments made me rethink how to express disagreement when I write.  I’ll first display my original blog entry, then some of the comments, then my reaction, and finally my new approach.  As usual with negative comments, my first reaction was to be upset, but once the hurt feelings went away, I realized that these dudes had a point.
 
 Act 1 
 
A few days I ago, I posted the following on 538:
  
Self-described “ political operative ” Les Francis, with real-world experience as former executive director of the Democratic National Committee:

 
I don’t need any polls to tell me that Republicans will do well in November. The “out” party almost always shows significant gains in the first midterm election of a new President. 
 

 Political scientists  Joe Bafumi, Bob Erikson, and Chris Wlezien, from elite, out-of-touch, ivory-tower institutions Dartmouth, Columbia, and Temple Universities:


   


Game over.
  
 Act 2 
 
After posting, I typically check the comments because so</p><p>4 0.2522108 <a title="292-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-Comparison_of_forecasts_for_the_2010_congressional_elections.html">270 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-Comparison of forecasts for the 2010 congressional elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>5 0.23758513 <a title="292-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Two_stories_about_the_election_that_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">384 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Two stories about the election that I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>6 0.19031297 <a title="292-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery talk sense  here .  I am perhaps too influenced by Steven Rosenstoneâ&euro;&trade;s 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections, which is the first thing I read on the topic.  In any case, I agree with Nyhan and Montgomery that the difference in vote, comparing a centrist candidate to an extreme candidate, is probably on the order of 1-2%, not the 4% that has been posited by some.
 
Among other things, ideological differences between candidates of the same party might seem big in the primaries, but then when the general election comes along, party ID becomes more important.
 
I also disagree with the model in which presidential elections are like votes for high school  prom king .</p><p>5 0.82843989 <a title="292-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>6 0.77977633 <a title="292-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo%21.html">934 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010. The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>2 0.89294195 <a title="292-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-23-AI_Stats_conference_on_Stan_etc..html">1911 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-23-AI Stats conference on Stan etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After writing  yesterday’s post , I was going through Solomon Hsiang’s blog and found  a post  pointing to three studies from researchers at business schools:
  
Severe Weather and Automobile Assembly Productivity


Gérard P. Cachon, Santiago Gallino and Marcelo Olivares


Abstract: It is expected that climate change could lead to an increased frequency of severe weather. In turn, severe weather intuitively should hamper the productivity of work that occurs outside. But what is the effect of rain, snow, fog, heat and wind on work that occurs indoors, such as the production of automobiles? Using weekly production data from 64 automobile plants in the United States over a ten-year period, we ﬁnd that adverse weather conditions lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in production. For example, one additional day of high wind advisory by the National Weather Service (i.e., maximum winds generally in excess of 44 miles per hour) reduces production by 26%, which is comparable in order of magnitude t</p><p>5 0.85134459 <a title="292-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-27-Visual_diagnostics_for_discrete-data_regressions.html">929 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-27-Visual diagnostics for discrete-data regressions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff asked me what I thought of  this  recent AJPS article by Brian Greenhill, Michael Ward, and Audrey Sacks, “The Separation Plot: A New Visual Method for Evaluating the Fit of Binary Models.”  It’s similar to a graph of observed vs. predicted values, but using color rather than the y-axis to display the observed values.  It seems like it could be useful, also could be applied more generally to discrete-data regressions with more than two categories.
 
When it comes to checking the model fit, I recommend binned residual plots, as discussed in  this 2000 article  with Yuri Goegebeur, Francis Tuerlinckx, and Iven Van Mechelen.</p><p>6 0.84838903 <a title="292-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-23-Life_in_the_C-suite%3A__A_graph_that_is_both_ugly_and_bad%2C_and_an_unrelated_story.html">1734 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-23-Life in the C-suite:  A graph that is both ugly and bad, and an unrelated story</a></p>

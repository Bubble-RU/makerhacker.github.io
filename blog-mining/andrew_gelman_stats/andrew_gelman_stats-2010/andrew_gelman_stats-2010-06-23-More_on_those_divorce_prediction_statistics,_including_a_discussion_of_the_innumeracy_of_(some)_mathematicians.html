The question I raised was:  how could someone who was evidently so intelligent and accomplished—Gottman, that is—get things so wrong?  My brief conclusion was that once you have some success, I guess there’s not much of a motivation to change your ways.  Also, I could well believe that, for all its flaws, Gottman’s work is better than much of the other research out there on marriages.  There’s still the question of how this stuff gets published in scientific journals. I haven’t looked at Gottman’s articles in detail and so don’t really have thoughts on that one.
 
Anyway, I recently corresponded with a mathematician who had heard of Gottman’s research and wrote</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 A few months ago, I  blogged  on John Gottman, a psychologist whose headline-grabbing research on marriages (he got himself featured in Blink with a claim that he could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced—after meeting with them for 15 minutes! [sent-1, score-0.394]
</p><p>2 I think she drops the ball, though, in the section you quote about false negatives and false positives. [sent-11, score-0.365]
</p><p>3 ”  But if he’s trying to predict early divorce, an event with 16% prevalence, I think it’s safe to say he does NOT mean “My method assigns a prediction of divorce to 20% of couples that didn’t actually divorce” — presumably the TOTAL number of positives his method gives is somewhere around 16%. [sent-13, score-1.103]
</p><p>4 A much more natural interpretation of what he might mean by “80% accurate” is “the method gives the the right answer in 80% of cases” — of course, it would be richer information to report the false positive and false negative rate separately. [sent-14, score-0.397]
</p><p>5 The mathematician then replied to me:    A psychologist colleague convinced me my initial reaction was too hard on Gottman. [sent-18, score-0.211]
</p><p>6 )  He finds the optimal linear combination of x_1 … x_n for predicting divorce, and similarly for y_1, … y_n. [sent-24, score-0.276]
</p><p>7 He doesn’t report rates of false positives and false negatives separately, but he does report correlation between his linear combination of y_1, … y_n and (I think) the Bernoulli variable of divorce/not divorce, and gets something highly positive (with x_1, … x_n, it’s just slightly positive. [sent-27, score-0.836]
</p><p>8 )  So that’s not consistent with, say, his model always predicting no divorce, or predicting that a randomly chosen 16% of the couples will divorce, which would give correlations of 0. [sent-28, score-0.321]
</p><p>9 It IS consistent, I think, with numbers like Abraham’s, in which half of the couples he predicts will divorce actually stay together. [sent-29, score-0.839]
</p><p>10 But I don’t think this really counts as remaking the model each time to fit the data; he has committed to this small set of variables, and replicates the finding that these variables explain more of the variation in some variable of interest than do competing sets of measurements. [sent-33, score-0.258]
</p><p>11 I’m just saying that it doesn’t seem to be methodologically necessary that he commits himself after his first paper to a specific linear combination of y_1, … y_n which is to be his divorce prediction variable for all time. [sent-37, score-0.651]
</p><p>12 A relevant question is:  if you have a binary variable, and n other measurements, presumably you should expect to be able to find SOME linear combination of y_1 … y_n that has a healthy positive correlation with the binary variable. [sent-39, score-0.561]
</p><p>13 But how positive a correlation does one expect to find, for a given n, under a null hypothesis that the y_i are actually independent from the binary variable? [sent-40, score-0.304]
</p><p>14 Part of the problem I guess is that his y_i are presumably correlated with each other and I guess that affects the answer. [sent-42, score-0.199]
</p><p>15 I guess my sense after looking at this stuff is that there’s really nothing wrong with Gottman’s published work, but that there is something wrong with Gladwell’s description of it, and to be honest, probably something wrong with Gottman’s own non-academic sales pitch for his own results. [sent-44, score-0.321]
</p><p>16 I think the correct statistical critique is just the very basic one that the claim as written is empty:  that if you want to predict whether a couple will divorce or stay together with 80% accuracy, you can just predict every couple will stay together. [sent-46, score-1.146]
</p><p>17 To a statistician, it’s obvious that you can predict divorces to high accuracy over a 3-yr period by just saying that everyone will stay married, and those numbers such as 80% or 93% will raise suspicion. [sent-49, score-0.528]
</p><p>18 Recall  this quote  from Gottman’s collabroator, James Murray:   “The forecast of who would get divorced in his study of 700 couples over 12 years was 100 per cent correct, he said. [sent-51, score-0.29]
</p><p>19 But “what reduced the accuracy of our predictions was those couples who we thought would stay married and unhappy actually ended up getting divorced”. [sent-52, score-0.503]
</p><p>20 To put it another way:  Gottman’s work could very well be useful, even if he doesn’t predict divorces at all, he could be developing good techniques for marriage counselors. [sent-54, score-0.33]

I added the following:
  
Gottman’s claim of 81% or 90% accuracy is misleading, however, because the accuracy is measured only  after  fitting a model to his data.

<p>Introduction: The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society publishes papers followed by discussions.  Lots of discussions, each can be no more than 400 words.  Here’s my most recent discussion:
  
The authors are working on an important applied problem and I have no reason to doubt that their approach is a step forward beyond diagnostic criteria based on point estimation.  An attempt at an accurate assessment of variation is important not just for statistical reasons but also because scientists have the duty to convey their uncertainty to the larger world.  I am thinking, for example, of discredited claims such as that of the mathematician who claimed to predict divorces with 93% accuracy (Abraham, 2010).


Regarding the paper at hand, I thought I would try an experiment in comment-writing.  My usual practice is to read the graphs and then go back and clarify any questions through the text.  So, very quickly:  I would prefer Figure 1 to be displayed in terms of standard deviations, not variances.

<p>Introduction: I was given the opportunity to briefly comment on the  paper , A Bayesian approach to complex clinical diagnoses: a case-study in child abuse, by Nicky Best, Deborah Ashby, Frank Dunstan, David Foreman, and Neil McIntosh, for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

<p>Introduction: Nick Brown is bothered by  this article , “An unscented Kalman filter approach to the estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems models,” by Sy-Miin Chow, Emilio Ferrer, and John Nesselroade.  The introduction of the article cites a bunch of articles in serious psych/statistics journals.  The question is, are such advanced statistical techniques really needed, or even legitimate, with the kind of very rough data that is usually available in psych applications? Or is it just fishing in the hope of discovering patterns that are not really there?
 
I wrote:
 
It seems like a pretty innocuous literature review.  I agree that many of the applications are silly (for example, they cite the work of the notorious  John Gottman  in fitting a predator-prey model to spousal relations (!)), but overall they just seem to be presenting very standard ideas for the mathematical-psychology audience.

The obvious response of people like us is why ask such people when they didn’t foresee a month ago that these dynamic events were about to happen.  One would instead like to hear from those experts that did predict that something was about to happen in Tunisia, and Egypt, and Jordan, and maybe Yemen, etc.  Well, are there such people?  My friend Bob Burton says that of course one can find such people in the sense that they made such predictions, but that is like finding counties that have voted for the President in the last five elections, big deal, or psychics that predicted the last assassination, again big deal.  There is a good deal of truth in that.  However, it seems like we do a little better.  There are two points to make. First, there is an i</p><p>4 0.78370088 <a title="105-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Forensic_bioinformatics%2C_or%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_believe_everything_you_read_in_the_%28scientific%29_papers.html">360 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Forensic bioinformatics, or, Don’t believe everything you read in the (scientific) papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.  But usually I don’t drift too far from reality because I have a lot of cross-checks and I (or my</p><p>5 0.75577837 <a title="105-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-07-The_more_likely_it_is_to_be_X%2C_the_more_likely_it_is_to_be_Not_X%3F.html">1158 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-07-The more likely it is to be X, the more likely it is to be Not X?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>6 0.75528461 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding_the_p-value.html">1760 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding the p-value</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After hearing a few times about the divorce predictions of researchers John Gottman and James Murray (work that was featured in Blink with a claim that they could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced–after meeting with them for 15 minutes) and  feeling some skepticism , I decided to do the Lord’s work and amend Gottman’s wikipedia entry, which had a paragraph saying:
  
Gottman found his methodology predicts with 90% accuracy which newlywed couples will remain married and which will divorce four to six years later. It is also 81% percent accurate in predicting which marriages will survive after seven to nine years.
  
I added the following:
  
Gottman’s claim of 81% or 90% accuracy is misleading, however, because the accuracy is measured only  after  fitting a model to his data. There is no evidence that he can predict the outcome of a marriage with high accuracy in advance.

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  blogged  on John Gottman, a psychologist whose headline-grabbing research on marriages (he got himself featured in Blink with a claim that he could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced—after meeting with them for 15 minutes!) was recently debunked in a book by Laurie Abraham.
 
The question I raised was:  how could someone who was evidently so intelligent and accomplished—Gottman, that is—get things so wrong?  My brief conclusion was that once you have some success, I guess there’s not much of a motivation to change your ways.  Also, I could well believe that, for all its flaws, Gottman’s work is better than much of the other research out there on marriages.  There’s still the question of how this stuff gets published in scientific journals. I haven’t looked at Gottman’s articles in detail and so don’t really have thoughts on that one.
 
Anyway, I recently corresponded with a mathematician who had heard of Gottman’s research and wrote</p><p>4 0.95329964 <a title="105-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-A_redrawing_of_the_Red-Blue_map_in_November_2010%3F.html">362 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-A redrawing of the Red-Blue map in November 2010?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states. In light of this correlation, would you say that there currently is</p><p>5 0.94989133 <a title="105-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-17-The_disappearing_or_non-disappearing_middle_class.html">1767 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-17-The disappearing or non-disappearing middle class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Despite the title, this post is mostly not about economics or even politics but rather about the central role of  comparisons  in statistics and statistical graphics.
 
It started when someone pointed me to  this article  in which Megan McArdle points out the misleadingness of a graph that seems to show a bimodal income distribution but only by combining cells in the tail:
 
 
 
McArdle makes a good point:  of course, if you spread the histogram along a uniform scale (or, for that matter, a log scale), you don’t see that bump at the high end.  McArdle reproduces some Census charts showing income stability over the past few decades:
 
 
 
Before I had a chance to chance to write about this, I noticed that Mark Palko  did the job  for me.  Palko writes:

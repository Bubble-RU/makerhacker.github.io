<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar  writes :
  
While bike theft is an epidemic in major US cities, most people seem resigned that it’s just a fact of life. . . . at Priceonomics, we thought we’d take a crack at trying to reduce bike theft. Could we use software to help people fight back against bike thieves?


Professional bike thieves exist because they can make a profit. Luckily, this author went to business school and remembers exactly one equation from the experience:


Profit = Revenue – Cost


From a criminal’s perspective, the “Cost” of bike theft is about zero. The odds of getting caught are negligible and the penalty is about zero as well. Most commentators suggest that in order to prevent bike theft, the government should increase the penalties to make it a less attractive crime. As we stated earlier, we somehow doubt government intervention is going to happen any time soon.


We decided to focus on the revenue half of the equation.

<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.

<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .

 Robert Zubrin  writes in  “How Much Is an Astronaut’s Life Worth?”  ( Reason ,  Feb 2012 ):
     
…policy analyst John D. Graham and his colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found in 1997 that the median cost for lifesaving expenditures and regulations by the U.S. government in the health care, residential, transportation, and occupational areas ranges from about $1 million to $3 million spent per life saved in today’s dollars. The only marked exception to this pattern occurs in the area of environmental health protection (such as the Superfund program) which costs about $200 million per life saved.


Graham and his colleagues call the latter kind of inefficiency “ statistical murder ,” since thousands of additional lives could be saved each year if the money were used more cost-effectively. To avoid such deadly waste, the Department of Transportation has a policy of rejecting any proposed safety expenditure that costs more than $3</p><p>6 0.11755103 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-18-Bike_shelf.html">349 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-18-Bike shelf</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV.

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>4 0.81137627 <a title="68-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-The_Fixie_Bike_Index.html">1127 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-The Fixie Bike Index</a></p>

Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>2 0.96423268 <a title="68-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-12-%E2%80%9CA_tangle_of_unexamined_emotional_impulses_and_illogical_responses%E2%80%9D.html">1935 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-12-“A tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.
 
I’m guessing that the taxi driver quoted above is subject to the same illusions</p><p>3 0.95362532 <a title="68-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-21-%E2%80%9CReadability%E2%80%9D_as_freedom_from_the_actual_sensation_of_reading.html">1179 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-21-“Readability” as freedom from the actual sensation of reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

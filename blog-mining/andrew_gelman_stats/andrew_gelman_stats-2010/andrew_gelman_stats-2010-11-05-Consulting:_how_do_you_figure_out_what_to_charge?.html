<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.

I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals.

<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu has posted a series of reflections  here ,  here , and  here  on the dominance of graduates of HYPS (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford (in that order, I believe)) in various Master-of-the-Universe-type jobs at “elite law firms, consultancies, and I-banks, hedge/venture funds, startups, and technology companies.”  Hsu writes:
  
In the real world, people believe in folk notions of brainpower or IQ. (“Quick on the uptake”, “Picks things up really fast”, “A sponge” …) They count on elite educational institutions to do their g-filtering for them. . . .


Most top firms only recruit at a few schools. A kid from a non-elite UG school has very little chance of finding a job at one of these places unless they first go to grad school at, e.g., HBS, HLS, or get a PhD from a top place. (By top place I don’t mean “gee US News says Ohio State’s Aero E program is top 5!” — I mean, e.g., a math PhD from Berkeley or a PhD in computer science from MIT — the traditional top dogs in academ</p><p>6 0.13282938 <a title="395-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-01-Doing_Data_Science%3A__What%E2%80%99s_it_all_about%3F.html">2084 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-01-Doing Data Science:  What’s it all about?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.

<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.  I’d like to think that if</p><p>6 0.84187371 <a title="395-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-17-Credentialism%2C_elite_employment%2C_and_career_aspirations.html">578 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-17-Credentialism, elite employment, and career aspirations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>same-blog 2 0.98591721 <a title="395-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-Consulting%3A_how_do_you_figure_out_what_to_charge%3F.html">395 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-Consulting: how do you figure out what to charge?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a physicist by training, statistical data analyst by trade.  Although some of my work is pretty standard statistical analysis, more often I work somewhere in a gray area that includes physics, engineering, and statistics. I have very little formal statistics training but I do study in an academic-like way to learn techniques from the literature when I need to.  I do some things well but there are big gaps in my stats knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in statistics.  On the other hand, there are big gaps in most statisticians’ physics and engineering knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in physics. Generally my breadth and depth of knowledge is about right for the kind of work that I do, I think. 
 
But last week I was offered a consulting job that might be better done by someone with more conventional stats knowledge than I have.  The job involves gene expression in different types of tumors, so it’s “biostatistics” by definition, but the</p><p>3 0.98208219 <a title="395-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-09-A_tale_of_two_discussion_papers.html">1848 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-09-A tale of two discussion papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I’ve written a dozen or so journal articles that have appeared with discussions, and I’ve participated in many published discussions of others’ articles as well.  I get a lot out of these article-discussion-rejoinder packages, in all three of my roles as reader, writer, and discussant.
 
 Part 1:  The story of an unsuccessful discussion 
 
The first time I had a discussion article was the result of an unfortunate circumstance.  I had a research idea that resulted in an  article  with Don Rubin on monitoring the mixing of Markov chain simulations. I new the idea was great, but back then we worked pretty slowly so it was awhile before we had a final version to submit to a journal.  (In retrospect I wish I’d just submitted the  draft version  as it was.)  In the meantime I presented the paper at a conference.  Our idea was very well received (I had a sheet of paper so people could write their names and addresses to get preprints, and we got either 50 or 150 (I can’t remembe</p><p>4 0.98192453 <a title="395-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-13-Judea_Pearl_overview_on_causal_inference%2C_and_more_general_thoughts_on_the_reexpression_of_existing_methods_by_considering_their_implicit_assumptions.html">2170 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-13-Judea Pearl overview on causal inference, and more general thoughts on the reexpression of existing methods by considering their implicit assumptions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  material should be familiar to many of you but could be helpful to newcomers.  Pearl writes:
  
ALL causal conclusions in nonexperimental settings must be based on untested, judgmental assumptions that investigators are prepared to defend on scientific grounds. . . .


To understand what the world should be like for a given procedure to work is of no lesser scientific value than seeking evidence for how the world works . . .


Assumptions are self-destructive in their honesty. The more explicit the assumption, the more criticism it invites . . . causal diagrams invite the harshest criticism because they make assumptions more explicit and more transparent than other representation schemes.
  
As regular readers know (for example, search this blog for “Pearl”), I have not got much out of the causal-diagrams approach myself, but in general I think that when there are multiple, mathematically equivalent methods of getting the same answer, we tend to go with the framework we are used</p><p>5 0.98139441 <a title="395-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Cross-validation_%28What_is_it_good_for%3F%29.html">1395 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Cross-validation (What is it good for?)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think cross-validation is a good way to estimate a model’s forecasting error but I don’t think it’s always such a great tool for comparing models.  I mean, sure, if the differences are dramatic, ok.  But you can easily have a few candidate models, and one model makes a lot more sense than the others (even from a purely predictive sense, I’m not talking about causality here).  The difference between the model doesn’t show up in a xval measure of total error but in the patterns of the predictions.
 
For a simple example, imagine using a linear model with positive slope to model a function that is constrained to be increasing.  If the constraint isn’t in the model, the predicted/imputed series will sometimes be nonmonotonic.  The effect on the prediction error can be so tiny as to be undetectable (or it might even increase avg prediction error to include the constraint); nonetheless, the predictions will be clearly nonsensical.
 
That’s an extreme example but I think the general point h</p><p>6 0.97982645 <a title="395-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-06-That_silly_ESP_paper_and_some_silliness_in_a_rebuttal_as_well.html">506 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-06-That silly ESP paper and some silliness in a rebuttal as well</a></p>

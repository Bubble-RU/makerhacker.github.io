<p>Introduction: Gayle Laackmann  reports  ( link  from Felix Salmon) that Microsoft, Google, etc. don’t actually ask brain-teasers in their job interviews.  The actually ask a lot of questions about programming.  (I looked  here  and was relieved to see that the questions aren’t very hard.  I could probably get a job as an entry-level programmer if I needed to.)

<p>Introduction: Raghu Parthasarathy sends along  this article  by C. Glenn Begley listing six questions to ask when worried about unreplicable work in biology:
  
Were experiments performed blinded?  (Even animal studies should be blinded when it comes to the recording and interpretation of the data—do you hear that, Mark Hauser?)


Were basic experiments repeated?  (“If reports fail to state that experiments were repeated, be sceptical.”)


Were all the results presented?  (That one’s a  biggie .)


Were there positive and negative controls?  (He offers some details from lab experiments.)


Were reagents validated?  (Whatever.)


Were statistical tests appropriate?  (I don’t like the idea of statistical “tests” at all, but I agree with his general point.)</p><p>5 0.081940532 <a title="233-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-18-Subtle_statistical_issues_to_be_debated_on_TV..html">350 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-18-Subtle statistical issues to be debated on TV.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There is live debate that will available this week for those that might be interested.  The topic:  Can early stopped trials result in misleading results of systematic reviews?
  

 
It’s sponsored by the Cochrane Collaboration and although the level of discussion is often not very technical, it does in my opinion provide a nice window into clinical research and as Tukey might put it “the real uncertainties involved”. 
 
(As a disclaimer – I once assigned some reading from this group to my graduate students and they were embarrassed and annoyed at the awkward handling of even minor technical issues – but the statistical research community is not their target audience.)
 
I have a favourite in this debate, and a quick search on co-authors (not me) would likely tip that off to most members of this blog. 
 
Here’s the directions kindly supplied by Jonathan Sterne, who will be in the chair.

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.  But still.</p><p>3 0.72288346 <a title="233-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-05-Wacky_interview_questions%3A__An_exploration_into_the_nature_of_evidence_on_the_internet.html">505 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-05-Wacky interview questions:  An exploration into the nature of evidence on the internet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  story  (“Yale tells students to keep Kissinger talk secret . . . ‘Dr. Kissinger’s visit to campus will not be publicized, so we appreciate your confidentiality…’”) reminds me of two things:
 
- In the 1980s, I once went to a public lecture at Harvard by Kissinger protogé Ted Koppel, who indeed has that deep Ted Koppel voice even when he’s just chatting (as I overheard).  Koppel insisted that the contents of his talk not be reported.  It was no great loss; he didn’t really have anything newsworthy to say.  The talk was fine, he told us some interesting things, just nothing that would’ve made the news or even the campus newspaper.  Still, it seemed kinda tacky for a reporter whose shtick was access to the powerful, to not want his own speech to be reported. 
 
- In the 1990s, a colleague of mine in a different dept told us that this professor from another university was coming by to give a lecture.  I told my colleague that I’d like to meet with the guy, as I wanted to ask his opin</p><p>5 0.70703262 <a title="233-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-The_hare%2C_the_pineapple%2C_and_Ed_Wegman.html">1307 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-The hare, the pineapple, and Ed Wegman</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenters here are occasionally bothered that I spend so much time attacking frauds and plagiarists.  See, for example,  here  and  here .  Why go on and on about these losers, given that there are more important problems in the world such as war, pestilence, hunger, and graphs where the y-axis doesn’t go all the way down to zero?
 
Part of the story is that I do research for a living so I resent people who devalue research through misattribution or fraud, in the same way that rich people don’t like counterfeiters.
 
What really bugs me, though, is when cheaters get caught and still don’t admit it.  People like Hauser, Wegman, Fischer, and Weick get under my skin because they have the chutzpah to just deny deny deny.  The grainy time-stamped videotape with their hand in the cookie jar is right there, and they’ll still talk around the problem.  Makes me want to scream.
 
This happens  all the time .  All. Over. The. Place.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>3 0.8751384 <a title="233-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-04-Inequality_and_health.html">127 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-04-Inequality and health</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The other day I noticed a car with the improbable name of Nissan Rogue, from Darien, Connecticut (at least that’s what the license plate frame said).  And, after all, what could be more “rogue”-like than a suburban SUV?
 
I can’t blame the driver of the car for this one; I’m just amused that the marketers and Nissan thought this was an appropriate name for the car.</p><p>6 0.81558561 <a title="233-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-03-The_Employment_Nondiscrimination_Act_is_overwhelmingly_popular_in_nearly_every_one_of_the_50_states.html">2087 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-03-The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is overwhelmingly popular in nearly every one of the 50 states</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.17771144 <a title="400-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-23-No_one_knows_what_it%E2%80%99s_like_to_be_the_bad_man.html">1588 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-23-No one knows what it’s like to be the bad man</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader. That’s whose trust you’ve be</p><p>5 0.15172543 <a title="400-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>3 0.89476746 <a title="400-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-That_last_satisfaction_at_the_end_of_the_career.html">1568 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-That last satisfaction at the end of the career</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just finished reading an amusing but somewhat disturbing  article  by Mark Singer, a reporter for the New Yorker who follows in that magazine’s tradition of writing about amiable frauds.  (For those who are keeping score at home, Singer employs a McKelway-style relaxed tolerance rather than Liebling-style pyrotechnics.)  Singer’s topic was a midwestern dentist named Kip Litton who fradulently invented a side career for himself as a sub-3-hour marathoner.  What was amazing was not so much that Litton lied about his accomplishments but, rather, the huge efforts that he undertook to support these lies.  He went to faraway cities to not run marathons.  He fabricated multiple personas on running message boards.  He even invented an entire marathon and made up a list of participants.
 
This got me thinking about Ed Wegman (sorry!), the statistician who got tangled in a  series of plagiarism scandals .  As with Litton, once Wegman was caught once, energetic people looked at the records and</p><p>4 0.86160898 <a title="400-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Last_Wegman_post_%28for_now%29.html">766 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Last Wegman post (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  news article  by Eli Kintisch with the following wonderful quote:
  
Will Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who questions the consensus view on climate, thinks Mashey is a destructive force who uses “totalitarian tactics”–publishing damaging documents online, without peer review–to carry out personal vendettas.
  
I’ve never thought of uploading files as “totalitarian” but maybe they do things differently at Princeton.  I actually think of totalitarians as acting secretly–denunciations without evidence, midnight arrests, trials in undisclosed locations, and so forth.  Mashey’s practice of putting everything out in the open seems to me the opposite of totalitarian.
 
The article also reports that Edward Wegman’s lawyer said that Wegman “has never engaged in plagiarism.”  If I were the lawyer, I’d be pretty mad at Wegman at this point.  I can just imagine the conversation:

<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:

<p>Introduction: I was at a talk awhile ago where the speaker presented tables with 4, 5, 6, even 8 significant digits even though, as is usual, only the first or second digit of each number conveyed any useful information.  A graph would be better, but even if you’re too lazy to make a plot, a bit of rounding would seem to be required.
 
I mentioned this to a colleague, who responded:
  
I don’t know how to stop this practice.  Logic doesn’t work.  Maybe ridicule?  Best hope is the departure from field who do it.  (Theories don’t die, but the people who follow those theories retire.)
  
Another possibility, I think, is helpful software defaults.  If we can get to the people who write the software, maybe we could have some impact.
 
Once the software is written, however, it’s probably too late.  I’m not far from the center of the R universe, but I don’t know if I’ll ever succeed in my goals of increasing the default number of histogram bars or reducing the default number of decimal places in regression</p><p>4 0.92475557 <a title="400-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-04-Bayesian_Page_Rank%3F.html">1098 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-04-Bayesian Page Rank?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Loren Maxwell writes: 
  
  
I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.


For example, in the attached spreadsheet, Column D shows e</p><p>5 0.92037117 <a title="400-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-12-Get_the_Data.html">569 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-12-Get the Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  GetTheData , you can ask and answer data related questions. Here’s a preview:   
 
I’m not sure a Q&A; site is the best way to do this. 
 
My pipe dream is to create a taxonomy of variables and instances, and collect spreadsheets annotated this way. Imagine doing a search of type: “give me datasets, where an instance is a person, the variables are age, gender and weight” – and out would come datasets, each one tagged with the descriptions of the variables that were held constant for the whole dataset (person_type=student, location=Columbia, time_of_study=1/1/2009, study_type=longitudinal). It would even be possible to automatically convert one variable into another, if it was necessary (like age = time_of_measurement-time_of_birth). Maybe the dream of  Semantic Web  will actually be implemented for relatively structured statistical data rather than much fuzzier “knowledge”, just consider the difficulties of developing a universal  Freebase .

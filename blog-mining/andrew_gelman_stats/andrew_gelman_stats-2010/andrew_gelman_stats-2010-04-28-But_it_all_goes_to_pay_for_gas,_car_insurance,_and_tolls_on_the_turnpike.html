<p>Introduction: Ban Chuan Cheah writes: 
  
  
In a previous post, http://andrewgelman.com/2013/07/30/the-roy-causal-model/ you pointed to a paper on Bayesian methods by Heckman. At around the same time I came across another one of his papers, “The Effects of Cognitive and Noncognitive Abilities on Labor Market Outcomes and Social Behavior (2006)” (http://www.nber.org/papers/w12006 or published version http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/504455). In this paper they implement their model as follows:

 
We use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to compute the sample likelihood. Our use of Bayesian methods is only a computational convenience. Our identification analysis is strictly classical. Under our assumptions, the priors we use are asymptotically irrelevant.
 

Some of the authors have also done something similar earlier in:

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

I’ve noticed that you’ve quit approving my comments on your blog.  I hope I didn’t anger you in some way or write something you felt was inappropriate.
  
My reply:
 
I have not been unapproving any comments.  If you have comments that have not appeared, they have probably been going into the spam filter.  I get literally thousands of spam comments a day and so anything that hits the spam filter is gone forever.  I think there is a way to register as a commenter; that could help.</p><p>5 0.72204185 <a title="9-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-08-Annals_of_spam.html">1488 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-08-Annals of spam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have to go through the inbox to approve new comments.  When I set to auto-approve, I get overwhelmed with spam.  As is, I still get spam but it’s manageable.
 
Usually the spam is uninteresting but this one caught my eye:
 
   
 
At first this seemed reasonable enough:  law firm is desperate for business, spams blogs to raise its Google ranking.  But what’s with the writing in the actual comment?  It’s incoherent but it doesn’t look computer-generated.  My guess is that the law firm in Massachusetts hired a company that promised to raise their Google rankings, and that this company hired some non-English-speaking foreigners to search through the web and write some spam comments.  If anyone actually reads the comments, they might get the impression that this law firm is staffed by illiterates . . . but, as we all know, nobody reads blog comments!

<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

 
The hazards posed by climate change, sea level rise, and severe storm surges make this the time to transform our coastal cities through adaptive design. The conventional response to flooding, in recent history, has been hard engineering — fortifying the coastal infrastructure with seawalls and bulkheads to protect real estate at the expense of natural t</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91738355 <a title="9-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-But_it_all_goes_to_pay_for_gas%2C_car_insurance%2C_and_tolls_on_the_turnpike.html">9 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-But it all goes to pay for gas, car insurance, and tolls on the turnpike</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a New Yorker I think I’m obliged to pass on the occasional Jersey joke (most recently,  this one , which annoyingly continues to attract spam comments).  I’ll let the above title be my comment on this  entry  from Tyler Cowen entitled, “Which Americans are ‘best off’?”:
  
If you consult human development indices the answer is Asians living in New Jersey.  The standard is:

 
The index factors in life expectancy at birth, educational degree attainment among adults 25-years or older, school enrollment for people at least three years old and median annual gross personal earnings.
 
  
More generally, these sorts of rankings and ndexes seem to be cheap ways of grabbing headlines.  This has always irritated me but really maybe I should go with the flow and invent a few of these indexes myself.</p><p>3 0.89677018 <a title="9-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-04-Burgess_on_Kipling.html">16 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-04-Burgess on Kipling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my last entry derived from  Anthony Burgess’s book reviews , and it’ll be short.  His review of Angus Wilson’s “The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling:  His Life and Works” is a wonderfully balanced little thing.  Nothing incredibly deep–like most items in the collection, the review is only two pages long–but I give it credit for being a rare piece of Kipling criticism I’ve seen that (a) seriously engages with the politics, without (b) congratulating itself on bravely going against the fashions of the politically incorrect chattering classes by celebrating Kipling’s magnificent achievement blah blah blah.  Instead, Burgess shows respect for Kipling’s work and puts it in historical, biographical, and literary context.
 
Burgess concludes that Wilson’s book “reminds us, in John Gross’s words, that Kipling ‘remains a haunting, unsettling presence, with whom we still have to come to terms.’  Still.”  Well put, and generous of Burgess to end his review with another’s quote.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>5 0.86257732 <a title="9-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-07-Environmentally_induced_cancer_%E2%80%9Cgrossly_underestimated%E2%80%9D%3F__Doubtful..html">21 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-07-Environmentally induced cancer “grossly underestimated”?  Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>6 0.85670304 <a title="9-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-26-WAIC_and_cross-validation_in_Stan%21.html">2349 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-26-WAIC and cross-validation in Stan!</a></p>

I think our future estimates based on the 9-way model will be better, but these are basically OK, I think. All but six of the dots in the graph are based on sample sizes greater than 30.
 
I published these  last year  but they’re still relevant, I think.

Give an estimate of the probability that a nonvoter will falsely state that he or she voted. (Assume that all voters honestly report that they voted.)

 BPS Research Digest :  I haven’t been following this one recently, but it has lots of good links, I should probably check it more often.  There are a couple things that bother me, though.  The blog is sponsored by the British Psychological Society, so this sounds pretty serious.  But then they run things like advertising  promotions  sponsored by a textbook company and highlight iffy experimental claims.  For example, in 2010 they ran a wholly uncritical  post  on the notorious Daryl Bem study that purported to find ESP.  After being called on it in the comments, the blogger (Christian Jarrett) responded with, “The stats appear sound. . . . it’s a great study. Rigorously conducted” and even defended “the discussion of quantum physics in the paper.”  To be fair, though, and as he  points out  in comments, Jarrett wrote of Bem’s study:  “this isn’t proof of psi, far fr</p><p>6 0.102281 <a title="485-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-09-Varying_treatment_effects%2C_again.html">1310 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-09-Varying treatment effects, again</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On the basis of two papers and because it is completely obvious, we (meaning  me , Justin, and  John ) predict that Elena Kagan will get confirmed to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  But we also want to see how close we can come to predicting the votes for and against.
 
We actually have two sets of predictions, both using the MRP technique discussed previously on this blog.  The first is based on our  recent paper  in the  Journal of Politics  showing that support for the nominee in a senator’s home state plays a striking role in whether she or he votes to confirm the nominee.  The second is based on a  new working paper  extending “basic” MRP to show that senators respond far more to their co-partisans than the median voter in their home states.  Usually, our vote “predictions” do not differ much, but there is a group of senators who are predicted to vote yes for Kagan with a probability around 50% and the two sets of predictions thus differ for Kagan more than usual.</p><p>3 0.653395 <a title="485-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Doug_Hibbs_on_the_fundamentals_in_2010.html">292 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Doug Hibbs on the fundamentals in 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010. The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>4 0.63803428 <a title="485-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo%21.html">934 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Axelrod writes: 
  
  
Quantitative historian Allan Lichtman claims to have discovered 13 predictors that determine who will win the popular vote in presidential elections. He predicts Obama will win in 2012. Writing in his New York Times column, “538,” Nate Silver attempted a critique Lichtman’s prediction. Soon afterward Lichtman wrote a rejoinder. Evidently Lichtman has correctly and publicly predicted the popular vote winners in the last 7 presidential elections. I think he predicted Gore would win in 2000. He got the popular vote winner right, but not electoral college vote winner. Lichtman presents his methods in his early 1980s book, “The Keys to the White House.” Lichtman consulted with Volodia Keilis-Borok, and used a kernel discriminant analysis approach on election results from 1860-1980 as the training set. I think there is some argument as to scoring because Lichtman claims more than 7 successes. I guess he divided the data into a training and validation sets and w</p><p>5 0.63726467 <a title="485-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-10-Translating_into_Votes%3A_The_Electoral_Impact_of_Spanish-Language_Ballots.html">406 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-10-Translating into Votes: The Electoral Impact of Spanish-Language Ballots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Hopkins sends along  this article :
  
[Hopkins] uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the turnout and election impacts of Spanish-language assistance provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Analyses of two different data sets – the Latino National Survey and California 1998 primary election returns – show that Spanish-language assistance increased turnout for citizens who speak little English. The California results also demonstrate that election procedures an influence outcomes, as support for ending bilingual education dropped markedly in heavily Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with Spanish-language assistance. The California analyses find hints of backlash among non-Hispanic white precincts, but not with the same size or certainty. Small changes in election procedures can influence who votes as well as what wins.
  
Beyond the direct relevance of these results, I find this paper interesting as an example of research that is fundamentally quantitative.

I [Bueker] am analyzing the effect of various contextual factors on the voter turnout of naturalized Latino citizens.  I have included the natural log of the number of Spanish Language ads run in each state during the election cycle to predict voter turnout.  I now want to calculate the predicted probabilities of turnout for those in states with 0 ads, 500 ads, 1000 ads, etc.  The problem is that I do not know how to handle the beta coefficient of the LN(Spanish language ads).  Is there someway to “unlog” the coefficient?
  
My reply:  Calculate these probabilities for specific values of predictors, then graph the predictions of interest.  Also, you can average over the other inputs in your model to get summaries.  See  this article  with Pardoe for further discussion.</p><p>2 0.89840525 <a title="485-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-31-Infovis_vs._statistical_graphics%3A__My_talk_tomorrow_%28Tues%29_1pm_at_Columbia.html">546 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-31-Infovis vs. statistical graphics:  My talk tomorrow (Tues) 1pm at Columbia</a></p>

I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>5 0.84155852 <a title="485-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-04-Data_visualization_panel_at_the_New_York_Public_Library_this_evening%21.html">1246 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-04-Data visualization panel at the New York Public Library this evening!</a></p>

I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.

<p>Introduction: I recently had the occasion to reread  my review  of The Black Swan, from April 2007.
 
It was fun reading my review (and also  this pre-review ; “nothing useful escapes from a blackbody,” indeed).  It was like a greatest hits of all my pet ideas that I’ve never published.
 
Looking back, I realize that Taleb really was right about a lot of things.  Now that the financial crisis has happened, we tend to forget that the experts who Taleb bashes were  not  always reasonable at all.  Here’s what I wrote in my review, three and a half years ago:
  
On page 19, Taleb refers to the usual investment strategy (which I suppose I actually use myself) as “picking pennies in front of a steamroller.” That’s a cute phrase; did he come up with it? I’m also reminded of the famous Martingale betting system.

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

As I’ve written before (see  this post from 2008  reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and  this post from 2010  reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.

1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up. 
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride. 
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication.

<p>Introduction: In an article entitled 16 Weeks, Thomas Basbøll  ruthlessly  lays out the time constraints that limit what a student will be able to write during a semester and recommends that students follow a plan:
  
Try to be realistic. If you need time for “free writing” or “thought writing” (writing to find out what you think) book that into your calendar as well, but the important part of the challenge is to find time to write down what you already know needs to be written. If you don’t yet know what you’re going to say this semester, then your challenge is, in part, to figure that out. But you should still find at least 30 minutes a day to write down something you know you want to say. Keep in mind that we are only talking about sixteen weeks in the very near future. . . . Assuming that you do have something say, then, here’s the challenge: write always and only when (and what) your calendar tells you to. Don’t write when “inspired” to do so (unless this happens to coincide with your writing s</p><p>5 0.78413761 <a title="278-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Alfred_Kahn.html">487 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Alfred Kahn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Appointed “inflation czar” in late 1970s, Alfred Kahn is  most famous  for deregulating the airline industry.  At the time this seemed to make sense, although in retrospect I’m less a fan of consumer-driven policies than I used to be.  When I was a kid we subscribed to Consumer Reports and so I just assumed that everything that was good for the consumer–lower prices, better products, etc.–was a good thing.  Upon reflection, though, I think it’s a mistake to focus too narrowly on the interests of consumers.  For example (from  my Taleb review  a couple years ago):
  
The discussion on page 112 of how Ralph Nader saved lives (mostly via seat belts in cars) reminds me of his car-bumper campaign in the 1970s. My dad subscribed to Consumer Reports then (he still does, actually, and I think reads it for pleasure–it must be one of those Depression-mentality things), and at one point they were pushing heavily for the 5-mph bumpers. Apparently there was some federal regulation about how strong</p><p>6 0.78257781 <a title="278-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-12-Why_it_doesn%E2%80%99t_make_sense_to_chew_people_out_for_not_reading_the_help_page.html">955 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-12-Why it doesn’t make sense to chew people out for not reading the help page</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak points me to  this article  by the always-excellent Carl Bialik, slamming hypothesis tests.  I only wish Carl had talked with me before so hastily posting, though!  I would’ve argued with some of the things in the article.  In particular, he writes:
  
Reese and Brad Carlin . . . suggest that Bayesian statistics are a better alternative, because they tackle the probability that the hypothesis is true head-on, and incorporate prior knowledge about the variables involved.
  
Brad Carlin does great work in theory, methods, and applications, and I like the bit about the prior knowledge (although I might prefer the more general phrase “additional information”), but I hate that quote!  
 
My quick response is that the hypothesis of zero effect is almost never true!  The problem with the significance testing framework–Bayesian or otherwise–is in the obsession with the possibility of an exact zero effect.  The real concern is not with zero, it’s with claiming a positive effect whe</p><p>2 0.99143213 <a title="278-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-ARM_solutions.html">240 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>3 0.98992288 <a title="278-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-30-New_innovations_in_spam.html">545 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-30-New innovations in spam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email today:
  
Hello Andrew,


I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.


Sincerely, 
Samantha Rhodes

<p>Introduction: Dan Lakeland  asks :
  
When are statistical graphics potentially life threatening?  When they’re poorly designed, and used to make decisions on potentially life threatening topics, like medical decision making, engineering design, and the like.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has dropped the ball on communicating to physicians about infant jaundice.  Another message in this post is that bad decisions can compound each other.
  
It’s an interesting story (follow the link above for the details), would be great for a class in decision analysis or statistical communication.  I have no idea how to get from A to B here, in the sense of persuading hospitals to do this sort of thing better.  I’d guess the first step is to carefully lay out costs and benefits.  When doctors and nurses make extra precautions for safety, it could be useful to lay out the ultimate goals and estimate the potential costs and benefits of different approaches.</p><p>5 0.98631394 <a title="278-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-Ethics_and_statistics_in_development_research.html">241 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-Ethics and statistics in development research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.
 
P.S.  Overall the article is pretty good.

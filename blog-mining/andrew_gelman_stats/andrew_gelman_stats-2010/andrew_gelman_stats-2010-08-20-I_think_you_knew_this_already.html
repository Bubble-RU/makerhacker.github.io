<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus  writes ,
  
An algorithm that is good at chess won’t help parsing sentences, and one that parses sentences likely won’t be much help playing chess.
  
That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.  I’d much rather have had twice as much detail on the first part of the life and then had the post-1972 era compr</p><p>3 0.19594865 <a title="218-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-16-Chess_vs._checkers.html">615 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-16-Chess vs. checkers</a></p>

Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces.

It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?


Part of the problem is that we learn the game as children so we tend to think of it as a children’s game.

<p>Introduction: In honor of the  Olympics , I got my butt over to the park and played run-around-the-house chess for the first time ever.
 
As was discussed in the comments thread  awhile ago , there seem to be three possible ways to play Turing chess:
 
1.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return.  Once you sit down to the table, the other player runs around the house.  Then you have to move, etc.  You lose if you are checkmated or if you fail to move before your opponent returns to his chair.
 
2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.
 
3.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs.  When you return, yo</p><p>5 0.16231567 <a title="218-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-25-Diving_chess.html">1638 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-25-Diving chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Knowing of my interest in  Turing run-around-the-house chess , David Lockhart points me to  this :
  
Diving Chess is a chess variant, which is played in a swimming pool. Instead of using chess clocks, each player must submerge themselves underwater during their turn, only to resurface when they are ready to make a move. Players must make a move within 5 seconds of resurfacing (they will receive a warning if not, and three warnings will result in a forfeit). Diving Chess was invented by American Chess Master Etan Ilfeld; the very first exhibition game took place between Ilfeld and former British Chess Champion William Hartston at the Thirdspace gym in Soho on August 2nd, 2011. Hartston won the match which lasted almost two hours such that each player was underwater for an entire hour.</p><p>6 0.13785729 <a title="218-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-Math_Talks_%3A%3A_Action_Movies.html">1617 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-Math Talks :: Action Movies</a></p>

The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>same-blog 2 0.81799567 <a title="218-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-20-I_think_you_knew_this_already.html">218 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-20-I think you knew this already</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>3 0.80662405 <a title="218-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-27-No_radon_lobby.html">238 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-27-No radon lobby</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser writes  thoughtfully  about the costs, benefits, and incentives for different policy recommendation options regarding a recent water crisis.  Good stuff:  it’s solid “freakonomics”–and I mean this in positive way:  a mix of economic and statistical analysis, with assumptions stated clearly.  Kaiser writes: 
  
Using the framework from Chapter 4, we should think about the incentives facing the Mass. Water Resources Authority:


A false positive error (people asked to throw out water when water is clean) means people stop drinking tap water temporarily, perhaps switching to bottled water, and the officials claim victory when no one falls sick, and businesses that produce bottled water experience a jump in sales. It is also very difficult to prove a “false positive” when people have stopped drinking the water. So this type of error is easy to hide behind.


A false negative error (people told it’s safe to drink water when water is polluted) becomes apparent when someone falls sick</p><p>4 0.80018318 <a title="218-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Wanted%3A__Probability_distributions_for_rank_orderings.html">151 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Wanted:  Probability distributions for rank orderings</a></p>

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.  In political science, the usual way to start is</p><p>5 0.79642189 <a title="218-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-Going_negative.html">1918 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-Going negative</a></p>

I have measured total phosphorus, TP, on a number of dialysis patients, and also measured conventional phosphate, Pi. Now P is exchanged with the environment as Pi, so in principle a correlation between TP and Pi could perhaps be expected. I’m really most interested in the fraction of TP which is not Pi, that is TP-Pi. I would also expect that to be positively correlated with Pi. However, looking at the data using a mixed model an insignificant negative correlation is obtained. Then I thought, that since TP-Pi is bound to be small if Pi is large a negative correlation is almost dictated by the math even if the biology would have it otherwise in so far as the the TP-Pi, likely organic P, must someday have been Pi. Hence I thought about correcting the slight negative correlation between TP-Pi and Pi for the expected large negative correlation due to the math – to eventually recover what I came from: a positive correlation. People seems to agree that this thinki</p><p>6 0.79009038 <a title="218-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-24-Measurement_error_in_monkey_studies.html">1997 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-24-Measurement error in monkey studies</a></p>

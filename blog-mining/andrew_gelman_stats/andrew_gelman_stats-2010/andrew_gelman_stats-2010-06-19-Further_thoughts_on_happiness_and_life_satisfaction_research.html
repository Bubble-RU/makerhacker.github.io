<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>4 0.2046994 <a title="98-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-11-The_happiness_gene%3A__My_bottom_line_%28for_now%29.html">706 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-11-The happiness gene:  My bottom line (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a couple of email exchanges with Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and James Fowler, two of the authors of the article on the gene that is associated with life satisfaction which we  blogged  the other day.  (Bruno Frey, the third author of the article in question, is out of town according to his email.)  Fowler also commented  directly  on the blog.
 
I won’t go through all the details, but now I have a better sense of what’s going on.  (Thanks, Jan and James!)  Here’s my current understanding:
 
 1.   The original manuscript was divided into two parts:   an article  by De Neve alone published in the Journal of Human Genetics, and  an article  by De Neve, Fowler, Frey, and Nicholas Christakis submitted to Econometrica.  The latter paper repeats the analysis from the Adolescent Health survey and also replicates with data from the Framingham heart study (hence Christakis’s involvement).
 
The Framingham study measures a slightly different gene and uses a slightly life-satisfaction question com</p><p>5 0.19771859 <a title="98-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-Economists_don%E2%80%99t_think_like_accountants%E2%80%94but_maybe_they_should.html">922 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-Economists don’t think like accountants—but maybe they should</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joseph Delaney  quotes Frances Woolley:
  
In other words, the reason we care about inequality is that it reduces the happiness achievable from a given amount of income. How much depends upon the happiness/income relationship. Does the marginal utility of income fall rapidly? Or is the happiness from the 100,000th dollar almost as great as the happiness from the 100th?
  
Delaney goes on to discuss the marginal utility of income, but I have a different point to make.
 
Woolley is a professor of economics.
 
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions.  A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.
 
This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics.  Or maybe the better analogy</p><p>6 0.18082082 <a title="98-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-Happy_news_on_happiness%3B_what_can_we_believe%3F.html">1305 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-Happy news on happiness; what can we believe?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Kyle Peyton writes:
  
I’m passing you this  recent  news article by Ewen Callaway in the hope that you will make a comment about the methodology on your blog.  It’s generated some  back and forth  between the economics and science communities.


I [Peyton] am very sceptical of the reductive approach taken by the economics profession generally, and the normative implications this kind of research generates. For example, p. 7 of the  working paper  states: “…[according to our model] decreasing the diversity of the most diverse country in the sample (Ethopia) by 1 percentage point would raise its income per capita by 21 percent”. Understandably, this piece is couched in assumptions that would take hours to pick apart, but their discussion of the approach belies the uncertainty involved. The main response by the authors in defense is that genetic diversity is a ‘proxy variable’. This is a common assertion, but I find it really infuriating.

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship.

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>6 0.77337605 <a title="98-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-Happy_news_on_happiness%3B_what_can_we_believe%3F.html">1305 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-Happy news on happiness; what can we believe?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.  Yes, there is less turnover th</p><p>4 0.9619413 <a title="98-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Forensic_bioinformatics%2C_or%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_believe_everything_you_read_in_the_%28scientific%29_papers.html">360 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Forensic bioinformatics, or, Don’t believe everything you read in the (scientific) papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.

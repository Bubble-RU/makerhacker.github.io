<p>Introduction: Joe Northrup writes:
  
I have a question about correcting for multiple comparisons in a Bayesian regression model. I believe I understand the argument in  your 2012 paper  in Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness that when you have a hierarchical model there is shrinkage of estimates towards the group-level mean and thus there is no need to add any additional penalty to correct for multiple comparisons. In my case I do not have hierarchically structured dataâ&euro;&rdquo;i.e. I have only 1 observation per group but have a categorical variable with a large number of categories. Thus, I am fitting a simple multiple regression in a Bayesian framework. Would putting a strong, mean 0, multivariate normal prior on the betas in this model accomplish the same sort of shrinkage (it seems to me that it would) and do you believe this is a valid way to address criticism of multiple comparisons in this setting?

<p>Introduction: Christian Robert is  planning  a graduate seminar in which students read 15 classic articles of statistics.  (See  here  for more details and a slightly different list.)
 
Actually, he just writes “classics,” but based on his list, I assume he only wants articles, not books.  If he wanted to include classic books, I’d nominate the following, just for starters: 
- Fisher’s Statistical Methods for Research Workers 
- Snedecor and Cochran’s Statistical Methods 
- Kish’s Survey Sampling 
- Box, Hunter, and Hunter’s Statistics for Experimenters 
- Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Cleveland’s The Elements of Graphing Data 
- Mosteller and Wallace’s book on the Federalist Papers. 
Probably Cox and Hinkley, too.  That’s a book that I don’t think has aged well, but it seems to have had a big influence.

Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.  I commented as follows:

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>6 0.71097344 <a title="128-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-15-A_statistical_research_project%3A__Weeding_out_the_fraudulent_citations.html">1321 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-15-A statistical research project:  Weeding out the fraudulent citations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here’s some psychology research that’s relevant to  yesterday’s discussion  on working-class voting.  In  a paper  to appear in the journal  Cognitive Science , Andrei Cimpian, Amanda Brandone, and Susan Gelman write:
  
Generic statements (e.g., “Birds lay eggs”) express generalizations about categories. In this paper, we hypothesized that there is a paradoxical asymmetry at the core of generic meaning, such that these sentences have extremely strong implications but require little evidence to be judged true. Four experiments confirmed the hypothesized asymmetry: Participants interpreted novel generics such as “Lorches have purple feathers” as referring to nearly all lorches, but they judged the same novel generics to be true given a wide range of prevalence levels (e.g., even when only 10% or 30% of lorches had purple feathers). A second hypothesis, also confirmed by the results, was that novel generic sentences about dangerous or distinctive properties would be more acceptable than</p><p>2 0.96830982 <a title="128-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-28-Cool_job_opening_with_brilliant_researchers_at_Yahoo.html">978 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-28-Cool job opening with brilliant researchers at Yahoo</a></p>

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>3 0.96323842 <a title="128-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-04-Cool_one-day_miniconference_at_Columbia_Fri_12_Oct_on_computational_and_online_social_science.html">1481 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-04-Cool one-day miniconference at Columbia Fri 12 Oct on computational and online social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing we do here at the Applied Statistics Center is hold mini-conferences.  The next one looks really cool.  It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods. Together these advances have created an unprecedented opportunity to address longstanding questions in the social sciences, rang</p><p>4 0.96293741 <a title="128-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-29-Roth_and_Amsterdam.html">57 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-29-Roth and Amsterdam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I used to think that fiction is about making up stories, but in recent years I’ve decided that fiction is really more of a method of telling true stories.  One thing fiction allows you to do is explore what-if scenarios.  I recently read two books that made me think about this:  The Counterlife by Philip Roth and Things We Didn’t See Coming by Steven Amsterdam.  Both books are explicitly about contingencies and possibilities:  Roth’s tells a sequence of related but contradictory stories involving his Philip Roth-like (of course) protagonist, and Amsterdam’s is based on an alternative present/future.  (I picture Amsterdam’s book as being set in Australia, but maybe I’m just imagining this based on my knowledge that the book was written and published in that country.)  I found both books fascinating, partly because of the characters’ voices but especially because they both seemed to exemplify George Box’s dictum that to understand a system you have to perturb it.
 
So, yes, literature an</p><p>5 0.96072185 <a title="128-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram_on_Mandelbrot.html">1784 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram on Mandelbrot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: I was invited by the Columbia University residence halls to speak at an event on gay marriage.  (I’ve assisted my colleagues Jeff Lax and Justin Phillips in their research on the topic.)  The event sounded fun–unfortunately I’ll be out of town that weekend so can’t make it–but it got me thinking about how gay marriage and other social issues are so relaxing to think about because there’s no need for doubt.
 
About half of Americans support same-sex marriage and about half oppose it.  And the funny thing is, you can be absolutely certain in your conviction, from either direction.  If you support, it’s a simple matter of human rights, and it’s a bit ridiculous to suppose that if gay marriage is allowed, it will somehow wreck all the straight marriages out there.  Conversely, you can oppose on the clear rationale of wanting to keep marriage the same as it’s always been, and suggest that same-sex couples can be free to get together outside of marriage, as they always could.

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . .

<p>Introduction: Adrien Friggeri has a lovely  visualization  of US Senators movement between clusters:
 
   
 
You have to click the image and play with it to appreciate it. The methodology isn’t yet published – but I can see how this could be very illuminating. The dynamic clustering aspect hasn’t been researched much – one of the notable pieces is the Blei and Lafferty  dynamic topic model of Science .
 
I did a static  analysis of the US Senate  back in 2005 with Wray Buntine and coauthors. Some additional visualizations and the source code are  here . We did a dynamic analysis of US Supreme Court on  this blog  but there’s also a  paper . 
 
My knowledge on this topic is out of date, however. Who has been doing good work in this area? I’ll organize the links.

<p>Introduction: My short answer (based on the research of Leighley and Nagler):
  
Whether or not mandatory voting is a good idea, I think it’s unlikely to happen at a national level. Even setting aside the practical difficulties of taking a now-voluntary action and making it compulsory, bringing in the other half of the potential electorate would change the political conversation so much that it’s hard for me to see current officeholders supporting such a plan.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  wrote  that Mickey Kaus was right to point out that it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.” As Kaus points out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.  The slogan is particularly silly for Tip O’Neill himself.  Sure, O’Neill had to have a firm grip on local politics to get his safe seat in the first place, but after that it was smooth sailing.
 
Jonathan Bernstein  disagrees , writing:
  
 
Yes, but: don’t most Members of the House have ironclad partisan districts?  And isn’t the most important single thing they can do to protect themselves involve having pull in state politics to avoid being gerrymandered?  That is “all politics is local,” no? 


There’s also a fair amount they can do to stay on the good side of their local party, thus avoiding a primary fight.  And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>4 0.59214944 <a title="224-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-Laws_as_expressive.html">1085 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-Laws as expressive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: June Carbone  points out  sometimes people want laws to express a sentiment.  This isn’t just about Congress passing National Smoked Meats Week or San Francisco establishing itself as a nuclear-free zone, it also includes things such as laws against gay marriage, where, as Carbone writes, “we ‘care too much,’ when in fact we can do so little.”
 
I don’t have anything to add here, and I expect many of you are familiar with this idea, but it’s new to me.  I’d always been puzzled by people who want to use the law to express a sentiment, but perhaps it makes sense to be open-minded and to consider this as one of the purposes of the legislative process.</p><p>5 0.58345562 <a title="224-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-12-Human_nature_can%E2%80%99t_be_changed_%28except_when_it_can%29.html">707 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-12-Human nature can’t be changed (except when it can)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff, Justin, and I  write :
  
Gay marriage is not going away as a highly emotional, contested issue. Proposition 8, the California ballot measure that bans same-sex marriage, has seen to that, as it winds its way through the federal courts.  But perhaps the public has reached a turning point.
  
And check out the (mildly) dynamic graphics.

<p>Introduction: Frank Wood and Nick Bartlett  write :
  
Deplump works the same as all probabilistic lossless compressors. A datastream is fed one observation at a time into a predictor which emits both the data stream and predictions about what the next observation in the stream should be for every observation. An encoder takes this output and produces a compressed stream which can be piped over a network or to a file. A receiver then takes this stream and decompresses it by doing everything in reverse. In order to ensure that the decoder has the same information available to it that the encoder had when compressing the stream, the decoded datastream is both emitted and directed to another predictor. This second predictor’s job is to produce exactly the same predictions as the initial predictor so that the decoder has the same information at every step of the process as the encoder did.


The difference between probabilistic lossless compressors is in the prediction engine, encoding and decoding bein</p><p>3 0.80688274 <a title="224-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-20-A_Gapminder-like_data_visualization_package.html">422 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-20-A Gapminder-like data visualization package</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This one  was so beautiful I just had to repost it:
 
From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>3 0.13957703 <a title="340-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-02-Experimental_reasoning_in_social_science.html">785 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-02-Experimental reasoning in social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>4 0.1393574 <a title="340-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-New_journal_on_causal_inference.html">879 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-New journal on causal inference</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning

Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.
  
The  article  follows with crisp discussions of each point.

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>4 0.91580772 <a title="340-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-It_depends_upon_what_the_meaning_of_the_word_%E2%80%9Cfirm%E2%80%9D_is..html">940 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-It depends upon what the meaning of the word “firm” is.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.90545934 <a title="340-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-13-Randomized_experiments%2C_non-randomized_experiments%2C_and_observational_studies.html">340 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-13-Randomized experiments, non-randomized experiments, and observational studies</a></p>

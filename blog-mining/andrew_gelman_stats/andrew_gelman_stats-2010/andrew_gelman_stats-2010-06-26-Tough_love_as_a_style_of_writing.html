<p>Introduction: Having been annoyed for  awhile  at those in-your-face internet gurus such as Seth Godin, Clay Shirky, Philip Greenspun, Jeff Jarvis, I was happy to come across  this bit  of Godin-bashing from Tom Slee.  I’m sure Godin has some valuable insights, but I hate that in-your-face style, and I’m glad to see someone go to the trouble of pointing out all the nonsensical bits.</p><p>3 0.25773898 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-30-Seth_Roberts.html">2313 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-30-Seth Roberts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I met Seth back in the early 1990s when we were both professors at the University of California.  He sometimes came to the statistics department seminar and we got to talking about various things; in particular we shared an interest in statistical graphics.  Much of my work in this direction eventually went toward the use of graphical displays to understand fitted models.  Seth went in another direction and got interested in the role of exploratory data analysis in science, the idea that we could use graphs not just to test or even understand a model but also as the source of new hypotheses.  We continued to discuss these issues over the years;  see here , for example.
 
At some point when we were at Berkeley the administration was encouraging the faculty to teach freshman seminars, and I had the idea of teaching a course on left-handedness.  I’d just read the book by Stanley Coren and thought it would be fun to go through it with a class, chapter by chapter.  But my knowledge of psych</p><p>4 0.1818902 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-02-Selection_bias%2C_or%2C_How_you_can_think_the_experts_don%E2%80%99t_check_their_models%2C_if_you_simply_don%E2%80%99t_look_at_what_the_experts_actually_are_doing.html">1295 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-02-Selection bias, or, How you can think the experts don’t check their models, if you simply don’t look at what the experts actually are doing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: I was thinking a bit more about  Jonathan Rauch’s lament  about the fading of  the buggy-whip industry  print journalism, in which he mocks bloggers, analogizes blogging to scribbling with spray paint on the side of a building, and writes that the blogosphere is “the single worst medium for sustained, and therefore grown-up, reading and writing and argumentation ever invented.”
 
Yup.  Worse than talk radio.  Worse than cave painting.  Worse than smoke signals, rock ‘n’ roll lyrics, woodcuts, spray-paint graffiti, and every other medium of communication ever invented.
 
OK, he didn’t really mean it.  Rauch actually has an ironclad argument here.  He’s claiming, in a blog, that blogging is crap.  Therefore, if he fills his blog with unsupported exaggerations, that’s fine, as he’s demonstrating that blogging is . . . crap.

<p>Introduction: I was reading a book of Alfred Kazin’s letters—I don’t know if they’d be so interesting to someone who hadn’t already read a bunch of his  stuff , but I found them pretty interesting—and came across this amazing bit, dated August 11, 1957:
 
 
 
No, really, Al.  Tell us what you really feel.  This was in his private diary, so I can’t really criticize him for it.  And all of us have private thoughts, sometimes publicly expressed, that are unworthy of our better self.  For example, once I was crossing a street and a taxi driver came dangerously close, and I screamed at him, “Go back to your own country, you #&@#%*^&.”  So I’m not claiming that I’m any better than Kazin.  I just thought that quote was pretty amazing.  I guess that’s how (some) people thought, back in the fifties.
 
Also interesting that he wrote “ass-hole” in that context.  The hyphen surprised me, also I don’t think people would use that word in this way anymore.  Nowadays I think of an asshole as a person, not a place.</p><p>4 0.78647298 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-24-Blogs_vs._real_journalism.html">868 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-24-Blogs vs. real journalism</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to an interview with Seth Godin, who makes some commonplace but useful observations on jobs and careers.  It’s fine, but whenever I read this sort of thing, I get annoyed by the super-aggressive writing style.  These internet guys–Seth Godin, Clay Shirky, Philip Greenspun, Jeff Jarvis, and so on–are always getting in your face, telling you how everything you thought was true was wrong.  Some of the things these guys say are just silly (for example, Godin’s  implication  that Bob Dylan is more of a success than the Monkees because Dylan sells more tickets), other times they have interesting insights, but reading any of them for awhile just sets me on edge.  I can’t take being shouted at, and I get a little tired of hearing over and over again that various people, industries, etc., are dinosaurs.
 
Where does this aggressive style come from?  My guess is that it’s coming from the vast supply of “business books” out there.  These are books that are supposed to grab yo</p><p>2 0.8417502 <a title="111-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-23-In_which_I_disagree_with_John_Maynard_Keynes.html">1775 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-23-In which I disagree with John Maynard Keynes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his  review  in 1938 of  Historical Development of the Graphical Representation of Statistical Data , by H. Gray Funkhauser, for  The Economic Journal , the great economist writes:
  
Perhaps the most striking outcome of Mr. Funkhouser’s researches is the fact of the very slow progress which graphical methods made until quite recently. . . . In the first fifty volumes of the Statistical Journal, 1837-87, only fourteen graphs are printed altogether. It is surprising to be told that Laplace never drew a graph of the normal law of error . . . Edgeworth made no use of statistical charts as distinct from mathematical diagrams.


Apart from Quetelet and Jevons, the most important influences were probably those of Galton and of Mulhall’s Dictionary, first published in 1884. Galton was indeed following his father and grandfather in this field, but his pioneer work was mainly restricted to meteorological maps, and he did not contribute to the development of the graphical representation of ec</p><p>3 0.83808267 <a title="111-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-18-The_estimated_effect_size_is_implausibly_large.__Under_what_models_is_this_a_piece_of_evidence_that_the_true_effect_is_small%3F.html">808 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-18-The estimated effect size is implausibly large.  Under what models is this a piece of evidence that the true effect is small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this? I think i</p><p>4 0.83171546 <a title="111-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-21-Going_viral_%E2%80%94_not%21.html">864 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-21-Going viral — not!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>5 0.82943255 <a title="111-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-17-Stan_and_RStan_1.1.0.html">1627 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-17-Stan and RStan 1.1.0</a></p>

I [Ziliak] am sorry to share this sad news about Arnold Zellner (AEA Distinguished Fellow, 2002, ASA President, 1991, ISBA co-founding president, all around genius and sweet fellow), who died yesterday morning (August 11, 2010).   He was a truly great statistician and to me and to many others a generous and wonderful friend, colleague, and hero.  I will miss him.


His cancer was spreading everywhere though you wouldn’t know it as his energy level was Arnold’s typical: abnormally high.  But then he had a stroke just a few days after an unsuccessful surgery “to help with breathing” the doctor said, and the combination of events weakened him terribly.  He was vibrant through June and much of July, and maintained an 8 hour work day at the office.  He never lost his sense of humor nor his joy of life.  He died at home in hospice care and fortunately he did not suffer long.

</p><p>9 We are fortunate to have had someone as remarkable both professionally and personally as Arnold be a member of our community for so many years. [sent-17, score-0.117]
</p><p>10 To a statistician such as myself, econometrics seems to have two different, nearly opposing, personalities. [sent-21, score-0.194]
</p><p>11 On one side, econometrics is the study of physics-like laws–supply and demand, utility theory, simultaneous equation models, all sorts of attempts to capture economic behavior with mathematical laws. [sent-22, score-0.251]
</p><p>12 More recently, some of this focus has moved to agent-based modeling, but it’s still the same basic idea to me:  serious mathematical modeling. [sent-23, score-0.121]
</p><p>13 But there’s another side to economics, a side that I think has become much more prominent, and that’s the anti-modeling approach, the distribution-free methods that try to assume as little as possible (replacing distributional assumptions by second-order stationarity, etc. [sent-25, score-0.266]
</p><p>14 To the extent that economics is a model-centered field, I think it’s naturally Bayesian, and Zellner’s methods fit in well. [sent-27, score-0.165]
</p><p>15 To the extent that economists are interested in robust, non-model-based population inference, I think Bayesian methods are also important–nonparametric methods get complicated quickly, and Bayesian inference is a good way to structure that complexity. [sent-28, score-0.275]
</p><p>16 Unfortunately, Bayesian methods have a bad name in some quarters of econometrics because they are associated with subjectivity, which goes against both mainstream threads in econometrics. [sent-29, score-0.357]

Is there any literature on the Bayesian approach to simultaneous equation systems that you could suggest? (Think demand/supply in econ).

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: My paper with Christian Robert,  “Not Only Defended But Also Applied”: The Perceived Absurdity of Bayesian Inference , was recently published in The American Statistician, along with discussions by Steve Fienberg, Steve Stigler, Deborah Mayo, and Wesley Johnson, and our rejoinder,  The Anti-Bayesian Moment and Its Passing .
 
These articles revolved around the question of why the great probabilist William Feller, in his classic book on probability (“Feller, Volume 1,” as it is known), was so intemperately anti-Bayesian.  We located Feller’s attitude within a post-WW2 “anti-Bayesian moment” in which Bayesian inference was perceived as a threat to the dominance of non-Bayesian methods, which were mature enough to have solved problems yet new enough to still appear to have limitless promise.

<p>Introduction: David Blackwell was already retired by the time I came to Berkeley, and probably our closest connection was that I taught the class in decision theory that he used to teach.  I enjoyed that class a lot, partly because it took me out of my usual comfort zone of statistical inference and data analysis toward something more theoretical and mathematical.  Blackwell was one of the legendary figures in the department at that time and was also one of the most tolerant of alternative approaches to statistics, perhaps because of combination of a mathematical background, applied research in the war and after (which I learned about in  this recent obituary ), and personal experiences,
 
Blackwell may be best known in statistics for the  Rao-Blackwell theorem .  Rao, of course, is also famoust for the Cramer-Rao lower bound.  Both theorems relate to minimum-variance statistical estimators.

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
Eric Archer forwarded  this document  by Nick Freemantle, “The Reverend Bayes—was he really a prophet?”, in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine:

 

Does [Bayes's] contribution merit the enthusiasms of his followers? Or is his legacy overhyped? . . .


First, Bayesians appear to have an absolute right to disapprove of any conventional approach in statistics without offering a workable alternative—for example, a colleague recently stated at a meeting that ‘. . . it is OK to have multiple comparisons because Bayesians’ don’t believe in alpha spending’. . . .


Second, Bayesians appear to build an army of straw men—everything it seems is different and better from a Bayesian perspective, although many of the concepts seem remarkably familiar. For example, a very well known Bayesian statistician recently surprised the audience with his discovery of the P value as a useful Bayesian statistic at a meeting in Birmingham.


Third, Bayesians possess enormous enthusiasm fo</p><p>5 0.79457146 <a title="205-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-25-Ways_of_knowing.html">1469 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-25-Ways of knowing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>2 0.97624397 <a title="205-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-21-If_a_lottery_is_encouraging_addictive_gambling%2C_don%E2%80%99t_expand_it%21.html">1731 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-21-If a lottery is encouraging addictive gambling, don’t expand it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: These  (from Shaun Usher) are surprisingly good, especially since he appears to come up with new lists and letters pretty regularly.  I suppose a lot of them get sent in from readers, but still.
 
Here’s my favorite recent item, a  letter  sent to the Seattle Bureau of Prohibition in 1931:
  
Dear Sir:


My husband is in the habit of buying a quart of wiskey every other day from a Chinese bootlegger named Chin Waugh living at 317-16th near Alder street.


We need this money for household expenses. Will you please have his place raided? He keeps a supply planted in the garden and a smaller quantity under the back steps for quick delivery. If you make the raid at 9:30 any morning you will be sure to get the goods and Chin also as he leaves the house at 10 o’clock and may clean up before he goes.


Thanking you in advance, 


I remain 
yours truly,


Mrs. Hillyer</p><p>4 0.96588898 <a title="205-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-There_are_never_70_distinct_parameters.html">327 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-There are never 70 distinct parameters</a></p>

I’m a graduate student in computational biology, and I’m relatively new to advanced statistics, and am trying to teach myself how best to approach a problem I have.


My dataset is a small sparse matrix of 150 cases and 70 predictors, it is sparse as in many zeros, not many ‘NA’s.  Each case is a nutrient that is fed into an in silico organism, and its response is whether or not it stimulates growth, and each predictor is one of 70 different pathways that the nutrient may or may not belong to.  Because all of the nutrients do not belong to all of the pathways, there are thus many zeros in my matrix.  My goal is to be able to use the pathways themselves to predict whether or not a nutrient could stimulate growth, thus I wanted to compute regression coefficients for each pathway, with which I could apply to other nutrients for other species.


There are quite a few singularities in the dataset (summary(glm) reports that 14 coefficients are not defined because of sin</p><p>5 0.96337336 <a title="205-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-22-Going_Beyond_the_Book%3A_Towards_Critical_Reading_in_Statistics_Teaching.html">1023 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-22-Going Beyond the Book: Towards Critical Reading in Statistics Teaching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.95415759 <a title="205-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-13-Arnold_Zellner.html">205 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-13-Arnold Zellner</a></p>

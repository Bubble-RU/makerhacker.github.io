<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school.

<p>Introduction: I read the excerpt in n+1.  As one would expect of DeWitt, it was great, while being nothing at all like her  other  book.  THe new book reminded me a bit of Philip K. Dick.  Here’s a brief excerpt (which is not actually particularly PKD-like) of the main character talking to himself:
  
“I don’t have what it takes,” he said.  He had never said it before because saying it would be like admitting he couldn’t make the grade.
  
I’m not pulling out this quote to sell you on the book.  The lines just struck me because of the exquisite distinctions, the idea that “don’t have what it takes” is somehow different than “couldn’t make the grade,” the idea that this character, who expresses his thoughts in empty phrases, ends up assigning to these phrases a set of precise meanings that make sense only to him.
 
One reason Lightning Rods was so fun and refreshing to read is that it’s a non-formula novel that, unlike ChabonFranzenLethemBakerEtc—and, for that matter, unlike Virginia Woolf—is about c</p><p>4 0.10282746 <a title="285-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-30-Why_is_George_Apley_overrated%3F.html">119 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-30-Why is George Apley overrated?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  comment  by Mark Palko reminded me that, while I’m a huge  Marquand  fan, I think The Late George Apley is way overrated.  My theory is that Marquand’s best books don’t fit into the modernist way of looking about literature, and that the gatekeepers of the 1930s and 1940s, when judging Marquand by these standards, conveniently labeled Apley has his best book because it had a form–Edith-Wharton-style satire–that they could handle.  In contrast, Point of No Return and all the other classics are a mixture of seriousness and satire that left critics uneasy.

<p>Introduction: I was stunned  this  from Jenny Davidson about mystery writers:
  
The crime fiction community is smart and adult and welcoming, and so many good books are being written (Lee Child was mentioning his peer group – i.e. they were the new kids around the same tie – being Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman – the list speaks for itself) . . .
  
Why was I stunned?  Because just a few days earlier I had a look at a book by Robert Crais.  It just happened that Phil, when he was visiting, had finished this book (which he described as “pretty good”) and left it with me so he wouldn’t have to take it back with him.  I’d never heard of Crais, but it had pretty amazing blurbs on the cover and Phil recommended it, so I took a look.
 
It was bad.  From page 1 it was bad.  It was like a bad cop show.  I could see the seams where the sentences were stitched together.  I could see how  somebody  might like this sort of book, but I certainly can’t understand the blurbs or the i</p><p>3 0.88090545 <a title="285-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-27-The_M%C3%B6bius_strip%2C_or%2C_marketing_that_is_impervious_to_criticism.html">1641 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-27-The Möbius strip, or, marketing that is impervious to criticism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Johnny Carson had this great trick where, after a joke bombed, he’d do such a good double-take that he’d end up getting a huge laugh.  This gimmick could never have worked as his sole shtick—at some point, Johnny had to tell some good jokes—but it was a reliable way to limit the downside.  For the purpose of our discussion here, the point is that, even when the joke failed, Carson had a way out.
 
I thought of this today after following a link from a commenter that led to  this blog  on publicity-minded author Tim Ferriss.  I’ve never read anything by Ferriss but I’ve read about him on occasion:  his gimmick is he promotes his book using ingenious marketing strategies.  Sort of like how Madonna is famous for being famous, and Paris Hilton is famous for being famous for being famous, Ferriss is famous for self-promotion.

<p>Introduction: This is my last entry derived from  Anthony Burgess’s book reviews , and it’ll be short.  His review of Angus Wilson’s “The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling:  His Life and Works” is a wonderfully balanced little thing.  Nothing incredibly deep–like most items in the collection, the review is only two pages long–but I give it credit for being a rare piece of Kipling criticism I’ve seen that (a) seriously engages with the politics, without (b) congratulating itself on bravely going against the fashions of the politically incorrect chattering classes by celebrating Kipling’s magnificent achievement blah blah blah.  Instead, Burgess shows respect for Kipling’s work and puts it in historical, biographical, and literary context.
 
Burgess concludes that Wilson’s book “reminds us, in John Gross’s words, that Kipling ‘remains a haunting, unsettling presence, with whom we still have to come to terms.’  Still.”  Well put, and generous of Burgess to end his review with another’s quote.

<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”
  
This sounds fascinating.  But I’m skeptical about this part:

Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000.

<p>Introduction: Wegman:  “It’s not reprinted 100 percent like you had it.”
 
Wikipedia guy:  “No, you added another paragraph at the end and you changed the headline. . . . You even copied the typos that I’ve corrected on my website.  It was taken verbatim and reprinted in your paper.”
 
The original author got a  check  for $500 but, unfortunately, no free subscription to “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics” (a $1400-$2800  value ).
 
P.S.  To those who think I’m being mean to Wegman:  I haven’t yet heard that he’s apologized to the people whose work he copied without attribution, or to the people who spent their time tracking all this down, or to the U.S. Congress for misrepresenting his expertise in his official report.
 
Everyone makes mistakes, and just about everyone has ethical lapses at times.  But when you get caught you’re supposed to make apology and restitution.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.91387165 <a title="285-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-18-Fiction_is_not_for_tirades%3F__Tell_that_to_Saul_Bellow%21.html">285 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-18-Fiction is not for tirades?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .


But if Freedom is middlebrow, it is so in the sacrosanct Don DeLillo tradition, which our critical establishment considers central to literature today. . . .

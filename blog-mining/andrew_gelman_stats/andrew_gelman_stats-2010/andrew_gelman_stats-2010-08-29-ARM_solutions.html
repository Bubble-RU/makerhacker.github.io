<p>Introduction: A friend writes to me:
  
You will be amused to know that students in our Bayesian Inference paper at 4th year found solutions to exercises from your book on-line.  The amazing thing was that some of them were dumb enough to copy out solutions verbatim.   However, I thought you might like to know you have done well in this class!
  
Iâ&euro;&trade;m happy to hear this.  I worked hard on those solutions!</p><p>3 0.25038779 <a title="240-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-19-Updated_solutions_to_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_homeworks.html">42 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-19-Updated solutions to Bayesian Data Analysis homeworks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are  solutions to about 50 of the exercises from Bayesian Data Analysis.  The solutions themselves haven’t been updated; I just cleaned up the file:  some change in Latex had resulted in much of the computer code running off the page, so I went in and cleaned up the files.
 
I wrote most of these in 1996, and I like them a lot.  I think several of them would’ve made good journal articles, and in retrospect I wish I’d published them as such.  Original material that appears first in a book (or, even worse, in homework solutions) can easily be overlooked.</p><p>4 0.24600738 <a title="240-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-19-Sorry%2C_no_ARM_solutions.html">1220 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-19-Sorry, no ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Gerlanc asks:
  
I’ve been reading your Regression and Multilevel Modeling book. Do you have a set of example solutions for the problems in the book?
  
Henning Piezunka, Adam Lynton, and others have asked the same question.
 
My universal response:
 
I’m glad you like our book.  Unfortunately, we have no solution sets.  I made a bunch of solutions for my earlier book but it was so much work that I decided not to do it a second time!</p><p>5 0.14746392 <a title="240-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-22-Krugman_sets_the_bar_too_high.html">1733 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-22-Krugman sets the bar too high</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

<p>Introduction: Our apartment is from earlier in the century, so I can’t give Tyler Cowen’s  first answer , but, after that, I follow him in thinking of the several books I have from that decade.  Beyond that, lemme think . . . We occasionally play  Risk , and our set dates from the 50s.  Some kitchen implements (a mixmaster, a couple of cookbooks, who knows which old bowls, forks, etc).  Probably some of the furniture, although I don’t know which.  Probably some of the items in our building (the boiler?)  What else, I wonder?  There are probably a few things I’m forgetting.
 
50-60 years is a long time, I guess.
 
P.S. to the commenters:  I’m taking the question to refer to things manufactured  in  the 1950s and not before!</p><p>4 0.73048031 <a title="240-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-Bayes_in_China_update.html">517 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-Bayes in China update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>5 0.72594786 <a title="240-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-26-Prolefeed.html">4 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-26-Prolefeed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Anthony Burgess’s review of “The Batsford Companion to Popular Literature,” by Victor Neuberg:
  
Arthur J. Burks (1898-1974) was no gentleman.  During the 1930s, when he would sometimes have nearly two million words in current publication, he aimed at producing 18,000 words a day.

 
Editors would call me up and ask me to do a novelette by the next afternoon, and I would, but it nearly killed me. . . .  I once appeared on the covers of eleven magazines the same month, and then almost killed myself for years trying to make it twelve.  I never did.
 

[Masanao:   I think you know where I'm heading with that story.]


Ursula Bloom, born 1985 and still with us [this was written sometime between 1978 and 1985], is clearly no lady.  Writing also under the pseudonyms of Lozania Prole (there’s an honest name for you), Sheila Burnes and Mary Essex, she has produced 486 boooks, beginning with  Tiger  at the age of seven. . . .

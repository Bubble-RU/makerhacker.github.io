<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.16414186 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>4 0.16043074 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-29-Zero_is_zero.html">687 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-29-Zero is zero</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nathan Roseberry writes:
  
I thought I had read on your blog that bar charts should always include zero on the scale, but a search of your blog (or google) didn’t return what I was looking for.  Is it considered a best practice to always include zero on the axis for bar charts?  Has this been written in a book?
  
My reply:
 
The idea is that the area of the bar represents “how many” or “how much.” The bar has to go down to 0 for that to work.  You don’t have to have your y-axis go to zero, but if you want the axis to go anywhere else, don’t use a bar graph, use a line graph.  Usually line graphs are better anyway.
 
I’m sure this is all in a book somewhere.</p><p>5 0.15182179 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.  A graph in a journal such as Science or Nature is meant to grab the eye of a busy reader (or to go viral on</p><p>6 0.85216653 <a title="37-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Graph_of_the_year.html">488 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Graph of the year</a></p>

I don’t think so.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

 This  report claims that eating meat increases the risk of cancer.  I’m sure you can’t read the page but you probably can understand the graphs. Different bars represent subdivision in the amount of the particular type of meat one consumes. And each chunk is different types of meat. Left is for male right is for female.


They claim that the difference is significant, but they are clearly not!!


I’m for not eating much meat but this is just way too much…
  
Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
I don’t know what to think.  If you look carefully you can find one or two statistically significant differences but overall the pattern doesn’t look so compelling.  I don’t know what the top and bottom rows are, though.  Overall, the pattern in the top row looks like it could represent a real trend, while the graphs on the bottom row look like noise.
 
This could be a good example for our multiple comparisons paper.  If the researchers won’t</p><p>3 0.9290899 <a title="37-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-17-Subway_series.html">1810 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-17-Subway series</a></p>

This graph is a good starting point but I think more could be done, both in the analysis and purely in the graphics.  Putting the two lines together like this with a fixed ratio is just too crude a tool.

<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .

For tests of this nature, I typically measure a variety of variables (image placement, size, type, page speed, “page feel” as expressed in a factor, etc) and use LOGIT, Cluster and possibly a simple Bayesian model to determine which variables were most significant (chosen). Pearson Chi-squared may be used to express relationships between variables and outcome but I’ve typically not used it to simply judge a 0/1 choice as statistically significant or not.

<p>Introduction: The title of  this post  by Sanjay Srivastava illustrates an annoying misconception that’s crept into the (otherwise delightful) recent  publicity  related to my  article  with Hal Stern, he difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant.
 
When people bring this up, they keep referring to the difference between p=0.05 and p=0.06, making the familiar (and correct) point about the arbitrariness of the conventional p-value threshold of 0.05.  And, sure, I agree with this, but everybody knows that already.
 
The point Hal and I were making was that even apparently large differences in p-values are not statistically significant. For example, if you have one study with z=2.5 (almost significant at the 1% level!) and another with z=1 (not statistically significant at all, only 1 se from zero!), then their difference has a z of about 1 (again, not statistically significant at all). So it’s not just a comparison of 0.05 vs. 0.06, even a differenc</p><p>4 0.1076423 <a title="401-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-29-Ken_Rice_presents_a_unifying_approach_to_statistical_inference_and_hypothesis_testing.html">2312 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-29-Ken Rice presents a unifying approach to statistical inference and hypothesis testing</a></p>

In the recent discussion on  stopping rules  I saw a comment that I wanted to chip in on, but thought it might get a bit lost, in the already long thread. Apologies in advance if I misinterpreted what you wrote, or am trying to tell you things you already know.


 The comment  was: “In Bayesian decision making, there is a utility function and you choose the decision with highest expected utility. Making a decision based on statistical significance does not correspond to any utility function.”


… which immediately suggests  this  little 2010 paper; A Decision-Theoretic Formulation of Fisher’s Approach to Testing, The American Statistician, 64(4) 345-349. It contains utilities that lead to decisions that very closely mimic classical Wald tests, and provides a rationale for why this utility is not totally unconnected from how some scientists think. Some (old) slides discussing it  are here .

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

How do you test for no effect? I attended a seminar where the person assumed that a non significant difference between groups implied an absence of effect. In that case, the researcher needed to show that two groups were similar before being hit by a shock conditional on some observable variables. The assumption was that the two groups were similar and that the shock was random. What would be the good way to set up a test in that case?


I know you’ve been through that before (http://andrewgelman.com/2009/02/not_statistical/) and there are interesting comments but I wanted to have your opinion on that.

Brain scans may be able to predict what you will do better than you can yourself . . .  They found a way to interpret “real time” brain images to show whether people who viewed messages about using sunscreen would actually use sunscreen during the following week.


The scans were more accurate than the volunteers were, Emily Falk and colleagues at the University of California Los Angeles reported in the Journal of Neuroscience. . . .


About half the volunteers had correctly predicted whether they would use sunscreen. The research team analyzed and re-analyzed the MRI scans to see if they could find any brain activity that would do better.


Activity in one area of the brain, a particular part of the medial prefrontal cortex, provided the best information.


“From this region of the brain, we can predict for about three-quarters of the people whether they will increase their use of sunscreen beyond what they say they will do,” Lieberman said.

There’s  a letter  in the latest issue of The Economist (July 31st) signed by Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), Michael Masters (Masters Capital Management) and David Frenk (Better Markets) about an    “>OECD report  on speculation and the prices of commodities, which includes the following: “The report uses a Granger causality test to measure the relationship between the level of commodities futures contracts held by swap dealers, and the prices of those commodities. Granger tests, however, are of dubious applicability to extremely volatile variables like commodities prices.”
  
The report says:
  
Granger causality is a standard statistical technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. It is important to bear in mind that the term causality is used in a statistical sense, and not in a philosophical one of structural causation. More precisely a variable A is said to Granger cause B if knowing the time paths of B and A toge</p><p>6 0.7712729 <a title="401-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-The_scope_for_snooping.html">1070 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-The scope for snooping</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.  As Antony and I worked more on our paper, and especially after seeing the discussions by Robert Kosara, Stephen Few, Hadley Wickham, and Paul Murrell (all to appear in Journal of Computati</p><p>2 0.96456778 <a title="401-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-20-Ugly_ugly_ugly.html">1684 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-20-Ugly ugly ugly</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

I [Mulford] ran across  this blog post  and found myself questioning the relevance of the test used.


I’d think Chi-Square would be inappropriate for trying to measure significance of choice in the manner presented here; irrespective of the cute hamster.  Since this is a common test for marketers and website developers – I’d be interested in which techniques you might suggest?


For tests of this nature, I typically measure a variety of variables (image placement, size, type, page speed, “page feel” as expressed in a factor, etc) and use LOGIT, Cluster and possibly a simple Bayesian model to determine which variables were most significant (chosen). Pearson Chi-squared may be used to express relationships between variables and outcome but I’ve typically not used it to simply judge a 0/1 choice as statistically significant or not.

<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: Christian points me to  this  amusing story by Jonah Lehrer about Mohan Srivastava, (perhaps the same person as R. Mohan Srivastava, coauthor of a book called Applied Geostatistics) who discovered a flaw in a scratch-off game in which he could figure out which tickets were likely to win based on partial information visible on the ticket.  It appears that scratch-off lotteries elsewhere have similar flaws in their design.
 
The obvious question is, why doesn’t the lottery create the patterns on the tickets (including which “teaser” numbers to reveal) completely at random?  It shouldn’t be hard to design this so that zero information is supplied from the outside. in which case Srivastava’s trick would be impossible.
 
So why not put down the numbers randomly?  Lehrer quotes Srivastava as saying:
  
The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers. Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random</p><p>6 0.94651854 <a title="401-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-17-How_to_map_geographically-detailed_survey_responses%3F.html">1124 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-17-How to map geographically-detailed survey responses?</a></p>

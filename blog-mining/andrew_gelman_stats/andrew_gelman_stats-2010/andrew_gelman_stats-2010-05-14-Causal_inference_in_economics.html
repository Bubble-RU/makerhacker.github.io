Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)

<p>Introduction: Matthew Bogard writes:
  
Regarding the book Mostly Harmless Econometrics, you  state :

 
A casual reader of the book might be left with the unfortunate impression that matching is a competitor to regression rather than a tool for making regression more effective.
 

But in fact isn’t that what they are arguing, that, in a  ‘mostly harmless way’ regression is in fact a matching estimator itself?


“Our view is that regression can be motivated as a particular sort of weighted matching estimator, and therefore the differences between regression and matching estimates are unlikely to be of major empirical importance” (Chapter 3 p. 70)


They seem to be distinguishing regression (without prior matching) from all other types of matching techniques, and therefore implying that regression can be a ‘mostly harmless’ substitute or competitor to matching. My previous understanding, before starting this book was as you say, that matching is a tool that makes regression more effective.

<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).

<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>3 0.76219946 <a title="32-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-22-Struggles_over_the_criticism_of_the_%E2%80%9Ccannabis_users_and_IQ_change%E2%80%9D_paper.html">1910 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-22-Struggles over the criticism of the “cannabis users and IQ change” paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>4 0.76047975 <a title="32-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-02-Reintegrating_rebels_into_civilian_life%3A_Quasi-experimental_evidence_from_Burundi.html">177 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-02-Reintegrating rebels into civilian life: Quasi-experimental evidence from Burundi</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Gilligan, Eric Mvukiyehe, and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Gilligan, Mvukiyehe, and Samii] use original survey data, collected in Burundi in the summer of 2007, to show that a World Bank ex-combatant reintegration program implemented after Burundi’s civil war caused significant economic reintegration for its beneficiaries but that this economic reintegration did not translate into greater political and social reintegration.


Previous studies of reintegration programs have found them to be ineffective, but these studies have suffered from selection bias: only ex-combatants who self selected into those programs were studied. We avoid such bias with a quasi-experimental research design made possible by an exogenous bureaucratic failure in the implementation of program. One of the World Bank’s implementing partners delayed implementation by almost a year due to an unforeseen contract dispute. As a result, roughly a third of ex-combatants had their program benefits withheld for reas</p><p>5 0.75420338 <a title="32-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>

This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”


Further, “Despite the fact that the United States, Denmark and Argentina have very different welfare systems, we still see that — at the psychol</p><p>6 0.75240827 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-07-Descriptive_statistics%2C_causal_inference%2C_and_story_time.html">789 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-07-Descriptive statistics, causal inference, and story time</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture. And when we look at world-wide revenues, this film brought in more than $1.5 billion. . . . Despite what seems like a clear endorsement by the customers of this industry, the Avengers was ignored by the Oscars.  Perhaps this is just because I am an econo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95653796 <a title="32-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Causal_inference_in_economics.html">32 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Causal inference in economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>3 0.95451343 <a title="32-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-02-Roads%2C_traffic%2C_and_the_importance_in_decision_analysis_of_carefully_examining_your_goals.html">988 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-02-Roads, traffic, and the importance in decision analysis of carefully examining your goals</a></p>

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.  Sure, traffic congestion is annoying, but there must be some advantages to driving on that crowded road or pe</p><p>4 0.95281464 <a title="32-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-17-Vote_Buying%3A_Evidence_from_a_List_Experiment_in_Lebanon.html">283 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-17-Vote Buying: Evidence from a List Experiment in Lebanon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Corstange  writes :
  
Who sells their votes? Clientelism and vote buying are pervasive electoral practices in developing-world democracies and autocracies alike. I [Corstange] argue that buyers, regardless of regime type, prefer cheap voters, but that parties operating in uncompetitive environments are better able to price discriminate than those operating in competitive elections. I use an augmented list experiment to examine vote selling at the microlevel in Lebanon, in which both types of environment existed in its 2009 elections. I find that just over half of the electorate sold their votes, which is more than double the proportion willing to admit it. The evidence further shows that voters with low reservation prices are most likely to sell, and that monopsonistic buyers are better able to price discriminate among sellers than are dueling machines.

A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?

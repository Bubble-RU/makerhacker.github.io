Apr 26, 2013


Dear  Andrew Gelman


You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years. Currently, content on the Journal is closed access for the first 2 years after publication, and then freely accessible thereafter.  On June 1, 2013, the Journal will be extending its closed-access window from 2 years to 10 years. Extending this window will close public access to your article via the Journal web portal, but public access will still be available via the National Institutes of Health PubMedCentral web portal. 


If you would like to make your article available to the public for free on the Journal web portal, we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate of  $1,000 per article. If interested in purchasing this access, please contact Brian Selzer, Publications Editor, at brian.selzer@apha.org

<p>Introduction: Now here’s a foundation I (Bob) can get behind: 
  

 Foundation for Open Access Statistics  (FOAS)

  
Their  mission  is to “promote free software, open access publishing, and reproducible research in statistics.”  To me, that’s like supporting  motherhood and apple pie !
 
FOAS spun out of and is partially designed to support the   Journal of Statistical Software   (aka  JSS , aka  JStatSoft ). I adore  JSS  because it (a) is open access, (b) publishes systems papers on statistical software, (c) has fast reviewing turnaround times, and (d) is free for authors and readers.  One of the next items on my to-do list is to write up the  Stan  modeling language and submit it to  JSS .
 
As a not-for-profit with no visible source of income, they are quite sensibly  asking for donations  (don’t complain — it beats $3K author fees or not being able to read papers).</p><p>5 0.13072026 <a title="58-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-The_weirdest_thing_about_the_AJPH_story.html">1916 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-The weirdest thing about the AJPH story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Earlier today I  posted  a weird email that began with “You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years” and continued with a sleazy attempt to squeeze $1000 out of me so that an article that I sent them for free could be available to the public.  $1000 might seem like a lot, but they assured me that “we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate.”  Sort of like a Vegematic but without that set of Ginsu knives thrown in for free.
 
But then when I was responding to comments, I realized that . . . I didn’t actually remember ever publishing anything in that journal.  It’s not on my list of 100+ journals.  I did a search on my published papers page and couldn’t find anything closer than the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health (and that was not within the last few years).

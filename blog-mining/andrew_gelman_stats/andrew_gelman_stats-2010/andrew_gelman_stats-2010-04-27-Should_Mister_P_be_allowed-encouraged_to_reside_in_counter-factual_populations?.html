<p>Introduction: Chris Hane writes:
  
I am scientist needing to model a treatment effect on a population of ~500 people.  The dependent variable in the model is the difference in a person’s pre-treatment 12 month total medical cost versus post-treatment cost.  So there is large variation in costs, but not so much by using the difference between the pre and post treatment costs.  The issue I’d like some advice on is that the treatment has already occurred so there is no possibility of creating a fully randomized control now.  I do have a very large population of people to use as possible controls via propensity scoring or exact matching.  


If I had a few thousand people to possibly match, then I would use standard techniques.  However, I have a potential population of over a hundred thousand people.  An exact match of the possible controls to age, gender and region of the country still leaves a population of 10,000 controls.

<p>Introduction: David Radwin asks a question which comes up fairly often in one form or another:
  
How should one respond to requests for statistical hypothesis tests for population (or universe) data?


I [Radwin] first encountered this issue as an undergraduate when a professor suggested a statistical significance test for my paper comparing roll call votes between freshman and veteran members of Congress. Later I learned that such tests apply only to samples because their purpose is to tell you whether the difference in the observed sample is likely to exist in the population. If you have data for the whole population, like all members of the 103rd House of Representatives, you do not need a test to discern the true difference in the population. 


Sometimes researchers assume some sort of superpopulation like “all possible Congresses” or “Congresses across all time” and that the members of any given Congress constitute a sample. In my current work in education research, it is sometimes asserted t</p><p>4 0.159237 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-31-No_on_Yes-No_decisions.html">2155 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-31-No on Yes-No decisions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just to elaborate on our  post  from last month (“I’m negative on the expression ‘false positives’”), here’s a recent exchange exchange we had regarding the relevance of yes/no decisions in summarizing statistical inferences about scientific questions.

Isn’t it true that I am already done if P(theta>0) is much larger than P(theta<0)? I don't need to compute any loss function if the former is 0.99 and the latter 0.01.

To which I  replied :
  
In some way the problem is with the focus on “theta.” Effects (and, more generally, comparisons) vary, they can be positive for some people in some settings and negative for other people in other settings. If you’re talking about a single “theta,” you have to define what population and what scenario you are thinking about.

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein asks for my thoughts as  a Bayesian on the above topic.  So here they are (briefly):
 
The concept of the bias-variance tradeoff can be useful if you don’t take it too seriously.  The basic idea is as follows:  if you’re estimating something, you can slice your data finer and finer, or perform more and more adjustments, each time getting a purer—and less biased—estimate.  But each subdivision or each adjustment reduces your sample size or increases potential estimation error, hence the variance of your estimate goes up.
 
That story is real.  In lots and lots of examples, there’s a continuum between a completely unadjusted general estimate (high bias, low variance) and a specific, focused, adjusted estimate (low bias, high variance).
 
Suppose, for example, you’re using data from a large experiment to estimate the effect of a treatment on a fairly narrow group, say, white men between the ages of 45 and 50.  At one extreme, you could just take the estimated treatment e</p><p>6 0.14505346 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-The_placebo_effect_in_pharma.html">388 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-The placebo effect in pharma</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  discussed  the evaluation of somewhat-plausible claims that are somewhat supported by theory and somewhat supported by statistical evidence.  One point I raised was that an implausibly large estimate of effect size can be cause for concern:
  
Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the name-choice article by Pelham et al.) argued that the implied effects were too large to be believed (just as I was arguing above regarding the July 4th study), which makes more plausible his claims that the results arise from methodological artifacts.


That calculation is straight Bayes: the distribution of systematic errors has much longer tails than the distribution of random errors, so the larger the estimated effect, the more likely it is to be a mistake. This little theoretical result is a bit annoying, because it is the larger effects that are the most interesting!”
  
Larry Bartels notes that my reasoning above is a bit incoherent:

<p>Introduction: The title of this post is silly but I have an important point to make, regarding an implicit model which I think many people assume even though it does not really make sense.
 
Following a link from Sanjay Srivastava, I came across  a post  from David Funder saying that it’s useful to talk about the sizes of effects (I actually prefer the term “comparisons” so as to avoid the causal baggage) rather than just their signs.  I  agree , and I wanted to elaborate a bit on a point that comes up in Funder’s discussion.  He quotes an (unnamed) prominent social psychologist as writing:
  
The key to our research . . . [is not] to accurately estimate effect size. If I were testing an advertisement for a marketing research firm and wanted to be sure that the cost of the ad would produce enough sales to make it worthwhile, effect size would be crucial. But when I am testing a theory about whether, say, positive mood reduces information processing in comparison with negative mood, I am worried abou</p><p>4 0.79490852 <a title="7-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-18-Question_on_Type_M_errors.html">963 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-18-Question on Type M errors</a></p>

Today during the group meeting at my new job we were revising a paper whose main conclusions were sustained by an ANOVA.


One of the first observations is that the experiment had a small sample size. Interestingly (may not so), some of the reported effects (most of them interactions) were quite large. One of the experience group members said that “there is a common wisdom that one should not believe effects from small sample sizes but [he thinks] if they [the effects] are large enough to be picked on a small study they must be real large effects”. I argued that if the sample size is small one could incur on a M-type error in which the magnitude of the effect is being over-estimated and that if larger samples are evaluated the magnitude may become smaller and also the confidence intervals. The concept of M-type error is completely new to all other members of the group (on which I am in my second week) and I was given the job of finding a suitable ref to explain</p><p>5 0.75353843 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-02-The_inevitable_problems_with_statistical_significance_and_95%25_intervals.html">1150 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-02-The inevitable problems with statistical significance and 95% intervals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m thinking more and more that we have to get rid of statistical significance, 95% intervals, and all the rest, and just come to a more fundamental acceptance of uncertainty.
 
In practice, I think we use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests as a way to avoid acknowledging uncertainty. We set up some rules and then act as if we know what is real and what is not. Even in my own applied work, I’ve often enough presented 95% intervals and gone on from there. But maybe that’s just not right.
 
I was thinking about this after receiving the following email from a psychology student: 
  
  
I [the student] am trying to conceptualize the lessons in  your paper with Stern  with comparing treatment effects across studies.

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago I was cleaning out the closet and found some old unread magazines.  Good stuff.  As we’ve discussed  before , lots of things are better read a few years late.
 
Today I was reading the 18 Nov 2004 issue of the London Review of Books, which contained (among other things) the following:
 
- A review by Jenny Diski of a biography of Stanley Milgram.  Diski appears to want to debunk:
  
Milgram was a whiz at devising sexy experiments, but barely interested in any theoretical basis for them.  They all have the same instant attractiveness of style, and then an underlying emptiness.
  
Huh?  Michael Jordan couldn’t hit the curveball and he was reportedly an easy mark for golf hustlers but that doesn’t diminish his greatness on the basketball court.

<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:
  
Check out the figure below from The Grammar of Graphics. Dan Rope invented this graphic and programmed it in Java in the late 1990′s. We shopped this graph around to Orbitz and Expedia but they weren’t interested.

<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>5 0.94899338 <a title="7-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-Approaching_harmonic_convergence.html">1099 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-Approaching harmonic convergence</a></p>

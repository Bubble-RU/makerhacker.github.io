<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.  That ain’t right.  Let the student hold the pen.

<p>Introduction: Anthony Goldbloom writes:
  
For those who haven’t come across Kaggle, we are a new platform for data prediction competitions. Companies and researchers put up a dataset and a problem and data scientists compete to produce the best solutions. 


We’ve just launched a new initiative called Kaggle in Class, allowing instructors to host competitions for their students. Competitions are a neat way to engage students, giving them the opportunity to put into practice what they learn. The platform offers live leaderboards, so students get instant feedback on the accuracy of their work. And since competitions are judged on objective criteria (predictions are compared with outcomes), the platform offers unique assessment 
opportunities.

<p>Introduction: Now that September has arrived, it’s time for us to think teaching.   Here’s something  from Andrew Heckler and Eleanor Sayre.  Heckler writes:
  
The article describes a project studying the performance of university level students taking an intro physics course. Every week for ten weeks we took 1/10th of the students (randomly selected only once) and gave them the same set of questions relevant to the course. This allowed us to plot the evolution of average performance in the class during the quarter.  We can then determine when learning occurs: For example, do they learn the material in a relevant lecture or lab or homework? Since we had about 350 students taking the course, we could get some reasonable stats.


In particular, you might be interested in Figure 10 (page 774) which shows student performance day-by-day on a particular question.  The performance does not change directly after lecture, but rather only when the homework was due.

Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>4 0.97125882 <a title="277-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Non-statistical_thinking_in_the_US_foreign_policy_establishment.html">721 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Non-statistical thinking in the US foreign policy establishment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m a few weeks behind in my New Yorker reading and so just recently read  this fascinating article  by Ryan Lizza on the current administration’s foreign policy.  He gives some insights into the transformation Obama from antiwar candidate to a president conducting three wars.
 
Speaking as a statistician, though, what grabbed my eye was a doctrine of journalist/professor/policymaker Samantha Power.  Lizza writes:
  
In 2002, after graduating from Harvard Law School, she wrote “A Problem from Hell,” which surveyed the grim history of six genocides committed in the twentieth century. Propounding a liberal-interventionist view, Power argued that “mass killing” on the scale of Rwanda or Bosnia must be prevented by other nations, including the United States. She wrote that America and its allies rarely have perfect information about when a regime is about to commit genocide; a President, therefore, must have “a bias toward belief” that massacres are imminent.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  pointed  me to a new  blog post  by Stephen Dubner in which he expresses disagreement with what Kaiser and I wrote in our American Scientist  article , “Freakonomics:  What Went Wrong?”.
 
In response, I thought it would be interesting to go “meta” here by considering all the different ways ways that I  could  reply to Dubner’s criticism of our criticism of his writings.  (In the same post, Dubner also slams Chris Blattman (or, as he calls him, “a man named Chris Blattman”), but I won’t get into that here.)
 
In reacting to Dubner, I will give several perspectives,  all of which I believe .  Usually in writing a response, one would have to choose, but here I find it interesting to present all these different perspectives in one place.
 
 1.  Understand. 
 
I understand where Dubner is coming from.    We say some positive things and some negative things about his work, but it’s natural for him to focus on the negative.

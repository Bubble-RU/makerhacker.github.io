<p>Introduction: I’ve occasionally mocked academic economists for their discussions of research papers as “singles” or “home runs” (a world in which, counter to the findings of sabermetrics, one of the latter is worth more than four of the former).

<p>Introduction: Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay writes:
  
I am convinced of the power of hierarchical modeling and individual parameter pooling concept. I was wondering how could multi-level modeling could influence the estimate of grad mean (NOT individual label).
  
My reply:  Multilevel modeling will affect the estimate of the grand mean in two ways:
 
1.  If the group-level mean is correlated with group size, then the partial pooling will change the estimate of the grand mean (and, indeed, you might want to include group size or some similar variable as a group-level predictor.
 
2.  In any case, the extra error term(s) in a multilevel model will typically affect the standard error of everything, including the estimate of the grand mean.</p><p>3 0.10872196 <a title="47-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-22-Top_5_stat_papers_since_2000%3F.html">1951 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-22-Top 5 stat papers since 2000?</a></p>

Even though I’m an engineer with a PhD in political science, I tend to gravitate toward history to anchor my contextual lens. (If fact, if I were pressed to put a methodological stake in the ground, I would say I’m a historical comparative institutional ecologist.) In that regard, it may be helpful to situate this discussion within the broader historical arc of intellectual pursuits at universities. As we know with the birth of universities, we had scholars who embodied so many disciplines such as mathematics, philosophy, religion law, etc into one individual. Then in the 50′s and 60′s we started going into hyper-specialization mode, and it was necessary because we needed to better understand our specific domains. In the 80s and 90s, certain disciplines started to recognize the importance of other disciplines on their work but the tendency was to bring those skills into a single individual.

<p>Introduction: Responding to a proposal to move the journal Political Analysis from double-blind to single-blind reviewing (that is, authors would not know who is reviewing their papers but reviewers would know the authors’ names), Tom Palfrey writes:
  
I agree with the editors’ recommendation. I have served on quite a few editorial boards of journals with different blinding policies, and have seen no evidence that double blind procedures are a useful way to improve the quality of articles published in a journal. Aside from the obvious administrative nuisance and the fact that authorship anonymity is a thing of the past in our discipline, the theoretical and empirical arguments in both directions lead to an ambiguous conclusion. Also keep in mind that the editors know the identity of the authors (they need to know for practical reasons), their identity is not hidden from authors, and ultimately it is they who make the accept/reject decision, and also lobby their friends and colleagues to submit “the</p><p>3 0.71054715 <a title="47-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-30-Retracted_articles_and_unethical_behavior_in_economics_journals%3F.html">1435 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-30-Retracted articles and unethical behavior in economics journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>4 0.70447081 <a title="47-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-12-Historical_Arc_of_Universities.html">2330 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-12-Historical Arc of Universities</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.
 
I’m reminded of a bizarrely-retro  remark  from a couple years ago by Colin (“at age 22″) Camerer.  In response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer said:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”

<p>Introduction: I’ve occasionally mocked academic economists for their discussions of research papers as “singles” or “home runs” (a world in which, counter to the findings of sabermetrics, one of the latter is worth more than four of the former). The best thing, of course, is a “grand slam,” a term that I always found particularly silly as it depends not just on the quality of the hit but also on external considerations (“men on base”).  But then I was thinking about this again, and I decided the analogy isn’t so bad:  For a research paper to be really influential and important, it has to come at the right time, and the field has to be ready for it.  That’s what turns a home run into a grand slam.  So in this case the reasoning works pretty well.</p><p>2 0.90942556 <a title="47-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-16-Groundhog_day_in_August%3F.html">913 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-16-Groundhog day in August?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Due to my similar interest in  plagiarism , I went to The Human Cultural and Social Landscape session. [The recipient of the American Statistical Association's Founders Award in 2002] gave the first talk in the session instead of Yasmin Said, which was modestly attended (20 or so people) and gave a sociology talk with no numbers — and no attribution to where these ideas (on Afghanistan culture) came from. Would it really have hurt to give the source of this? I’m on board with plain laziness for this one.


I think he may have mentioned a number of his collaborators at the beginning, and all he talked about were cultural customs and backgrounds, no science to speak of.
  
It’s kind of amazing to me that he actually showed up at JSM, but of course if he had any shame, he wouldn’t have repeatedly  stolen  copied without proper attribution in the first place.  It’s not even like Doris Kearns Goodwin who reportedly produced a well-written book out of it!</p><p>3 0.89989793 <a title="47-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Applying_quantum_probability_to_political_science.html">877 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Applying quantum probability to political science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:
  
We [Smith and Zorn] expand the substantive terrain of QI’s reach by illuminating a body of political theory that to date has been elaborated in strictly classical language and formalisms but has complex features that seem to merit generalizations of the prob</p><p>4 0.89957333 <a title="47-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-14-The_General_Social_Survey_is_a_great_resource.html">958 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-14-The General Social Survey is a great resource</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Remember that bizarre episode in Freakonomics 2, where Levitt and Dubner went to the Batcave-like lair of a genius billionaire who told them that “the problem with solar panels is that they’re  black .”  I’m  not the only one  who wondered at the time:  of all the issues to bring up about solar power, why that one?
 
Well, I think I’ve found the answer in  this article  by John Lanchester:
  
In 2004, Nathan Myhrvold, who had, five years earlier, at the advanced age of forty, retired from his job as Microsoft’s chief technology officer, began to contribute to the culinary discussion board egullet.org . . .

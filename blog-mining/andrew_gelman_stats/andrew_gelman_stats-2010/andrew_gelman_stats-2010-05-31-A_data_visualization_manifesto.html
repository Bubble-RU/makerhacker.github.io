I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>5 0.21962497 <a title="61-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-R_needs_a_good_function_to_make_line_plots.html">252 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-R needs a good function to make line plots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: More and more I’m thinking that line plots are great.  More specifically, two-way grids of line plots on common scales, with one, two, or three lines per plot (enough to show comparisons but not so many that you can’t tell the lines apart).  Also dot plots, of the sort that have been masterfully used by Lax and Phillips to show comparisons and trends in support for gay rights.
 
There’s a big step missing, though, and that is to be able to make these graphs as a default.  We have to figure out the right way to structure the data so these graphs come naturally.
 
Then when it’s all working, we can talk the Excel people into implementing our ideas.  I’m not asking to be paid here; all our ideas are in the public domain and I’m happy for Microsoft or Google or whoever to copy us.

This could be accomplished with ggplot2 using various combinations of the grammar.  If I am understanding what you mean by line plots,  here are some examples with code .

<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to  this blog  that reports on  a study  by Scott Bateman, Carl Gutwin, David McDine, Regan Mandryk, Aaron Genest, and Christopher Brooks that claims the following:
  
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‘chart junk’–visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. . . . we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people’s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better.
  
As the above-linked blogger puts it, “chartjunk is more useful than plain graphs. . . . Tufte is not going to like this.”
 
I can’t speak for Ed Tufte, but I’m not gonna take this claim about chartjunk lying down.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.

<p>Introduction: Jerzy Wieczorek has an interesting  review  of the book Graph Design for the Eye and Mind by psychology researcher Stephen Kosslyn. I recommend you read all of Wieczorek’s review (and maybe Kosslyn’s book, but that I haven’t seen), but here I’ll just focus on one point. Here’s Wieczorek summarizing Kosslyn:
  

p. 18-19: the horizontal axis should be for the variable with the “most important part of the data.” See Kosslyn’s Figure 1.6 and 1.7 below. Figure 1.6 clearly shows that one of the sex-by-income groups reacts to age differently than the other three groups do. Figure 1.7 uses sex as the x-axis variable, making it much harder to see this same effect in the data. 
As a statistician exploring the data, I might make several plots using different groupings… but for communicating my results to an audience, I would choose the one plot that shows the findings most clearly.

<p>Introduction: Jeff Ratto points me to  this  news article by Dean Baker reporting the work of three economists, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who  found  errors in a much-cited  article  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff analyzing historical statistics of economic growth and public debt.  Mike Konczal  provides  a clear summary; that’s where I got the above image.
 
 Errors in data processing and data analysis 
 
It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff flubbed it.  Herndon et al. write of “spreadsheet errors, omission of available data, weighting, and transcription.”  The spreadsheet errors are the most embarrassing, but the other choices in data analysis seem pretty bad too.  It can be tough to work with small datasets, so I have sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, but it does look like they were jumping to conclusions in their paper.  Perhaps the urgency of the topic moved them to publish as fast as possible rather than carefully considering the impact of their data-analytic choi</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96856016 <a title="61-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-31-A_data_visualization_manifesto.html">61 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-31-A data visualization manifesto</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.

<p>Introduction: During our discussion of estimates of teacher performance, Steve Sailer  wrote :
  
I suspect we’re going to take years to work the kinks out of overall rating systems.


By way of analogy, Bill James kicked off the modern era of baseball statistics analysis around 1975. But he stuck to doing smaller scale analyses and avoided trying to build one giant overall model for rating players. In contrast, other analysts such as Pete Palmer rushed into building overall ranking systems, such as his 1984 book, but they tended to generate curious results such as the greatness of Roy Smalley Jr.. James held off until 1999 before unveiling his win share model for overall rankings.
  
I remember looking at Pete Palmer’s book many years ago and being disappointed that he did everything through his Linear Weights formula. A hit is worth X, a walk is worth Y, etc.  Some of this is good–it’s presumably an improvement on counting walks as 0 or 1 hits, also an improvement on counting doubles and triples a</p><p>5 0.9634881 <a title="61-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-14-The_robust_beauty_of_improper_linear_models_in_decision_making.html">1981 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-14-The robust beauty of improper linear models in decision making</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andreas Graefe writes (see  here   here   here ):
  
The usual procedure for developing linear models to predict any kind of target variable is to identify a subset of most important predictors and to estimate weights that provide the best possible solution for a given sample. The resulting “optimally” weighted linear composite is then used when predicting new data. This approach is useful in situations with large and reliable datasets and few predictor variables. However, a large body of analytical and empirical evidence since the 1970s shows that the weighting of variables is of little, if any, value in situations with small and noisy datasets and a large number of predictor variables. In such situations, including all relevant variables is more important than their weighting. These findings have yet to impact many fields. This study uses data from nine established U.S. election-forecasting models whose forecasts are regularly published in academic journals to demonstrate the value o</p><p>6 0.96304893 <a title="61-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-16-What_I_learned_from_those_tough_538_commenters.html">210 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-16-What I learned from those tough 538 commenters</a></p>

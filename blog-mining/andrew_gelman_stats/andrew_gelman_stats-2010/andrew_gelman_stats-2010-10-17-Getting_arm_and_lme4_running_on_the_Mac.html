You and your blog readers may be interested to know that a we’ve released a major new version of the BayesFactor package to CRAN. The package computes Bayes factors for linear mixed models and regression models. Of course, I’m aware you don’t like point-null model comparisons, but the package does more than that; it also allows sampling from posterior distributions of the compared models, in much the same way that your arm package does with lmer objects. The sampling (both for the Bayes factors and posteriors) is quite fast, since the back end is written in C.


Some basic examples using the package can be found  here , and the CRAN page is  here .
  
Indeed I don’t like point-null model comparisons . . . but maybe this will be useful to some of you!</p><p>5 0.15257336 <a title="347-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-21-Lessons_learned_from_a_recent_R_package_submission.html">1134 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-21-Lessons learned from a recent R package submission</a></p>

A colleague sends in some suugestions based on a recent experience with a package update:
  
 1. Always use the R dev version to write a package.  Not the current stable release.  The R people use the R dev version to check your package anyway.  If you don’t use the R dev version, there is chance that your package won’t pass the check.  In my own experience, every time R has a major change, it tends to have new standards and find new errors in your package with these new standards.  So better use the dev version to find out the potential errors in advance.


 2. After submission, write an email to claim it.   I used to submit the package to the CRAN without writing an email.  This was standard operating procedure, but it has changed.

<p>Introduction: We need help picking out an automatic differentiation package for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior of a  generalized linear model with deep interactions.  Specifically, we need to compute gradients for log probability functions with thousands of parameters that involve matrix (determinants, eigenvalues, inverses), stats (distributions), and math (log gamma) functions.  Any suggestions?
    
 The Application: Hybrid Monte Carlo for Posteriors 
 
We’re getting serious about implementing posterior sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC speeds up mixing by including gradient information to help guide the Metropolis proposals toward areas  high probability.  In practice, the algorithm requires a handful or  of gradient calculations per sample, but there are many dimensions and the functions are hairy enough we don’t want to compute derivaties by hand.

I included the stereogram as a bit of humor just to show what could be done with J graphics.

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)


This does not appear to work since it wi</p><p>3 0.86434454 <a title="347-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-Super_Sam_Fuld_Needs_Your_Help_%28with_Foul_Ball_stats%29.html">802 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-Super Sam Fuld Needs Your Help (with Foul Ball stats)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

I am writing to seek your help in building a community driven Q&A; website tentatively called called ‘Statistics Analysis’. I am neither a founder of this website nor do I have any financial stake in its success. 


By way of background to this website, please see Stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/) and Mathoverflow (http://mathoverflow.net/). Stackoverflow is a Q&A; website targeted at software developers and is designed to help them ask questions and get answers from other developers.  Mathoverflow is a Q&A; website targeted at research mathematicians and is designed to help them ask and answer questions from other mathematicians across the world. The success of both these sites in helping their respective communities is a strong indicator that sites designed along these lines are very useful.

<p>Introduction: We had 28 class periods, so I wrote an exam with an approximate correspondence of one question per class.  Rather than dumping the exam in your lap all at once, I’ll post the questions once per day.  Then each day I’ll post the answer to yesterday’s questions.  So it will be 29 days in all.  I’ll post them to appear late in the day so as not to interfere with our main daily posts (which are currently backed up to early June).
 
The course was offered in the political science department and covered a mix of statistical and political topics.  Followers of our  recent discussion  on test questions won’t be surprised to learn that some of the questions are ambiguous.  This wasn’t on purpose.  I tried my best, but good questions are hard to write.

<p>Introduction: Gayle Laackmann  reports  ( link  from Felix Salmon) that Microsoft, Google, etc. don’t actually ask brain-teasers in their job interviews.  The actually ask a lot of questions about programming.  (I looked  here  and was relieved to see that the questions aren’t very hard.  I could probably get a job as an entry-level programmer if I needed to.)
 
Laackmann writes:
  
Let’s look at the very widely circulated “15 Google Interview Questions that will make you feel stupid” list [ here's the original list , I think, from Lewis Lin] . . . these questions are fake. Fake fake fake.  How can you tell that they’re fake?  Because one of them is “Why are manhole covers round?”  This is an infamous Microsoft interview question that has since been so very, very banned at both companies .  I find it very hard to believe that a Google interviewer asked such a question.
  
We’ll get back to the manhole question in a bit.

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  previous post , Andrew Wilson writes:
  
I agree we are in a really exciting time for statistics and machine learning.  There has been a lot of talk lately comparing machine learning with statistics.  I am curious whether you think there are many fundamental differences between the fields, or just superficial differences — different popular approximate inference methods, slightly different popular application areas, etc.  Is machine learning a subset of statistics?


In the paper we discuss how we think machine learning is fundamentally about pattern discovery, and ultimately, fully automating the learning and decision making process.  In other words, whatever a human does when he or she uses tools to analyze data, can be written down algorithmically and automated on a computer.  I am not sure if the ambitions are similar in statistics — and I don’t have any conventional statistics background, which makes it harder to tell. I think it’s an interesting discussion.</p><p>6 0.095883332 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-15-Forward_causal_reasoning_statements_are_about_estimation%3B_reverse_causal_questions_are_about_model_checking_and_hypothesis_generation.html">1939 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-15-Forward causal reasoning statements are about estimation; reverse causal questions are about model checking and hypothesis generation</a></p>

Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

<p>Introduction: StackOverflow  has been a  popular community where software developers would help one another. Recently they  raised some VC funding , and to make profits they are selling job postings and expanding the model to other areas.  Metaoptimize LLC  has started a similar website, using the open-source  OSQA framework  for such as statistics and machine learning. Here’s a description:
  

You and other data geeks can ask and answer questions on machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, text analysis, information retrieval, search, data mining, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
   

Here you can ask and answer questions, comment and vote for the questions of others and their answers. Both questions and answers can be revised and improved. Questions can be tagged with the relevant keywords to simplify future access and organize the accumulated material.

  
If you work very hard on your questions and answers, you will receive badges like “Guru”, “Studen</p><p>2 0.89304423 <a title="118-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-01-Doug_Schoen_has_2_poll_reports.html">985 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-01-Doug Schoen has 2 poll reports</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to  Chris Wilson , there are two versions of the report of the Occupy Wall Street poll from  so-called  hack pollster Doug Schoen.
 
 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.
 
P.S.   More here  from Kaiser Fung on fundamental flaws with Schoen’s poll.</p><p>3 0.88442147 <a title="118-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-Census_dotmap.html">1653 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-Census dotmap</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andrew Vande Moere points to  this  impressive interactive map from Brandon Martin-Anderson showing the locations of all the residents of the United States and Canada.
 
It says, “The map has 341,817,095 dots – one for each person.”  Not quite . . . I was hoping to zoom into my building (approximately 10 people live on our floor, I say approximately because two of the apartments are split between two floors and I’m not sure how they would assign the residents), but unfortunately our entire block is just a solid mass of black.  Also, they put a few dots in the park and in the river by accident (presumably because the borders of the census blocks were specified only approximately).  But, hey, no algorithm is perfect.
 
 
 
It’s hard to know what to do about this.  The idea of mapping every person is cool, but you’ll always run into trouble displaying densely populated areas.  Smaller dots might work, but then that might depend on the screen being used for display.</p><p>4 0.86889827 <a title="118-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-04-Columbo_does_posterior_predictive_checks.html">1521 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-04-Columbo does posterior predictive checks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m already on record as saying that  Ronald Reagan was a statistician  so I think this is ok too . . .
 
   
 
Here’s what Columbo does.  He hears the killer’s story and he takes it very seriously (it’s murder, and Columbo never jokes about murder), examines all its implications, and finds where it doesn’t fit the data.  Then Columbo carefully examines the discrepancies, tries some model expansion, and eventually concludes that he’s proved there’s a problem.
 
OK, now you’re saying:  Yeah, yeah, sure, but how does that differ from any other fictional detective?  The difference, I think, is that the tradition is for the detective to find clues and use these to come up with hypotheses, or to trap the killer via internal contradictions in his or her statement.  I see Columbo is different—and more in keeping with chapter 6 of Bayesian Data Analysis—in that he is taking the killer’s story seriously and exploring all its implications.  That’s the essence of predictive model checking:  you t</p><p>5 0.86815131 <a title="118-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-09-Google_correlate_links_statistics_with_minorities.html">1109 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-09-Google correlate links statistics with minorities</a></p>

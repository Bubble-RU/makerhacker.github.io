<p>Introduction: Kenny writes:
  
The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.


We invite applications from both new and experienced Ph.Ds, and women and underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.  For example, from an  official documen t, “The primary purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participati</p><p>6 0.16800436 <a title="361-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-02-Bayes_alert%21__Cool_postdoc_position_here_on_missing_data_imputation_and_applications_in_health_disparities_research%21.html">2047 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-02-Bayes alert!

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Eric Johnson (Columbia University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on the application of the latest methods of multilevel data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem:  forecasting retail sales at the individual item level.

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>5 0.82177144 <a title="361-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-18-Job_opening%21__Come_work_with_us%21.html">1904 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-18-Job opening!

<p>Introduction: See below for the job announcement.  It’s for Teachers College, which is about 2 blocks from the statistics department and 2 blocks from the political science department.  So even though I don’t have any official connection with Teachers College (besides occasionally working with them on research projects), I very much would like to have another exciting young applied researcher here, to complement all the people we currently have in stat, poli sci, engineering, etc.  In particular, we have zillions of interesting and important social science research projects going on here, and they all need statistics work.  A lot of social scientists do statistics, but it’s not so easy to find a statistician who does serious social science research.
 
All this is to say that I hope this job gets some applicants from some people who are serious about applied statistics and the development of new models and methods.

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  sends  along  this  from Corinne Moss-Racusin, John Dovidio, Victoria Brescoll, Mark Graham, and Jo Handelsman:
  
Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. . . . In a randomized double-blind study . . . science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. . . .
  
I hate to talk about things like this since presumably I’m a beneficiary.  But now that I’ve climbed the ladder myself I suppose I’m not at any risk.  I don’t know anything much about lab manager positions—that’s more something you’d see in a biology department—but I do</p><p>3 0.96104109 <a title="361-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-28-Should_Harvard_start_admitting_kids_at_random%3F.html">1595 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-28-Should Harvard start admitting kids at random?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  article  where Ron Unz provides evidence that Jews are way overrepresented at Ivy League colleges, with Asians-Americans and non-Jewish whites correspondingly underrepresented.  Unz attributes this to bias and pressure in the admissions office and recommends that, instead, top colleges should switch to a system based purely academic credentials (he never clearly defines these, but I assume he’s talking about high school grades, SAT scores, and prizes in recognized academic competitions).  He recommends that Harvard, for example, get rid of preferences for athletes, musicians, and rich people, and instead reserve one-fifth of their slots based on pure academic merit and with the remaining four-fifth “being randomly selected from the 30,000 or so American applicants considered able to reasonably perform at the school’s required academic level and thereby benefit from a Harvard education.”

<p>Introduction: New Year’s Day is an excellent time to look back at changes, not just in the past year, but in the past half-century.
 
Mark Palko has an interesting  post  on the pace of changes in everyday life.  We’ve been hearing a lot in the past few decades about how things are changing faster and faster.  But, as Palko points out, the difference between life in 1962 and life today does not seem so different, at least for many people in the United States.  Sure, there are some big changes:  nonwhites get more respect, people mostly live longer, many cancers can be cured, fewer people are really really poor but it’s harder to hold down a job, cars are more reliable, you can get fresh fish in the suburbs, containers are lighter and stronger, vacations in the Caribbean instead of the Catskills, people have a lot more stuff and a lot more place to put it, etc etc etc.  But life in the 1950s or 1960s just doesn’t seem so different from how we live today.
 
In contrast, Palko writes, “You can also get</p><p>5 0.95468396 <a title="361-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-11-Yes%2C_the_decision_to_try_%28or_not%29_to_have_a_child_can_be_made_rationally.html">1758 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-11-Yes, the decision to try (or not) to have a child can be made rationally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>6 0.95319909 <a title="361-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Economics_now_%3D_Freudian_psychology_in_the_1950s%3A__More_on_the_incoherence_of_%E2%80%9Ceconomics_exceptionalism%E2%80%9D.html">1213 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Economics now = Freudian psychology in the 1950s:  More on the incoherence of “economics exceptionalism”</a></p>

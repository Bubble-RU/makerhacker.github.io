<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung was  ahead of the curve  on Lance Armstrong:
  
The media has gotten the statistics totally backwards.


On the one hand, they faithfully report the colorful stories of athletes who fail drug tests pleading their innocence. (I have written about the Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador here.) On the other hand, they unquestioningly report athletes who claim “hundreds of negative tests” prove their honesty. Putting these two together implies that the media believes that negative test results are highly reliable while positive test results are unreliable.


The reality is just the opposite. When an athlete tests positive, it’s almost sure that he/she has doped. Sure, most of the clean athletes will test negative but what is often missed is that the majority of dopers will also test negative.


We don’t need to do any computation to see that this is true. In most major sports competitions, the  proportion of tests declared positive is typically below 1%.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday we had a spirited  discussion  of the following conditional probability puzzle:
  
“I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”
  
This reminded me of the principle, familiar from  statistics instruction  and the  cognitive psychology  literature, that the best way to teach these sorts of examples is through integers rather than fractions.
 
For example, consider this classic problem:
  
“10% of persons have disease X.  You are tested for the disease and test positive, and the test has 80% accuracy.  What is the probability that you have the disease?”
  
This can be solved directly using conditional probability but it appears to be clearer to do it using integers:
  
Start with 100 people.  10 will have the disease and 90 will not.  Of the 10 with the disease, 8 will test positive and 2 will test negative.  Of the 90 without the disease, 18 will test positive and 72% will test negative.  (72% = 0.8*90.)

<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog know about  the Bechdel test  for movies:
 
1. It has to have at least two women in it 
2. Who talk to each other 
3. About something besides a man
 
Amusing, huh?  But I only really got the point the other day, when I was on a plane and passively watched parts of the in-flight movie.  It was something I’d never heard of (of course) and it happened to be a chick flick–even without the soundtrack, it was clear that the main character was a woman and much of it was about her love life.  But even this movie failed the Bechdel test miserably!  I don’t even think it passed item #1 above, but if it did, it certainly failed #2.
 
If even the chick flicks are failing the Bechdel test, then, yeah, we’re really in trouble.  And don’t get me started on those old Warner Brothers cartoons.  They’re great but they feature about as many female characters as the average WWII submarine.  Sure, everybody knows this, but it’s still striking to think about just how unbalanced</p><p>3 0.79972237 <a title="351-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-Write_This_Book.html">1605 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-Write This Book</a></p>

If your first instinct is, “We should outlaw this test” or at lea</p><p>5 0.79696465 <a title="351-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-08-The_Case_for_More_False_Positives_in_Anti-doping_Testing.html">1612 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-08-The Case for More False Positives in Anti-doping Testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung was  ahead of the curve  on Lance Armstrong:
  
The media has gotten the statistics totally backwards.


On the one hand, they faithfully report the colorful stories of athletes who fail drug tests pleading their innocence. (I have written about the Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador here.) On the other hand, they unquestioningly report athletes who claim “hundreds of negative tests” prove their honesty. Putting these two together implies that the media believes that negative test results are highly reliable while positive test results are unreliable.


The reality is just the opposite. When an athlete tests positive, it’s almost sure that he/she has doped. Sure, most of the clean athletes will test negative but what is often missed is that the majority of dopers will also test negative.


We don’t need to do any computation to see that this is true. In most major sports competitions, the  proportion of tests declared positive is typically below 1%.

<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>2 0.95373529 <a title="351-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-The_Three_Golden_Rules_for_Successful_Scientific_Research.html">166 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>3 0.9309262 <a title="351-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-06-Research_Directions_for_Machine_Learning_and_Algorithms.html">747 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-06-Research Directions for Machine Learning and Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading  this  from John Langford:
  
The Deep Learning problem remains interesting. How do you effectively learn complex nonlinearities capable of better performance than a basic linear predictor? An effective solution avoids feature engineering. Right now, this is almost entirely dealt with empirically, but theory could easily have a role to play in phrasing appropriate optimization algorithms, for example.
  
Jimmy asks:
  
Does this sound related to modeling the deep interactions you often talk about?  (I [Jimmy] never understand the stuff on hunch, but thought that might be so?)
  
My reply:  I don’t understand that stuff on hunch so well either–he uses slightly different jargon than I do!  That said, it looks interesting and important so I’m pointing you all to it.</p><p>4 0.93077475 <a title="351-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious%3A_Why_We_Evolved_a_Taste_for_Being_Bad.html">1901 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>5 0.92968011 <a title="351-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-01-Separated_by_a_common_blah_blah_blah.html">2119 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-01-Separated by a common blah blah blah</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love reading the kind of English that English people write.  It’s the same language as American but just slightly different.  I was thinking about this recently after coming across this footnote from “Yeah Yeah Yeah:  The Story of Modern Pop,” by Bob Stanley:
  
Mantovani’s atmospheric arrangement on ‘Care Mia’, I should add, is something else.  Genuinely celestial.  If anyone with a degree of subtlety was singing, it would be quite a record.
  
It’s hard for me to pin down exactly what makes this passage specifically English, but there’s something about it . . .

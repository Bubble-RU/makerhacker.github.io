</p><p>9 So, to straighten things out:   This is not quite correct. [sent-20, score-0.065]
</p><p>10 He got the phrase backward:  It’s “colorless green ideas sleep furiously. [sent-22, score-0.825]
</p><p>11 ”   Chomsky used two examples:  “colorless green ideas sleep furiously” and “furiously sleep ideas green colorless. [sent-23, score-1.508]
</p><p>12 ”  The former set of words sounds like a sentence (even though it makes no sense), the latter does not sound like a sentence (and also does not make sense). [sent-24, score-0.776]
</p><p>13 It’s a very deliberate sequence of words, the reverse of a prhase that make perfect grammatical (or syntactic, I can never get these straight) sense. [sent-27, score-0.261]
</p><p>14 To use an analogy that James must be familiar with, “colorless green ideas” is like Jabberwocky–it  sounds  like English–all the parts of speech are in the right place. [sent-28, score-0.452]
</p><p>15 The difference, what makes the Chomsky sentence special, is that, first, the sentence makes no sense. [sent-29, score-0.518]
</p><p>16 But, beyond that,  any two successive words  of the sentence make no sense:  Something green cannot be colorless, an idea cannot be green, ideas do not sleep, and you cannot sleep furiously. [sent-30, score-1.175]

<p>Introduction: Noam Chomsky elicits a lot of emotional reactions.  I’ve talked with some linguists who think Chomsky’s been a real roadblock to research in recent decades.  Other linguists love Chomsky, but I think they’re the kind of linguists I wouldn’t spend much time talking with.  Many people admire Chomsky’s political activism, but sociologist blogger Fabio Rojas  distinguishes  “the Chomsky’s of the world who sit around and speechify about the man” from the good guys, “the academics whose work leads to tangible improvements.”
 
When Thomas Basbøll sent me this note,
  
I [Basbøll] wonder if you react in the same (sympathetic) way to  these  remarks by Chomsky [text  here ] as I do. I think he’s right that something happens to research when “applications” come into view. I like his distinction between two conceptions of science, one of which is based on “big data” in which patterns are found by brute information processing, and the other which requires the construction of simple, elegant models</p><p>3 0.2250316 <a title="168-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious%3A_Why_We_Evolved_a_Taste_for_Being_Bad.html">1901 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>4 0.13152465 <a title="168-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-06-Followup_questions.html">452 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-06-Followup questions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Upon returning from sabbatical I came across a few magazines from a year ago that I hadn’t gotten around to reading.  I’m thinking that I should read everything on a one-year delay.  The too-topical stuff (for example, promos tied to upcoming movies) I can ignore, and other items are enhanced by knowing what happened a year or two later.
 
For example, the 11 May 2009 issue of the New Yorker featured  an article  by Douglas McGray about an organization in Los Angeles called Green Dot that runs charter schools.  According to the article, Green Dot, unlike typical charter school operators, educate just about everyone in their schools’ areas and so don’t benefit so much from  selection .  I don’t know enough about the details to evaluate these claims, but I was curious about this bit:
  
[L.A. schools superintendent] Cortines has also agreed in principle to a partnership in Los Angeles. . . . Green Dot could take over as many as five Los Angeles schools in 2010, and maybe more.

<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone writes:
  
Probably not blog-worthy/blog-appropriate, but have you heard Bill James  discussing  the Sandusky & Paterno stuff?  I think you discussed once his stance on the Dowd Report, and this seems to be from the same part of his personality—which goes beyond contrarian . . .
  
I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.

<p>Introduction: In a review of the movie Moneyball, David Denby  writes : 
  
  
Lewis, Miller, and the screenwriters may have gone too far in their gleeful celebration of Beane and their denigration of scouts. Beane has never made it to the World Series (in 2002, the A’s were eliminated in the playoffs by the Minnesota Twins). Oakland has had a mediocre record for the past five years, and it’s finishing a lousy season this year. Success in baseball remains something of a mystery (though pots of money continue to help the Yankees and the Sox). Sabermetrics is a fascinating approach to winning, but it’s one of many approaches, not the ultimate answer. It can’t explain why some teams with the right stats catch fire and others fade. In the movie, the scouts say some dumb stuff, but they know that statistics, no matter how they’re broken down, can’t predict everything.
  
Denby generally likes the movie and is supportive of its message, so I shouldn’t really complain, but . . . the above passage is just s</p><p>3 0.78395629 <a title="168-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-Samurai_sword-wielding_Mormon_bishop_pharmaceutical_statistician_stops_mugger.html">1822 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-Samurai sword-wielding Mormon bishop pharmaceutical statistician stops mugger</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points us to  this  feel-good story of the day:
  
A Samurai sword-wielding Mormon bishop helped a neighbor woman escape a Tuesday morning attack by a man who had been stalking her.


Kent Hendrix woke up Tuesday to his teenage son pounding on his bedroom door and telling him somebody was being mugged in front of their house. The 47-year-old father of six rushed out the door and grabbed the weapon closest to him — a 29-inch high carbon steel Samurai sword. . . .


Hendrix, a pharmaceutical statistician, was one of several neighbors who came to the woman’s aid after she began yelling for help . . .
  
Too bad the whole “statistician” thing got buried in the middle of the article.  Fair enough, though:  I don’t know what it takes to become a Mormon bishop, but I assume it’s more effort than what it takes to learn statistics.</p><p>4 0.76096445 <a title="168-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-06-Calling_Jenny_Davidson_._._..html">1790 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-06-Calling Jenny Davidson . . .</a></p>

Claire Kirch  reports :
  
Lizzie Skurnick Books launches in September with the release of Debutante Hill by Lois Duncan. The novel, which was originally published by Dodd, Mead, in 1958, has been out of print for about three decades.


The other books on the initial list, all reissues, are A Long Day in November by Ernest J.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  discusses  his and Bryan Caplan’s reaction to that notorious book by Amy Chua, the Yale law professor who boasts of screaming at her children, calling them “garbage,” not letting them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano, etc.  Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel.  Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes).

After his (very clear) intro, he said that math talks were like action movies.

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>3 0.92016971 <a title="168-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-13-Against_the_myth_of_the_heroic_visualization.html">1896 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-13-Against the myth of the heroic visualization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.

<p>Introduction: I saw an analysis recently that I didn’t like.  I won’t go into the details, but basically it was a dose-response inference, where a continuous exposure was binned into three broad categories (terciles of the data) and the probability of an adverse event was computed for each tercile.  The effect and the sample size was large enough that the terciles were statistically-significantly different from each other in probability of adverse event, with the probabilities increasing from low to mid to high exposure, as one would predict.
 
I didn’t like this analysis because it is equivalent to fitting a step function.  There is a tendency for people to interpret the (arbitrary) tercile boundaries as being meaningful thresholds even though the underlying dose-response relation has to be continuous.  I’d prefer to start with a linear model and then add nonlinearity from there with a spline or whatever.
 
At this point I stepped back and thought:  Hey, the divide-into-three analysis does not lite</p><p>6 0.88106561 <a title="168-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-08-More_on_essentialism.html">1107 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-08-More on essentialism</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After seeing  this graph :
 
   
 
I have the following message for Sharad:
 
Rotate the graph 90 degrees so you can see the words.  Also you can ditch the lines.  Then what you have is a dotplot, following the principles of Cleveland (1985).  You can lay out a few on one page to see some interactions with demographics.
 
 The real challenge here . . . 
 
. . . is to automate this sort of advice.  Or maybe we just need a really nice dotplot() function and enough examples, and people will start doing it?
 
 P.S. 
 
Often a lineplot is better.  See  here  for a discussion of another Sharad example.</p><p>3 0.18908696 <a title="262-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.18278535 <a title="262-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-07-A_compelling_reason_to_go_to_London%2C_Ontario%3F%3F.html">1104 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-07-A compelling reason to go to London, Ontario??</a></p>

My reply:
 
It’s hard for me to imagine a compelling reason for anyone to go to London, Ontario–but, hey, I guess there’s all kinds of people in this world! More seriously, I see the appeal of the graph but it’s a bit busy for my taste.  Over the years I’ve moved toward small multiples rather than single busy graphs.  That’s one reason why I prefer Tufte’s second book to his first book.  The Napoleon-in-Russia graph is a bad model, in that inspires people to try to cram lots of variables on a single graph.

Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:
 
 
 
Here they decide to display only 5 states at a time so that it’s really hard to see any big pi</p><p>5 0.84724957 <a title="262-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-15-World_record_running_times_vs._distance.html">1011 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-15-World record running times vs. distance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Julyan Arbel  plots  world record running times vs. distance (on the log-log scale):
 
   
 
The line has a slope of 1.1.  I think it would be clearer to plot speed vs. distance—then you’d get a slope of -0.1, and the numbers would be more directly interpretable.
 
Indeed,  this paper  by Sandra Savaglio and Vincenzo Carbone (referred to in the comments on Julyan’s blog) plots speed vs. time.  Graphing by speed gives more resolution:
 
   
 
The upper-left graph in the grid corresponds to the human running records plotted by Arbel.  It’s funny that Arbel sees only one line whereas Savaglio and Carbone see two—but if you remove the 100m record at one end and the 100km at the other end, you can see two lines in Arbel’s graph as well.  The bottom two graphs show swimming records.   Knut  would probably have something to say about all this.</p><p>6 0.84291601 <a title="262-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Thinking_outside_the_%28graphical%29_box%3A__Instead_of_arguing_about_how_best_to_fix_a_bar_chart%2C_graph_it_as_a_time_series_lineplot_instead.html">294 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Thinking outside the (graphical) box:  Instead of arguing about how best to fix a bar chart, graph it as a time series lineplot instead</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 1.  I  remarked  that Sharad had a good research article with some ugly graphs.
 
2.  Dan  posted  Sharad’s graph and some unpleasant alternatives, inadvertently associating me with one of the unpleasant alternatives.  Dan was comparing barplots with dotplots.
 
3.  I  commented  on Dan’s site that, in this case, I’d much prefer a well-designed lineplot.  I wrote:
  
There’s a principle in decision analysis that the most important step is not the evaluation of the decision tree but the decision of what options to include in the tree in the first place.


I think that’s what’s happening here. You’re seriously limiting yourself by considering the above options, which really are all the same graph with just slight differences in format. What you need to do is break outside the box.

<p>Introduction: David Kaplan writes:
  
I came across your  paper  “Understanding Posterior Predictive P-values”, and I have a question regarding your statement “If a posterior predictive p-value is 0.4, say, that means that, if we believe the model, we think there is a 40% chance that tomorrow’s value of T(y_rep) will exceed today’s T(y).” This is perfectly understandable to me and represents the idea of calibration.  However, I am unsure how this relates to statements about fit.  If T is the LR chi-square or Pearson chi-square, then your statement that there is a 40% chance that tomorrows value exceeds today’s value indicates bad fit, I think.  Yet, some literature indicates that high p-values suggest good fit.  Could you clarify this?
  
My reply:
 
I think that “fit” depends on the question being asked.  In this case, I’d say the model fits for this particular purpose, even though it might not fit for other purposes.
 
And here’s the abstract of the paper:

In their March 9 “ counterpoint ” in nature biotech to the prospect that we should try to integrate more sources of data in clinical practice (see “ point ” arguing for this), Isaac Kohane and David Margulies claim that,


“Finally, how much better is our new knowledge than older knowledge? When is the incremental benefit of a genomic variant(s) or gene expression profile relative to a family history or classic histopathology insufficient and when does it add rather than subtract variance?”  


Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability. That is, if you have a hierarchical model, and the family history / classical histopathology already suggests a parameter estimate with some variance, how could the new genomic info possibly increase the variance of that parameter estimate? Surely the question is how much variance the new genomic info reduces and whether it therefore justifies t</p><p>4 0.9620502 <a title="262-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-07-X_on_JLP.html">1792 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-07-X on JLP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert  writes  on the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.  I have nothing to add to this beyond my recent  comments :
  
To me, the Lindley paradox falls apart because of its noninformative prior distribution on the parameter of interest. If you really think there’s a high probability the parameter is nearly exactly zero, I don’t see the point of the model saying that you have no prior information at all on the parameter. In short: my criticism of so-called Bayesian hypothesis testing is that it’s insufficiently Bayesian.


To clarify, I’m speaking of all the examples I’ve ever worked on in social and environmental science, where in some settings I can imagine a parameter being very close to zero and in other settings I can imagine a parameter taking on just about any value in a wide range, but where I’ve never seen an example where a parameter could be either right at zero or taking on any possible value. But such examples might occur in areas of application that I haven’t worked on.</p><p>5 0.96049565 <a title="262-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-25-An_interesting_but_flawed_attempt_to_apply_general_forecasting_principles_to_contextualize_attitudes_toward_risks_of_global_warming.html">2112 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-25-An interesting but flawed attempt to apply general forecasting principles to contextualize attitudes toward risks of global warming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

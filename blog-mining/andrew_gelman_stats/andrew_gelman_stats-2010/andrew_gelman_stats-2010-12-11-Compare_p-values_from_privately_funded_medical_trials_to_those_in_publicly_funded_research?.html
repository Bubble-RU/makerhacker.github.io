<p>Introduction: Interesting article  by Sharon Begley and Mary Carmichael.  They discuss how there is tons of federal support for basic research but that there’s a big gap between research findings and medical applications–a gap that, according to them, arises not just from the inevitable problem that not all research hypotheses pan out, but because actual promising potential cures don’t get researched because of the cost.
 
I have two thoughts on this.  First, in my experience, research at any level requires a continuing forward momentum, a push from  somebody  to keep it going.  I’ve worked on some great projects (some of which had Federal research funding) that ground to a halt because the original motivation died.  I expect this is true with medical research also.  One of the projects that I’m thinking of, which I’ve made almost no progress on for several years, I’m sure would make a useful contribution.  I pretty much know it would work–it just takes work to make it work, and it’s hard to do this</p><p>5 0.10495336 <a title="463-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-13-You_heard_it_here_first%3A_Intense_exercise_can_suppress_appetite.html">2022 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-13-You heard it here first: Intense exercise can suppress appetite</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
The New York Times recently ran an article entitled  “How Exercise Can Help Us Eat Less,”  which begins with this: “Strenuous exercise seems to dull the urge to eat afterward better than gentler workouts, several new studies show, adding to a growing body of science suggesting that intense exercise may have unique benefits.” The article is based on a couple of recent studies in which moderately overweight volunteers participated in different types of exercise, and had their food intake monitored at a subsequent meal.
 
The article also says “[The volunteers] also displayed significantly lower levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is known to stimulate appetite, and elevated levels of both blood lactate and blood sugar, which have been shown to lessen the drive to eat, after the most vigorous interval session than after the other workouts. And the appetite-suppressing effect of the highly intense intervals lingered into the next day, according to food diarie</p><p>6 0.1040514 <a title="463-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-28-Racism%21.html">1780 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-28-Racism!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone who works in statistics in the pharmaceutical industry (but prefers to remain anonymous) sent me  this update  to our discussion on the differences between approvals of drugs and medical devices:
  
The ‘substantial equivalence’ threshold is a very outdated. Basically the FDA has to follow federal law and the law is antiquated and leads to two extraordinarily different paths for device approval.


You could have a very simple but first-in-kind device with an easy to understand physiological mechanism of action (e.g. the FDA approved a simple tiny stent that would relieve pressure from a glaucoma patient’s eye this summer).  This device would require a standard (likely controlled) trial at the one-sided 0.025 level. Even after the trial it would likely go to a panel where outside experts (e.g.practicing & academic MDs and statisticians) hear evidence from the company and FDA and vote on its safety and efficacy.  FDA would then rule, consider the panel’s vote, on whether to appro</p><p>4 0.7129131 <a title="463-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-Why_don%E2%80%99t_more_medical_discoveries_become_cures%3F.html">167 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-Why don’t more medical discoveries become cures?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual 
 
If you’d like to learn more, the   Stan User’s Guide and Reference Manual   is the place to start.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94177806 <a title="463-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-11-Compare_p-values_from_privately_funded_medical_trials_to_those_in_publicly_funded_research%3F.html">463 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-11-Compare p-values from privately funded medical trials to those in publicly funded research?</a></p>

I just read the post on ethical concerns in medical trials. As there seems to be a lot more pressure on private researchers i thought it might be a nice little exercise to compare p-values from privately funded medical trials with those reported from publicly funded research, to see if confirmation pressure is higher in private research (i.e. p-values are closer to the cutoff levels for significance for the privately funded research). Do you think this is a decent idea or are you sceptical? Also are you aware of any sources listing a large number of representative medical studies and their type of funding?
  
My reply:
 
This sounds like something worth studying.  I don’t know where to get data about this sort of thing, but now that it’s been blogged, maybe someone will follow up.</p><p>3 0.92921484 <a title="463-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>4 0.92538458 <a title="463-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above is the title of  a talk  that Thad Tarpey gave at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2009.  Here’s the abstract:
  
Students of statistics are often introduced to George Box’s famous quote: “all models are wrong, some are useful.” In this talk I [Tarpey] argue that this quote, although useful, is wrong. A different and more positive perspective is to acknowledge that a model is simply a means of extracting information of interest from data. The truth is infinitely complex and a model is merely an approximation to the truth. If the approximation is poor or misleading, then the model is useless. In this talk I give examples of correct models that are not true models. I illustrate how the notion of a “wrong” model can lead to wrong conclusions.
  
I’m curious what he had to say—maybe he could post the slides?
 
P.S.  And  here they are !</p><p>5 0.9225812 <a title="463-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-15-Last_word_on_Mister_P_%28for_now%29.html">2062 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-15-Last word on Mister P (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>6 0.91878641 <a title="463-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-07-Whassup_with_phantom-limb_treatment%3F.html">457 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-07-Whassup with phantom-limb treatment?</a></p>

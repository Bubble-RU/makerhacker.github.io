I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:

In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.

</p><p>4 ” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred that renders them incapable of effectively opposing the murderous anti-Semitism of their enemies–and, by extension, the enemies of Israel. [sent-12, score-0.17]
</p><p>5 It is hard to imagine a less  fashionable  way of framing the debate over Israel, and even the most sympathetic reviewers of The Wicked Son frequently responded with sniffish dismay to Mamet’s line of argument. [sent-13, score-0.406]
</p><p>6 Setting aside the specific claims being made here (it would be hard for me to evaluate, for example, whether antisemitism was indeed “trendy” in 2002), I think Teachout made a mistake in his use of “trendy” and “fashionable. [sent-18, score-0.102]
</p><p>7 Or, to put it another way, everything’s trendy until it jumps the shark. [sent-21, score-0.323]
</p><p>8 ”  “Trendy” and “fashionable” are convenient negative words that don’t add much meaning–they’re a way to express contempt without taking the trouble to make an actual argument. [sent-23, score-0.173]
</p><p>9 My real trouble with the use of “fashionable” and “trendy” (and the accompanying implicit reasoning that goes along with them) is that they can get a writer tangled up in contradictions, without him even realizing it. [sent-25, score-0.138]
</p><p>10 After praising him for his “less fashionable” framing of the debate over Israel, Teachout turns to Mamet’s latest play, which he does not actually like very much:  “Alas, his first post-conversion play does not suggest that this new point of view has as yet borne interesting artistic fruit. [sent-27, score-0.365]
</p><p>11 ”  Teachout concludes his mini-review with the following sentence (parentheses in the original):    (The play has, interestingly, proved to be a major success at the box office. [sent-28, score-0.111]
</p><p>12 I can think of a few ways to interpret the parenthetical remark above:   - Theatergoers–unlike playwrights–are sensible Americans, middle-of-the-road politically, and welcome a fresh new play that does not take a politically-correct view of the world. [sent-32, score-0.157]
</p><p>13 This is a Hollywood-versus-America sort of argument and is consistent with the idea that we should trust the judgment of the market over that of a narrow spectrum of playwrights and critics. [sent-33, score-0.284]
</p><p>14 - On the other hand, Teachout  didn’t  actually like the play, so maybe he’s making an opposite argument, that theatergoers are, essentially, nothing but sheep who flock to anything by a big-name playwright. [sent-34, score-0.102]
</p><p>15 This is consistent with the idea that theaters can get away with all sorts of politically-correct crap and the audience won’t know the difference, thus a self-perpetuating mechanism that isolates theater away from the real life of America. [sent-35, score-0.213]
</p><p>16 The judgment of the market is always a double-edged sword, and it’s never clear whether popularity should be taken as a sign of virtue (“the free-market economy,” in Mamet’s words) or as a deplorable sign of conformity (recall those oh-so-trendy words, “trendy” and “fashionable”). [sent-37, score-0.245]
</p><p>17 Here’s another example  from a few months ago, an article about demographic trends that, again, got tangled from a need (as I see it) to be both popular and unpopular at the same time–to have the perceived virtues of mass support while being an embattled underdog. [sent-45, score-0.126]
</p><p>18 In the short term, perhaps we can all avoid the words “fashionable” and “trendy. [sent-46, score-0.149]

<p>Introduction: I read the following under the  headline , Behind a Flop, a Play(wright) Within a Play”:
  
A stroll down West 45th Street in the theater district is all it takes to understand the contradictory fortunes facing David Mamet, for years the heavyweight of bare-knuckled American playwrights, as well as the producers who believe that loyalty to the writer makes good business sense.


At the Schoenfeld Theater is Mr. Mamet’s latest box-office hit: A revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross,” his Pulitzer Prize-winning crowd-pleaser from 1984 about an office of desperately scheming salesmen. The producers are charging up to $377 a ticket simply on the drawing power of their star, Al Pacino, even before its official opening this weekend.
  
My first thought was, Cool!  Mamet wrote a new play called “A revival of ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’” with a play within a play.
 
My second thought was, No way am I paying $377 a ticket for this.  Too bad it’s not more reasonably priced.

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitztein sent around the following graph:
 
 
 
(The x-axis goes from 2000 to 2012 and the y=axis goes from 0 to 120.)
 
100 statistics majors (this combines sophomores, juniors, and seniors, but still, that’s a lot more than the 1 or 2 or 3 a year we’re used to seeing).  At first I was like, whoa!  But then I thought, why  not  100 or even 200 or 300 statistics majors?  Statistics is important in itself, it’s relatively easy as far as quantitative majors go, it’s applicable to lots of other areas.  The real question should be not, What’s been happening that’s made statistics so trendy lately? but rather, What took so long for this to happen, and why isn’t statistics more popular?  Both places where I studied as an undergraduate, statistics was just a subset of the math department, and maybe the only reason I ended up in statistics is that I took a probability course one semester because, at 5pm, it fit my schedule.</p><p>5 0.078510702 <a title="189-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-12-That_claim_that_Harvard_admissions_discriminate_in_favor_of_Jews%3F__After_seeing_the_statistics%2C_I_don%E2%80%99t_see_it..html">1720 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-12-That claim that Harvard admissions discriminate in favor of Jews?

<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school.

<p>Introduction: The pre-NYT David Brooks liked to make fun of the NYT.  Here’s one  from 1997 :
  
I’m not sure I’d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I’d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.


And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man—Thomas Arena—who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .


These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan’s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  reports  on the sympathy that well-known physicist Freeman Dyson has with crackpot theorists.  The interesting part is that Dyson has positive feelings for these cranks,  even while believing that their theories are completely wrong :
  
In my [Dyson's] career as a scientist, I twice had the good fortune to be a personal friend of a famous dissident. One dissident, Sir Arthur Eddington, was an insider like Thomson and Tait. The other, Immanuel Velikovsky, was an outsider like Carter. Both of them were tragic figures, intellectually brilliant and morally courageous, with the same fatal flaw as Carter. Both of them were possessed by fantasies that people with ordinary common sense could recognize as nonsense. I made it clear to both that I did not believe their fantasies, but I admired them as human beings and as imaginative artists. I admired them most of all for their stubborn refusal to remain silent. With the whole world against them, they remained true to their beliefs.</p><p>5 0.84356374 <a title="189-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-18-Never_back_down%3A__The_culture_of_poverty_and_the_culture_of_journalism.html">2337 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-18-Never back down:  The culture of poverty and the culture of journalism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ta-Nehisi Coates recently published  a fascinating column  on the “culture of poverty,” in particular focusing on the idea that behavior that is rational and adaptive in some settings is not so appropriate in others:
  
The set of practices required for a young man to secure his safety on the streets of his troubled neighborhood are not the same as those required to place him on an honor roll . . . The way to guide him through this transition is not to insult his native language. . . .


For black men like us, the feeling of having something to lose, beyond honor and face, is foreign. We grew up in communities—New York, Baltimore, Chicago—where the Code of the Streets was the first code we learned. Respect and reputation are everything there. These values are often denigrated by people who have never been punched in the face. But when you live around violence there is no opting out. A reputation for meeting violence with violence is a shield. That protection increases when you are part</p><p>6 0.84331042 <a title="189-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-How_to_think_about_Lou_Dobbs.html">335 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-How to think about Lou Dobbs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I’d share an old story.
 
About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>2 0.91747129 <a title="189-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.


Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users can learn and p</p><p>3 0.91109055 <a title="189-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">1119 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>5 0.84828562 <a title="189-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-28-When_Small_Numbers_Lead_to_Big_Errors.html">434 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-28-When Small Numbers Lead to Big Errors</a></p>

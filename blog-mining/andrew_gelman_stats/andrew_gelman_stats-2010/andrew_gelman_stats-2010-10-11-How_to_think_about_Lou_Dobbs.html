<p>Introduction: As many of you know, this blog is on an approximate one-month delay.  I schedule my posts to appear roughly once a day, and there’s currently a backlog of about 20 or 30 posts.
 
Recently I’ve decided to spend less time blogging, but I have some ideas I’d still like to share.  To tweet, if you will.  So I thought I’d just put a bunch of ideas out there that interested readers could follow up on.  Think of it like one of those old-style dot-dot-dot newspaper columns.
  

 
- One thing statisticians could learn from economists:  if you want to control for a continuous variable, throw it in as a fifth-order polynomial on the right hand side of a regression.  A lot of statisticians will either do simple linear or else spaz out with a spline.  But good old polynomials are fine.
 
- One thing that not so many political scientists realize is that nowadays the rich voters are Democrats!  You don’t always see that in surveys, but remember that survey nonresponse rates are typically 80%+.  Heck,</p><p>3 0.060220111 <a title="335-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-24-Hey%E2%80%94has_anybody_done_this_study_yet%3F.html">1546 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-24-Hey—has anybody done this study yet?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  suggested  a research project to study how Americans define themselves in terms of regional identity.  For example, if you grew up in South Dakota but live in Washington, D.C., do you you call yourself a midwesterner, a westerner, a southerner, or what?  The analogy is to the paper by Michael Hout on “How 4 million Irish immigrants became 40 million Irish Americans.” Contrary to expectations, it wasn’t about prolific breeding, it was about how people of mixed background choose to classify themselves.</p><p>4 0.054929264 <a title="335-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-22-Tenants_and_landlords.html">158 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-22-Tenants and landlords</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.
 
2.  A year after I graduated, the landlord actually did sell the place but then, when my friends moved out, he refused to pay back their security deposit.  There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.  So they sued the landlord in Mass. housing court</p><p>5 0.049224131 <a title="335-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-19-%E2%80%9CIf_it_saves_the_life_of_a_single_child%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D_and_other_nonsense.html">526 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-19-“If it saves the life of a single child…” and other nonsense</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
An Oregon legislator, Mitch Greenlick, has  proposed to make it illegal  in Oregon to carry a child under six years old on one’s bike (including in a child seat) or in a bike trailer.  The guy says “”We’ve just done a study showing that 30 percent of riders biking to work at least three days a week have some sort of crash that leads to an injury… When that’s going on out there, what happens when you have a four year old on the back of a bike?”  The study is from Oregon Health Sciences University, at which the legislator is a professor. 
 
Greenlick also says “”If it’s true that it’s unsafe, we have an obligation to protect people. If I thought a law would save one child’s life, I would step in and do it. Wouldn’t you?”
 
There are two statistical issues here.  The first is in the category of “lies, damn lies, and statistics,” and involves the statement about how many riders have injuries.  As quoted on  a blog ,  the author of the study in question says th</p><p>6 0.048419751 <a title="335-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-07-Valencia%3A___Summer_of_1991.html">72 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-07-Valencia:   Summer of 1991</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>3 0.84657747 <a title="335-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-10-The_last_great_essayist%3F.html">197 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-10-The last great essayist?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>4 0.84177434 <a title="335-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-22-Tenants_and_landlords.html">158 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-22-Tenants and landlords</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>4 0.84807265 <a title="335-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Applied_Statistics_Center_miniconference%3A__Statistical_sampling_in_developing_countries.html">359 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Applied Statistics Center miniconference:  Statistical sampling in developing countries</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>6 0.80964804 <a title="335-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-%28Partisan%29_visualization_of_health_care_legislation.html">178 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-(Partisan) visualization of health care legislation</a></p>

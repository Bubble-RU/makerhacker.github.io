<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .

<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:

<p>Introduction: There’s this idea called “domain specificity” that I learned from my sister many years ago:  it’s the idea that a skill might work in some domains but not others. For example, knowing (some) Spanish helps a bit with my French but it doesn’t do anything for my Chinese.  Traditionally in psychometrics, this sort of thing is studied using correlation–scores on various math tests are highly correlated with each other, and these are also correlated (but less so) with scores on English tests.  Michael Jordan would probably be good at just about any sport he tried (even if he couldn’t quite hit the curveball).  Top actors can typically sing, dance, do magic, etc.–they’re great all-around performers.  And so on.

<p>Introduction: . . . they’re  not  in awe of economists.
 
In contrast, economists sometimes treat each other with the soft bigotry of low expectations.  For example, here’s Brad DeLong in defense of Larry Summers:
  
[During a 2005 meeting, Summers] said that in a modern economy with sophisticated financial markets we were likely to have more and bigger financial crises than we had before, just as the worst modern transportation accidents are worse than the worst transportation accidents back in horse-and-buggy days. . . . Indeed, for twenty years one of Larry’s conversation openers has been: “You really should write something else good on positive-feedback trading and its dangers for financial markets.”
  
That’s fine, but, hey, I’ve been going around saying this for many years too, and I’m not even an economist (although I did get an A in the last econ class I took, which was in eleventh grade).   Lots and lots of people  have been talking for years about the dangers of positive feedback, the risk</p><p>2 0.90342307 <a title="431-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi_Google_search_est_devenu_plus_raisonnable%3F.html">207 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-14-Pourquoi Google search est devenu plus raisonnable?</a></p>

Several commenters gave informed discussions about what was going on in Google’s program.
 
Maybe things are better now, though?  The latest version seems much more reasonable:

<p>Introduction: In  our new ethics column for Chance , Eric Loken and I write about our current favorite topic:
  
One of our ongoing themes when discussing scientific ethics is the central role of statistics in recognizing and communicating uncer- 
tainty. Unfortunately, statistics—and the scientific process more generally—often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. . . .


We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages—that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty—were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a</p><p>4 0.89803958 <a title="431-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-06-Josh_Tenenbaum_presents_._._._a_model_of_folk_physics%21.html">994 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-06-Josh Tenenbaum presents . . . a model of folk physics!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Josh Tenenbaum describes some new work modeling people’s physical reasoning as probabilistic inferences over intuitive theories of mechanics. 
  
A general-purpose capacity for “physical intelligence”—inferring physical properties of objects and predicting future states in complex dynamical scenes—is central to how humans interpret their environment and plan safe and effective actions.  The computations and representations underlying physical intelligence remain unclear, however. Cognitive studies have focused on mapping out judgment biases and errors, or on testing simple heuristic models suitable only for highly specific cases; they have not attempted to give general-purpose unifying models.  In computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics researchers have long sought to formalize common-sense physical reasoning but without success in approaching human-level competence.  Here we show that a wide range of human physical judgments can be explained by positing an “intuitive me</p><p>5 0.89676601 <a title="431-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-17-Replication_backlash.html">2137 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-17-Replication backlash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Raghuveer Parthasarathy pointed me to an article in Nature by Mina Bissell, who  writes , “The push to replicate findings could shelve promising research and unfairly damage the reputations of careful, meticulous scientists.”
 
I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

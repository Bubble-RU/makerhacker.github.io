<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.10556541 <a title="130-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-13-Retractions%2C_retractions%3A__%E2%80%9Cleft-wing_enough_to_not_care_about_truth_if_it_confirms_their_social_theories%2C_right-wing_enough_to_not_care_as_long_as_they%E2%80%99re_getting_paid_enough%E2%80%9D.html">1415 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-13-Retractions, retractions:  “left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two news items.
 
1.  A couple people pointed me to the  uncovering  of another fraudulent Dutch psychology researcher—this time it was Dirk Smeesters, rather than  Diederik Stapel .  It’s hard to keep these guys straight—they all pretty much have the same names and do the same things.
 
Stapel and Smeesters also seem to live in the same postmodernist/business-school nexus:  left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough.
 
In the comments to the Retraction Watch post, Richard Gill  writes , “it looks to me [Gill] like Smeesters was subjected to medieval torture and confessed.”  Medieval torture, huh?  I haven’t seen Holy Grail in many years but I recall that’s pretty rough stuff, of the sort that even John Yoo might think twice about.  I followed the links and didn’t see what the torture was, but I have to admit I didn’t even try to read the Dutch documents.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  my post  responding to his question about that controversial claim that high genetic diversity, or low genetic diversity, is bad for the economy, Kyle Peyton writes:
  
I’m happy to see you’ve articulated similar gripes I had w/ the piece, which makes me feel like I’m not crazy. I remember discussing this with colleagues (I work at a research institute w/ economists) and only a couple of them shared any concern. It seems that by virtue of being published in ‘the AER’ the results are unquestionable. I agree that the idea is interesting and worth pursuing but as you say it’s one thing to go from that to asserting ‘causality’ (I still don’t know what definition of causality they’re using?). All the data torture along the way is just tipping the hat to convention rather than serving any scientific purpose.
  
Some researchers are so uptight about identification that, when they think they have it, all their skepticism dissolves.

<p>Introduction: Respected political scientist Tim Groseclose just came out with a book, “Left Turn:  How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.”  I was familiar with Groseclose’s article (with Jeffrey Milyo) on media bias that came out several years ago–it was an interesting study but I was not convinced by its central claim that they were measuring an absolute level of bias–and then recently heard about this new book in the context of some  intemperate  things Groseclose said in a interview on the conservative Fox TV network.
 
Groseclose’s big conclusion is that in the absence of media bias, the average American voter would be positioned at around 25 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is a right-wing Republican and 100 is a left-wing Democrat.  (Seeing as the number line is conventionally drawn from left to right, I think it would make more sense for 0 to represent the left and 100 to be on the right, but I guess it’s too late for him to change now.)  Groseclose places the average voter now at around</p><p>3 0.7899729 <a title="130-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>4 0.75379634 <a title="130-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-20-No_no_no_no_no.html">1020 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-20-No no no no no</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.  The disturbing thing about the whole process wasn’t so much that the Tea Partiers were irrational as that th</p><p>5 0.75096029 <a title="130-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-17-%E2%80%9Cthe_Tea_Party%E2%80%99s_ire%2C_directed_at_Democrats_and_Republicans_alike%E2%80%9D.html">521 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-17-“the Tea Party’s ire, directed at Democrats and Republicans alike”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Lilla recalls some recent Barack Obama quotes and then  writes :
  
If this is the way the president and his party think about human psychology, it’s little wonder they’ve taken such a beating.
  
In the spirit of that old line, “That and $4.95 will get you a tall latte,” let me agree with Lilla and attribute the Democrats’ losses in 2010 to the following three factors:
 
1.  A poor understanding of human psychology;
 
2.  The Democrats holding unified control of the presidency and congress with a large majority in both houses (factors that are historically associated with big midterm losses); and
 
3.  A terrible economy.
 
I will let you, the readers, make your best guesses as to the relative importance of factors 1, 2, and 3 above.
 
Don’t get me wrong:  I think psychology is important, as is the history of ideas (the main subject of Lilla’s article), and I’d hope that Obama (and also his colleagues in both parties in congress) can become better acquainted with psychology, moti</p><p>6 0.75018847 <a title="130-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-Obama_and_Reagan%2C_sitting_in_a_tree%2C_etc..html">551 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-Obama and Reagan, sitting in a tree, etc.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

<p>Introduction: John Sides  reports  on  this finding  by Paul Gronke, Darius Rejali, Dustin Drenguis, James Hicks, Peter Miller, and Bryan Nakayama, from a survey in 2008::
 
   
 
Gronke et al. write (as excerpted by Sides):
  
Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.
  
Gronke et al. attribute confusion of beliefs to the so-called false consensus effect studied by cognitive psychologists, in which people tend to assume th</p><p>4 0.89521348 <a title="130-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-17-NUTS_discussed_on_Xi%E2%80%99an%E2%80%99s_Og.html">1809 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-17-NUTS discussed on Xi’an’s Og</a></p>

We also found that capital punishment used to be more popular in the Northeast than in the South, but now it’s the other way around.
 
Here’s the abstract to  our paper :
  
One of the longest running questions that has been regularly included in Gallup’s national public opinion poll is “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Because the death penalty is governed by state laws rather than federal laws, it is of special interest to know how public opinion varies by state, and how it has changed over time within each state. In this paper we combine dozens of national polls taken over a fifty-year span and fit a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to individual response data to estimate changes in state-level public opinion over time. Such a long span of polls has not been analyzed this way before, partly</p><p>3 0.14393218 <a title="284-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-07-Minor-league_Stats_Predict_Major-league_Performance%2C_Sarah_Palin%2C_and_Some_Differences_Between_Baseball_and_Politics.html">652 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-07-Minor-league Stats Predict Major-league Performance, Sarah Palin, and Some Differences Between Baseball and Politics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:
  
Palin’s magic formula for success has been simply to ignore partisan crap and get</p><p>4 0.13921565 <a title="284-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine. The Holiday Inn testing facility was the largest in North America, and had been operating for nearly ten years before inspecto</p><p>5 0.10628776 <a title="284-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.10447115 <a title="284-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-19-Is_coffee_a_killer%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_the_effect_is_as_high_as_was_estimated_from_the_highest_number_that_came_out_of_a_noisy_study.html">2030 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-19-Is coffee a killer?

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Someone who works in statistics in the pharmaceutical industry (but prefers to remain anonymous) sent me  this update  to our discussion on the differences between approvals of drugs and medical devices:
  
The ‘substantial equivalence’ threshold is a very outdated. Basically the FDA has to follow federal law and the law is antiquated and leads to two extraordinarily different paths for device approval.


You could have a very simple but first-in-kind device with an easy to understand physiological mechanism of action (e.g. the FDA approved a simple tiny stent that would relieve pressure from a glaucoma patient’s eye this summer).  This device would require a standard (likely controlled) trial at the one-sided 0.025 level. Even after the trial it would likely go to a panel where outside experts (e.g.practicing & academic MDs and statisticians) hear evidence from the company and FDA and vote on its safety and efficacy.  FDA would then rule, consider the panel’s vote, on whether to appro</p><p>4 0.75347495 <a title="284-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Massive_confusion_about_a_study_that_purports_to_show_that_exercise_may_increase_heart_risk.html">1364 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Massive confusion about a study that purports to show that exercise may increase heart risk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan  gives the story .
 
Here’s Sarah Palin’s statement introducing the now-notorious phrase:
  
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s “death panel” so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.
  
And now Brendan:
  
Palin’s language suggests that a “death panel” would determine whether individual patients receive care based on their “level of productivity in society.” This was — and remains — false. Denying coverage at a system level for specific treatments or drugs is not equivalent to “decid[ing], based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society.’”
  
Seems like an open-and-shut case to me.  The “bureaucrats” (I think Palin is referring to “government employees”) are making decisions based on studies of the drug’s effectiveness:

<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>3 0.94091839 <a title="284-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-10-Small_multiples_of_lineplots_%3E_maps_%28ok%2C_not_always%2C_but_yes_in_this_case%29.html">2288 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-10-Small multiples of lineplots > maps (ok, not always, but yes in this case)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung shares  this graph  from Ritchie King:
 
 
 
Kaiser writes:
  
What they did right:


- Did not put the data on a map 
- Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically 
- Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel 
- Only used three labels for the 11 years on the plot 
- Did not overdo the vertical scale either


The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go. I would have used smaller fonts throughout.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s comments. I could even add a few more, like using light gray for the backgrounds and a bright blue for the lines, spacing the graphs well, using full country names rather than three-letter abbreviations. There are so many standard mistakes that go into default data displays that it is refreshing to see a simple graph done</p><p>4 0.93902028 <a title="284-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-03-The_saber_saw%2C_the_ashtray%2C_and_other_stories_of_misbehaving_profs.html">644 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-03-The saber saw, the ashtray, and other stories of misbehaving profs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This recent story  of a wacky psychology professor reminds me of  this old story  of a wacky psychology professor.
 
 This story  of a wacky philosophy professor reminds me of a course I almost took at MIT.  I was looking through the course catalog one day and saw that Thomas Kuhn was teaching a class in the philosophy of science.  Thomas Kuhn–wow!  So I enrolled in the class.  I only sat through one session before dropping it, though.  Kuhn just stood up there and mumbled.
 
At the time, this annoyed me a little.  In retrospect, though, it made more sense.  I’m sure he felt he had better things to do with his life than teach classes.  And MIT was paying him whether or not he did a good job teaching, so it’s not like he was breaking his contract or anything.  (Given the range of instructors we had at MIT, it was always a good idea to make use of the shopping period at the beginning of the semester.  I had some amazing classes but only one or two really bad ones.  Mostly I dropped the b</p><p>5 0.93859482 <a title="284-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-03-As_the_boldest_experiment_in_journalism_history%2C_you_admit_you_made_a_mistake.html">2280 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-03-As the boldest experiment in journalism history, you admit you made a mistake</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The pre-NYT David Brooks liked to make fun of the NYT.  Here’s one  from 1997 :
  
I’m not sure I’d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I’d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.


And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man—Thomas Arena—who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .


These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan’s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.

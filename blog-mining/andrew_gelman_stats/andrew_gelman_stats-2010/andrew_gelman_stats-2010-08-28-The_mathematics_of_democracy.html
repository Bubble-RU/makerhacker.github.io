<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.12206443 <a title="239-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live.

<p>Introduction: I was sent a copy of “Numbers Rule:  The Vexing Mathematics of Democracy, from Plato to the Present,” by George Szpiro.  It’s an interesting book that I think a lot of people will like, going over a bunch of voting paradoxes in the context of historical stories.  Some of the topics (Arrow’s theorem and its recent refinements) are more interesting than others (the always nauseatingly boring (to me) of the “Alabama paradox” and various rules about which states get one extra House seat; for some reason people are always writing about this topic about which I could care less).  But you can pick and choose among the chapters, so unevenness isn’t really such a problem.

<p>Introduction: I’ve always thought it looked strange to see people referred to in print as Black or White rather than black or white.  For example consider this sentence:  “A black guy was walking down the street and he saw a bunch of white guys standing around.”  That looks fine, whereas “A Black guy was walking down the street and he saw a bunch of White guys standing around”—that looks weird to me, as if the encounter was taking place in an Ethnic Studies seminar.
 
But maybe I’m wrong on this.  Jay Livingston  argues  that black and white are colors whereas Black and White are races (or, as I would prefer to say, ethnic categories) and illustrates with this picture of a white person and a White person:
 
   
 
In conversation, I sometimes talk about pink people, brown people, and tan people, but that won’t work in a research paper.
 
P.S.  I suspect Carp will argue that I’m being naive:  meanings of words change across contexts and over time.

<p>Introduction: This  story  (“Yale tells students to keep Kissinger talk secret . . . ‘Dr. Kissinger’s visit to campus will not be publicized, so we appreciate your confidentiality…’”) reminds me of two things:
 
- In the 1980s, I once went to a public lecture at Harvard by Kissinger protogé Ted Koppel, who indeed has that deep Ted Koppel voice even when he’s just chatting (as I overheard).  Koppel insisted that the contents of his talk not be reported.  It was no great loss; he didn’t really have anything newsworthy to say.  The talk was fine, he told us some interesting things, just nothing that would’ve made the news or even the campus newspaper.  Still, it seemed kinda tacky for a reporter whose shtick was access to the powerful, to not want his own speech to be reported. 
 
- In the 1990s, a colleague of mine in a different dept told us that this professor from another university was coming by to give a lecture.  I told my colleague that I’d like to meet with the guy, as I wanted to ask his opin</p><p>4 0.78440624 <a title="239-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.

<p>Introduction: I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I’d share an old story.
 
About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>2 0.95131755 <a title="239-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.


Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users can learn and p</p><p>3 0.94866973 <a title="239-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Proposal_for_a_moratorium_on_the_use_of_the_words_%E2%80%9Cfashionable%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Ctrendy%E2%80%9D.html">189 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Proposal for a moratorium on the use of the words “fashionable” and “trendy”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>4 0.9449572 <a title="239-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">1119 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association is seeking nominations for its annual  Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award .  The award was created in 2004 to encourage and recognize members of the communications media who have best displayed an informed interest in the science of statistics and its role in public life. The award can be given for a single statistical article or for a body of work.
 
Former winners of the award include:  Felix Salmon , financial blogger, 2010;  Sharon Begley , Newsweek, 2009; Mark Buchanan, New York Times, 2008; John Berry, Bloomberg News, 2005; and Gina Kolata, New York Times, 2004.
 
If anyone has any suggestions for the 2012 award, feel free to post in the comments or email me.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.9273901 <a title="239-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-28-The_mathematics_of_democracy.html">239 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-28-The mathematics of democracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was sent a copy of “Numbers Rule:  The Vexing Mathematics of Democracy, from Plato to the Present,” by George Szpiro.  It’s an interesting book that I think a lot of people will like, going over a bunch of voting paradoxes in the context of historical stories.  Some of the topics (Arrow’s theorem and its recent refinements) are more interesting than others (the always nauseatingly boring (to me) of the “Alabama paradox” and various rules about which states get one extra House seat; for some reason people are always writing about this topic about which I could care less).  But you can pick and choose among the chapters, so unevenness isn’t really such a problem.
 
One thing that fascinates me about the topic of mathematics and representation is how many different ways there are to look at it.
  

 
In 2002, I published a paper in Chance called Voting, Fairness, and Political Representation ( here’s a preprint version ; it later appeared, slightly revised, as a chapter in our  Quantita</p><p>6 0.92733943 <a title="239-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-28-When_Small_Numbers_Lead_to_Big_Errors.html">434 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-28-When Small Numbers Lead to Big Errors</a></p>

Akinola Modupe and Katherine Milkman responded to  my email  about  their study :
  
We want to clarify the reason we believe that the use of deception and a lack of informed consent were appropriate and ethical for this research study. In this project, we were studying how the timing of a decision affects discrimination based on race and/or gender.  The emails all participants in our study received were identical except for a) the sender’s name (we used 20 names that pretesting revealed were strongly associated with being either Caucasian, Black, Indian, Chinese or Hispanic, as well as associated with being male or female) and b) whether the meeting requested was for today or for a week from today.  Recipients were randomly selected and were randomly assigned to one of the race/gender/timing conditions.

<p>Introduction: Around the time I was finishing up my Ph.D. thesis, I was trying to come up with a good title–something more grabby than “Topics in Image Reconstruction for Emission Tomography”–and one of the other students said:  How about something iike, Female Mass Murderers:  Babes Behind Bars?  That sounded good to me, and I was all set to use it.  I had a plan:  I’d first submit the one the boring title–that’s how it would be recorded in all the official paperwork–but then at the last minute I’d substitute in the new title page before submitting to the library.  (This was in the days of hard copies.)  Nobody would look at the time, then later on, if anyone went into the library to find my thesis, they’d have a pleasant surprise.  Anyway, as I said, I was all set to do this, but a friend warned me off.  He said that at some point, someone might find it, and the rumor would spread that I’m a sexist pig.  So I didn’t.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko points me to a  news article  by Zack Beauchamp on Jason Richwine, the recent Ph.D. graduate from Harvard’s policy school who left the conservative Heritage Foundation after it came out that his Ph.D. thesis was said to be all  about  the low IQ’s of Hispanic immigrants.  Heritage and  others  apparently thought this association could discredit their anti-immigration-reform position.  Richwine’s mentor Charles Murray was  unhappy  about the whole episode.
 
Beauchamp’s article is worth reading in that it provides some interesting background, in particular by getting into the details of the Ph.D. review process.  In a sense, Beauchamp is too harsh.  Flawed Ph.D. theses get published all the time.  I’d say that  most  Ph.D. theses I’ve seen are flawed:  usually the plan is to get the papers into shape later, when submitting them to journals.  If a student doesn’t go into academia, the thesis typically just sits there and is rarely followed up on.

<p>Introduction: Journalist Jonathan Rauch  writes  that the internet is Sturgeon squared:
  
This is the blogosphere. I’m not getting paid to be here. I’m here to get incredibly famous (in my case, even more incredibly famous) so that I can get paid somewhere else. . . .


The average quality of newspapers and (published) novels is far, far better than the average quality of blog posts (and–ugh!–comments). This is because people pay for newspapers and novels. What distinguishes newspapers and novels is how much does not get published in them, because people won’t pay for it. Payment is a filter, and a pretty good one. Imperfect, of course. But pointing out the defects of the old model is merely changing the subject if the new model is worse. . . .


Yes, the new model is bringing a lot of new content into being. But most of it is bad. And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. Even in the information economy, there’s no free lunch. . . .

<p>Introduction: I was thinking a bit more about  Jonathan Rauch’s lament  about the fading of  the buggy-whip industry  print journalism, in which he mocks bloggers, analogizes blogging to scribbling with spray paint on the side of a building, and writes that the blogosphere is “the single worst medium for sustained, and therefore grown-up, reading and writing and argumentation ever invented.”
 
Yup.  Worse than talk radio.  Worse than cave painting.  Worse than smoke signals, rock ‘n’ roll lyrics, woodcuts, spray-paint graffiti, and every other medium of communication ever invented.
 
OK, he didn’t really mean it.  Rauch actually has an ironclad argument here.  He’s claiming, in a blog, that blogging is crap.  Therefore, if he fills his blog with unsupported exaggerations, that’s fine, as he’s demonstrating that blogging is . . . crap.
 
Not to pile on, but, hey, why not?  I was curious what Rauch has blogged on lately, so I googled Jonathan Rauch blog and ended up at  this site , which most recently</p><p>4 0.79689795 <a title="458-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-26-Tweeting_the_Hits%3F.html">1084 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-26-Tweeting the Hits?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email saying that he liked my little essay, “Descriptive statistics aren’t just for losers.”  I had no idea what he was talking about, but it sounded like the kind of thing I’d say, so I searched the blog and found  this post , which indeed I really like!
 
I thanked my correspondent for reminding me of this little article I’d forgotten, and he told me he just learned of it via someone’s tweet.
 
This made me think:  Maybe I should have a twitter feed of nothing but old blog entries.  I could just go back to 2004 and then go gradually forward, tweeting the items that I judge to remain of interest.
 
Does this make sense?  Or is there a better way to do this?  ALternatively, I could do it as a separate blog, but that seems a bit . . . recursive.</p><p>5 0.79482603 <a title="458-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-31-Why_Edit_Wikipedia%3F.html">640 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-31-Why Edit Wikipedia?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Zoe Corbyn’s article for  The Guardian  (UK), titled  Wikipedia wants more contributions from academics , and the followup  discussion on Slashdot  got me thinking about my own Wikipedia edits.  
 
The article quotes Dario Taraborelli, a research analyst for the Wikimedia Foundation, as saying “Academics are trapped in this paradox of using Wikipedia but not contributing,”  Huh?  I’m really wondering what man-in-the-street wrote all the great stats stuff out there.  And what’s the paradox?  I use lots of things without contributing to them.  
 
Taraborelli is further quoted as saying “The Wikimedia Foundation is looking at how it might capture expert conversation about Wikipedia content happening on other websites and feed it back to the community as a way of providing pointers for improvement.”
 
This struck home.  I recently went through the entry for  latent Dirichlet allocation  and found a bug in their derivation.  I wrote up a revised derivation and  posted it on my own blog .</p><p>6 0.78955293 <a title="458-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-23-My_new_writing_strategy.html">727 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-23-My new writing strategy</a></p>

I [Kane] am involved in a dispute relating to whether or not a blog can be considered part of one’s academic writing.  Williams College restricts the use of undergraduate theses as follows:

 
Non-commercial, academic use within the scope of “Fair Use” standards is acceptable. Otherwise, you may not copy or distribute any content without the permission of the copyright holder.
 

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.
      
Parenthetically, your readers might be interested in the substantive discovery here, the details of the Williams admissions process (which is probably very similar to Columbia’s). Williams places students into academic rating (AR) categories as follows:

<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):
 
   
 
Anyway, with all this, I was primed to be interested in a recent  study  by psychologist</p><p>3 0.92646343 <a title="458-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-03-Is_Harvard_hurting_poor_kids_by_cutting_tuition_for_the_upper_middle_class%3F.html">598 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-03-Is Harvard hurting poor kids by cutting tuition for the upper middle class?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Timothy Noah  reports :
  
At the end of 2007, Harvard announced that it would limit tuition to no more than 10 percent of family income for families earning up to $180,000. (It also eliminated all loans, following a trail blazed by Princeton, and stopped including home equity in its calculations of family wealth.) Yale saw and raised to $200,000, and other wealthy colleges weighed in with variations.
  
Noah argues that this is a bad thing because it encourages other colleges to give tuition breaks to families with six-figure incomes, thus sucking up money that could otherwise go to reduce tuition for lower-income students.  For example:
  
Roger Lehecka, a former dean of students at Columbia, and Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies there, wrote in the New York Times that Harvard’s initiative was “good news for students at Harvard or Yale” but “bad news” for everyone else. “The problem,” they explained, “is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale’s</p><p>4 0.92285562 <a title="458-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-13-Update_on_marathon_statistics.html">273 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-13-Update on marathon statistics</a></p>

2. include a proxy for [non] newbies — whether I can find their name in a previous Chicago Marathon.


3. graph actual pace vs. fitted pace (color code newbie proxy)


4. estimate the model separately for newbies and non-newbies.


some incidental discussion of sd of errors.

<p>Introduction: This came in the spam the other day:
  
College Station, TX–August 16, 2010–Change and hope were central themes to the November 2008 U.S. presidential election. A new longitudinal study published in the September issue of  Social Science Quarterly   analyzes suicide rates at a state level from 1981ï¼2005 and determines that presidential election outcomes directly influence suicide rates among voters.


In states where the majority of voters supported the national election winner suicide rates decreased. However, counter-intuitively, suicide rates decreased even more dramatically in states where the majority of voters supported the election loser (4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 lower for females). This article is the first in its field to focus on candidate and state-specific outcomes in relation to suicide rates. Prior research on this topic focused on whether the election process itself influenced suicide rates, and found that suicide rates fell during the election season.

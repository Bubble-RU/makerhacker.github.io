</p><p>9 Based on careful review and critique, Price and Guzmán conclude that Mejía and Uribe’s study does not resolve the question, “is violence against union members in Colombia systematic and targeted? [sent-15, score-0.974]
</p><p>10 The Mejía and Uribe study uses convenience sample data as the basis for its claims. [sent-17, score-0.152]
</p><p>11 These data are based on available, observable reports on union homicides and union activity which have been collected without a scientiﬁc random selection method. [sent-18, score-1.226]

<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat sends in an interesting explanation for the noted problems with conflict mortality studies (a topic we’ve discussed on occasion on this blog).  Spagat writes:
  
 This analysis  is based on the fact that conflict violence does not spread out at all uniformly across a map but, rather, tends to concentrate in a few areas.  This means that small, headline-grabbing violence surveys are extremely unreliable.


There is a second point, based on the work of David Hemenway which you’ve also cited on your blog.  Even within exceptionally violent environments most households will still not have a violent death.   So a very small false positive rate in a household survey will cause substantial upward bias in violence estimates.</p><p>3 0.088318646 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Stand_Your_Ground_laws_and_homicides.html">1397 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Stand Your Ground laws and homicides</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote writes:
  
Just read  this  today and my unsophisticated statistical mind is confused.


“Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics.”


From my education about statistics, I remember to be suspicious about multiple regression coefficients that are in the opposite direction of the bivariate coefficients. What I am missing? I vaguely remember something about the suppression effect.
  
My reply:
 
There’s a long literature on this from many decades ago.  My general feeling about such situations is that, when the coefficient changes a lot after controlling for other variables, it is important to visualize this change, to understand what is the interaction among variables that is associated with the change in the coefficients.  This is what we did in our Red State Blue State</p><p>5 0.077511616 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-18-Economic_Disparities_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_European_Regions.html">97 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-18-Economic Disparities and Life Satisfaction in European Regions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>3 0.75005996 <a title="145-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>4 0.74376661 <a title="145-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Causal_inference_in_economics.html">32 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Causal inference in economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.

We [Gilligan, Mvukiyehe, and Samii] use original survey data, collected in Burundi in the summer of 2007, to show that a World Bank ex-combatant reintegration program implemented after Burundi’s civil war caused significant economic reintegration for its beneficiaries but that this economic reintegration did not translate into greater political and social reintegration.


Previous studies of reintegration programs have found them to be ineffective, but these studies have suffered from selection bias: only ex-combatants who self selected into those programs were studied. We avoid such bias with a quasi-experimental research design made possible by an exogenous bureaucratic failure in the implementation of program. One of the World Bank’s implementing partners delayed implementation by almost a year due to an unforeseen contract dispute. As a result, roughly a third of ex-combatants had their program benefits withheld for reas</p><p>6 0.74044031 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the annals of hack literature, it is sometimes said that if you aim to write best-selling crap, all you’ll end up with is crap.  To truly produce best-selling crap, you have to have a conviction, perhaps misplaced, that your writing has integrity.  Whether or not this is a good generalization about writing, I have seen an analogous phenomenon in statistics:  If you try to do nothing but model the data, you can be in for a wild and unpleasant ride:  real data always seem to have one more twist beyond our ability to model (von Neumann’s elephant’s trunk notwithstanding).  But if you model the underlying process, sometimes your model can fit surprisingly well as well as inviting openings for future research progress.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89384377 <a title="145-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-13-Statistical_controversy_regarding_human_rights_violations_in_Colomnbia.html">145 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-13-Statistical controversy regarding human rights violations in Colomnbia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Megan Price wrote in that she and Daniel Guzmán of the Benetech Human Rights Program released a paper today entitled  “Comments to the article ‘Is Violence Against Union Members in Colombia Systematic and Targeted?’”  (o  aqui  en español), which examines an article written by Colombian academics Daniel Mejía and María José Uribe.  Price writes [in the third person]:
  
 
The paper reviewed by Price and Guzmán concluded that “. . . on average, violence against unionists in Colombia is neither systematic nor targeted.” However, in their response, Price and Guzmán present – in technical and methodological detail – the reasons they find the conclusions in Mejía and Uribe’s study to be overstated. Price and Guzmán believe that weaknesses in the data, in the choice of the statistical model, and the interpretation of the model used in Mejía and Uribe’s study, all raise serious questions about the authors’ strong causal conclusions.


Price and Guzmán point out that unchecked, those conclusio</p><p>3 0.89102793 <a title="145-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably_common_misunderstanding_of_meritocracy.html">1037 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably common misunderstanding of meritocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.  Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous”</p><p>4 0.88230872 <a title="145-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-28-Every_time_you_take_a_sample%2C_you%E2%80%99ll_have_to_pay_this_guy_a_quarter.html">1398 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-28-Every time you take a sample, you’ll have to pay this guy a quarter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Roy Mendelssohn pointed me to  this  heartwarming story of Jay Vadiveloo, an actuary who got a patent for the idea of statistical sampling.  Vadiveloo writes, “the results were astounding: statistical sampling worked.”
 
You may laugh, but wait till Albedo Man buys the patent and makes everybody do his bidding.  They’re gonna dig up Laplace and make him pay retroactive royalties.  And somehow Clippy will get involved in all this.
 
P.S.  Mendelssohn writes:  “Yes, I felt it was a heartwarming story also.  Perhaps we can get a patent for regression.”
 
I say, forget a patent for regression.  I want a patent for the sample mean.  That’s where the real money is.  You can’t charge a lot for each use, but consider the volume!</p><p>5 0.88030773 <a title="145-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-31-Snotty_reviewers.html">1700 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-31-Snotty reviewers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a submission a couple years ago that was rejected by a journal.  One of the reviewers began with the following snotty aside:
  
In this manuscript Gelman and Shalizi (there’s no anonymity here; this thing has been floating around the web for some time) . . .
  
Actually, we posted it on the same day we submitted it to the journal.  But double-blindness allowed the reviewer to act as if we had done something wrong!  And, even if it  had  been “floating around the web for some time,” that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Perhaps it just meant that the article had previously been rejected by a bad-attitude reviewer!</p><p>6 0.84451091 <a title="145-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-17-Modeling_group-level_predictors_in_a_multilevel_regression.html">1216 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-17-Modeling group-level predictors in a multilevel regression</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Becky Passonneau and colleagues at the Center for Computational Learning Systems (CCLS) at Columbia have been working on a project for ConEd (New York’s major electric utility) to  rank structures based on vulnerability to secondary events  (e.g., transformer explosions, cable meltdowns, electrical fires).  They’ve been using the R implementation  BayesTree  of Chipman, George and McCulloch’s  Bayesian Additive Regression Trees  (BART).
 
BART is a Bayesian non-parametric method that is non-identifiable in two ways.  Firstly, it is an additive tree model with a fixed number of trees, the indexes of which aren’t identified (you get the same predictions in a model swapping the order of the trees).  This is the same kind of non-identifiability you get with any mixture model (additive or interpolated) with an exchangeable prior on the mixture components.  Secondly, the trees themselves have varying structure over samples in terms of number of nodes and their topology (depth, branching, etc</p><p>5 0.1468109 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-The_placebo_effect_in_pharma.html">388 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-The placebo effect in pharma</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bruce McCullough writes:
  
The Sept 2009 issue of Wired had a  big article  on the increase in the placebo effect, and why it’s been getting bigger.


Kaiser Fung has a  synopsis .


As if you don’t have enough to do, I thought you might be interested in blogging on this.
  
My reply:
 
I thought Kaiser’s discussion was good, especially this point:
  
Effect on treatment group = Effect of the drug + effect of belief in being treated


Effect on placebo group = Effect of belief in being treated


Thus, the difference between the two groups = effect of the drug, since the effect of belief in being treated affects both groups of patients.
  
Thus, as Kaiser puts it, if the treatment isn’t doing better than placebo, it doesn’t say that the placebo effect is big (let alone “too big”) but that the treatment isn’t showing any additional effect.  It’s “treatment + placebo” vs. placebo, not treatment vs. placebo.
 
That said, I’d prefer for Kaiser to make it clear that the additivity he’s assu</p><p>6 0.12930524 <a title="2-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Should_Mister_P_be_allowed-encouraged_to_reside_in_counter-factual_populations%3F.html">7 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Should Mister P be allowed-encouraged to reside in counter-factual populations?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The title of this post is silly but I have an important point to make, regarding an implicit model which I think many people assume even though it does not really make sense.
 
Following a link from Sanjay Srivastava, I came across  a post  from David Funder saying that it’s useful to talk about the sizes of effects (I actually prefer the term “comparisons” so as to avoid the causal baggage) rather than just their signs.  I  agree , and I wanted to elaborate a bit on a point that comes up in Funder’s discussion.  He quotes an (unnamed) prominent social psychologist as writing:
  
The key to our research . . . [is not] to accurately estimate effect size. If I were testing an advertisement for a marketing research firm and wanted to be sure that the cost of the ad would produce enough sales to make it worthwhile, effect size would be crucial. But when I am testing a theory about whether, say, positive mood reduces information processing in comparison with negative mood, I am worried abou</p><p>5 0.74763358 <a title="2-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Should_Mister_P_be_allowed-encouraged_to_reside_in_counter-factual_populations%3F.html">7 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Should Mister P be allowed-encouraged to reside in counter-factual populations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lets say you are repeatedly going to recieve unselected sets of well done RCTs on various say medical treatments.
 
One reasonable assumption with all of these treatments is that they are monotonic – either helpful or harmful for all. The treatment effect will (as always) vary for subgroups in the population – these will not be explicitly identified in the studies – but each study very likely will enroll different percentages of the variuos patient subgroups. Being all randomized studies these subgroups will be balanced in the treatment versus control arms – but each study will (as always) be estimating a different – but exchangeable – treatment effect (Exhangeable due to the ignorance about the subgroup memberships of the enrolled patients.) 
 
That reasonable assumption – monotonicity – will be to some extent (as always) wrong, but given that it is a risk believed well worth taking – if the average effect in any population is positive (versus negative) the average effect in any other</p><p>6 0.73626423 <a title="2-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties_with_measurement-error_models_for_the_evaluation_of_wacky_claims.html">803 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties with measurement-error models for the evaluation of wacky claims</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>2 0.98788673 <a title="2-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-24-ESPN_is_looking_to_hire_a_research_analyst.html">1279 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-24-ESPN is looking to hire a research analyst</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>4 0.96834099 <a title="2-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-06-Quote_of_the_day.html">398 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-06-Quote of the day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.

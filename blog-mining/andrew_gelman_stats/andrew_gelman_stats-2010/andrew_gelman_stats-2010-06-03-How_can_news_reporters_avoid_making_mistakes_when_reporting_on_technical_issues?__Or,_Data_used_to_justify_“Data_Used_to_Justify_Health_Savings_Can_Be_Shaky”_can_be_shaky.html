[sent-3, score-0.301]
</p><p>2 This study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, raises important questions about whether being given more diagnoses is beneficial to patients and may help to explain recent controversies about regional differences in spending. [sent-4, score-0.319]
</p><p>3 Abelson and Harris’s article is interesting, thoughtful, and detailed, but along the way it reveals a serious limitation of the usual practices of journalism, when applied to evaluating scientific claims. [sent-6, score-0.121]
</p><p>4 The problem is that Abelson and Harris apply a shotgun approach, shooting all sorts of criticisms at the study without a sense of what makes sense and what doesn’t. [sent-7, score-0.066]
</p><p>5 Measures of the quality of care are not part of the formula. [sent-9, score-0.125]
</p><p>6 For all anyone knows, patients could be dying in far greater numbers in hospitals in the beige [low-spending] regions than hospitals in the brown [high-spending] ones, and Dartmouth’s maps would not pick up that difference. [sent-10, score-1.626]
</p><p>7 As any shopper knows, cheaper does not always mean better. [sent-11, score-0.101]
</p><p>8 Setting the maps aside, could it really be true that “patients could be dying in far greater numbers in hospitals in the beige regions than hospitals in the brown ones”? [sent-12, score-1.396]
</p><p>9 And, in fact, later on in the news article, the authors write that, “a 2003 study found that patients who lived in places most expensive for the Medicare program received no better care than those who lived in cheaper areas. [sent-16, score-0.689]
</p><p>10 ”   So what’s the deal with “For all anyone knows, patients could be dying in far greater numbers in hospitals in the beige regions than hospitals in the brown ones”? [sent-17, score-1.58]
</p><p>11 Abelson and Harris then write:    Even Dartmouth’s claims about which hospitals and regions are cheapest may be suspect. [sent-23, score-0.533]
</p><p>12 , may result less from how doctors work than from how patients live. [sent-27, score-0.345]
</p><p>13 Also, nurses in Houston tend to be paid more than those in North Dakota because the cost of living is higher in Houston. [sent-29, score-0.113]
</p><p>14 One of the striking things about the cost-of-care map is how  little  it corresponds with cost of living. [sent-31, score-0.071]
</p><p>15 The high-cost regions include most of Texas, just about all of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee (as well as some more expensive places such as the Bosnywash area and much of California. [sent-32, score-0.291]
</p><p>16 )  There may be a lot of problems with this study, but I can’t imagine that one of these problems is a lack of accounting for the (relatively) high cost of living in Houston. [sent-33, score-0.176]
</p><p>17 Their fundamental difficulty, I think, is the challenge of writing about a technical topic (in this case, statistics) without the relevant technical experience. [sent-37, score-0.15]
</p><p>18 )  The usual journalistic solution to reporting a technical controversy is to retreat to a he-said, she-said template, quoting experts on both sides and letting the reader decide. [sent-41, score-0.075]
</p><p>19 Abelson and Harris do this a bit, with a  quote from health economist David Cutler–but they only give Cutler one offhand sentence. [sent-45, score-0.082]
</p><p>20 I’d be curious to hear what Cutler would say about the claim that “for all anyone knows, patients could be dying in far greater numbers in hospitals in the beige regions than hospitals in the brown ones. [sent-46, score-1.621]

Brain scans may be able to predict what you will do better than you can yourself . . .  They found a way to interpret “real time” brain images to show whether people who viewed messages about using sunscreen would actually use sunscreen during the following week.


The scans were more accurate than the volunteers were, Emily Falk and colleagues at the University of California Los Angeles reported in the Journal of Neuroscience. . . .


About half the volunteers had correctly predicted whether they would use sunscreen. The research team analyzed and re-analyzed the MRI scans to see if they could find any brain activity that would do better.


Activity in one area of the brain, a particular part of the medial prefrontal cortex, provided the best information.


“From this region of the brain, we can predict for about three-quarters of the people whether they will increase their use of sunscreen beyond what they say they will do,” Lieberman said.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Michael Graham Richard has  posted some great maps  from the 1932 Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States; the maps show how long it took to get to various places in the U.S. from New York City in 1800, 1830, 1857, and 1930. (I wonder if the atlas has one from around 1900 as well, that didn’t make it into the article? I’d like to see it, too, if it exists.)  Worth a look.

<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.

<p>Introduction: Pointing to this  news article  by Megan McArdle discussing a recent study of Medicaid recipients, Jonathan Falk writes:
  
Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.
 

and

 
A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?

<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.


Specifically, the so-called P value — a mathematical measure of the strength of the evidence that there’s a true difference between a treatment and placebo — was 0.08. . . . Technically, the study was a bust, although the results leaned toward a benefit from interferon gamma-1b. Was there a group of patients in which the results tipped?

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

<p>Introduction: How am I supposed to handle this sort of thing?  (See below.)  I just stuck it one of my email folders without responding, but then I wondered . . . what’s it all about?  Is there some sort of Glengarry Glen Ross-like parallel world where down-on-their-luck Jack Lemmons of public relations world send out electronic cold calls?  More than anything else, this sort of thing makes me glad I have a steady job.
 
Here’s the (unsolicited) email, which came with the subject line “Please help a reporter do his job”:

<p>Introduction: My C-oriented Stan collaborators have convinced me to use underscore (_) rather than dot (.) as much as possible in expressions in R.  For example, I can name a variable n_years rather than n.years.  This is fine.  But I’m getting annoyed because I need to press the shift key every time I type the underscore.
 
What do people do about this?  I know that it’s easy enough to reassign keys (I could, for example, assign underscore to backslash, which I never use).  I’m just wondering what C programmers actually do.  Do they reassign the key or do they just get used to pressing Shift?
 
P.S.  In comments, Ben Hyde  points  to Google’s R style guide, which recommends that variable names use dots,  not  underscore or camel case, for variable names (for example, “avg.clicks” rather than “avg_Clicks” or “avgClicks”).  I think they’re recommending this to be consistent with  R coding conventions .
 
I am switching to underscores in R variable names to be consistent with C.

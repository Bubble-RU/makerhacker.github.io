<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:
  
Palin’s magic formula for success has been simply to ignore partisan crap and get</p><p>4 0.14676949 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-09-Rasmussen_sez%3A__%E2%80%9C108%25_of_Respondents_Say_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">135 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-09-Rasmussen sez:  “108% of Respondents Say . . .”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The recent discussion of pollsters reminded me of  a story  from a couple years ago that perhaps is still relevant . . .
 
I was looking up the governors’ popularity numbers on the web, and came across  this page from Rasmussen Reports  which shows Sarah Palin as the 3rd-most-popular governor. But then I looked more carefully. Janet Napolitano of Arizona was viewed as Excellent by 28% of respondents, Good by 27%, Fair by 26%, and Poor by 27%. That adds up to 108%! What’s going on?
 
I’d think they would have a computer program to pipe the survey results directly into the spreadsheet. But I guess not, someone must be typing in these numbers one at a time.  Another possibility is that they are altering their numbers by hand, and someone made a mistake with the Napolitano numbers, adding a few percent in one place and forgetting to subtract elsewhere.  Or maybe there’s another explanation?
  

 
P.S.  Here  are some thoughts from Mark Blumenthal

<p>Introduction: After noting the increasing political conservatism of people in the poorer states, Richard Florida  writes :
  
The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism’s hold on America’s states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal.


Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward.


But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political. This ideological state of affairs advantages the policy preferences of poorer, less innovative states over wealthier, more innovative, and productive ones. American politics is increasingly disconnected from its economic engine.  And this deepening political divide has become pe</p><p>6 0.11843171 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-25-College_football%2C_voting%2C_and_the_law_of_large_numbers.html">1547 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-25-College football, voting, and the law of large numbers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nick Obradovich saw  our graphs and regressions  showing that the most popular governors tended to come from small states and suggested looking at unemployment rates.  (I’d used change in per-capita income as my economic predictor, following the usual practice in political science.)

<p>Introduction: Jeffrey Frankel, identified as a former member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers,  writes  (link from  here ):
  
As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. . . .


The unspoken truth is that, compared to “blue-staters,” those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies.
  
An unspoken truth, huh?  Wow, that really sucks!  Something should be done about it.  Good thing that this Harvard professor and former member of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors is on the case:

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>2 0.98591882 <a title="159-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-08-Animated_drought_maps.html">1487 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-08-Animated drought maps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks sends along  this  dynamic graphic from Mike Bostock:
 
   
 
I’m not so happy with the arrangement of years by decade—the lineup of all years ending in 0, or 1, or 2, etc., seems a bit of a distraction—but in many ways the display is impressive.  And, as often is the case with such graphs, once it’s out there, other people can do similar things and make their own improvements.</p><p>3 0.98554933 <a title="159-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-24-Always_check_your_evidence.html">1025 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-24-Always check your evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Logical reasoning typically takes the following form:
 
1.  I know that A is true. 
2.  I know that A implies B. 
3.  Therefore, I can conclude that B is true.
 
I, like Lewis Carroll, have  problems  with this process sometimes, but it’s pretty standard.
 
There is also a statistical version in which the above statements are replaced by averages (“A usually happens,” etc.).
 
But in all these stories, the argument can fall down if you get the facts wrong.  Perhaps that’s one reason that statisticians can be obsessed with detail. 
   
For example, David Brooks wrote the following, in a  column  called “Living with Mistakes”:
  
The historian Leslie Hannah identified the ten largest American companies in 1912. None of those companies ranked in the top 100 companies by 1990.
  
Huh?  Could that really be?  I googled “ten largest american companies 1912″ and found  this , from Leslie Hannah:
 
  
 
No big deal:  two still in the top 10 rather than zero in the top 100, but Brooks’s general</p><p>4 0.9851411 <a title="159-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-A_graphics_talk_with_no_visuals%21.html">1598 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-A graphics talk with no visuals!</a></p>

They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

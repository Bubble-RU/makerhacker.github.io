Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points.

</p><p>4 But, as Nate points out, this ain’t actually happening:    Say that a candidate has improved her position in the polls from August to September. [sent-10, score-0.625]
</p><p>5 Sometimes, a candidate who has gained ground in the polls continues to do so; otherwise, the trend reverses itself, or the race simply flatlines. [sent-18, score-0.695]
</p><p>6 There is also no sign of momentum we look at the change in polling between other periods. [sent-22, score-0.58]
</p><p>7 In general elections, the direction in which polls have moved is not predictive of the direction in which they will move . [sent-26, score-0.548]
</p><p>8 Nate is saying that the change from A to B does not predict the change from B to C (or, to be precise, that the change from A to B is a very weak and negative predictor of the change from B to C). [sent-32, score-0.488]
</p><p>9 Public opinion is  not  a random walk    Nate does slip up at one point, when he writes:    In races with lots of polling, instead, the most robust assumption is usually that polling is essentially a random walk, i. [sent-47, score-0.826]
</p><p>10 , that the polls are about equally likely to move toward one or another candidate, regardless of which way they have moved in the past. [sent-49, score-0.518]
</p><p>11 For many races, you can use a forecast from the fundamentals to get a pretty good idea about where the polls are going to end up. [sent-51, score-0.367]
</p><p>12 Or, if you want to focus on congressional elections, take a look at the work of  Erikson, Bafumi, and Wlezien , who find predictable changes in the generic opinion polls in the year leading up to the election. [sent-54, score-0.538]
</p><p>13 First, individual polls are noisy, and so any immediate changes are likely to be noise. [sent-56, score-0.509]
</p><p>14 Second, the random walk is such a standard paradigm for statistical noise that it’s natural for Nate to use it as a default. [sent-57, score-0.434]
</p><p>15 If a team has an unexpectedly good record midway through the season, it’s likely that they will slip in the standings during the second half. [sent-65, score-0.367]

</p><p>17 )   The natural accompaniment to the random walk model is the idea that, if you can shift the polls by X percentage points at any point during the campaign, this will give you an expected X percentage point advantage when the election comes around. [sent-72, score-0.983]
</p><p>18 Another implication is that George Bush’s campaign was so awesome and Michael Dukakis’s campaign was so horrible to explain the big swing in the polls in the months leading up to the 1988 election. [sent-73, score-0.658]

<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>3 0.3797968 <a title="364-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-A_note_to_John.html">131 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-A note to John</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff the Productivity Sapper points me to  this insulting open letter to Nate Silver  written by pollster John Zogby.  I’ll go through bits of Zogby’s note line by line.  (Conflict of interest warning:  I have collaborated with Nate and I blog on his site).
  
Zogby writes:  Here is some advice from someone [Zogby] who has been where you [Silver] are today.
  
Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.
  
Zogby writes:  You [Nate] are hot right now – using an aggregate of other people’s work, you got 49 of 50 states right in 2008.
  
Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday at the  sister blog , Nate Silver forecast that the Republicans have a two-thirds chance of regaining the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, with an expected gain of 45 House seats.
 
Last month, Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien  released their forecast  that gives the Republicans an 80% chance of takeover and an expected gain of 50 seats.
 
As all the above writers emphasize, these forecasts are full of uncertainty, so I treat the two predictions–a 45-seat swing or a 50-seat swing–as essentially identical at the national level.
 
And, as regular readers know, as far back as  a year ago , the generic Congressional ballot (those questions of the form, “Which party do you plan to vote for in November?”) was also pointing to big Republican gains.
 
As Bafumi et al. point out, early generic polls are strongly predictive of the election outcome, but they need to be interpreted carefully.  The polls move in a generally predictable manner during the year leading up to an</p><p>5 0.27439547 <a title="364-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-Poll_aggregation_and_election_forecasting.html">1570 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-Poll aggregation and election forecasting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, Henry  writes  about poll averaging and election forecasts.  Henry writes that “These models need to crunch lots of polls, at the state and national level, if they’re going to provide good predictions.” Actually, you can get reasonable predictions from national-level forecasting models plus previous state-level election results, then when the election comes closer you can use national and state polls as needed. See my paper with Kari Lock,  Bayesian combination of state polls and election forecasts .  (That said, the method in that paper is fairly complicated, much more so than simply taking weighted averages of state polls, if such abundant data happen to be available.  And I’m sure our approach would need to be altered if it were used for real-time forecasts.)
 
Having a steady supply of polls of varying quality from various sources allows poll aggregators to produce  news  every day (in the sense of pushing their estimates around) but it doesn’t help much with a</p><p>6 0.26202172 <a title="364-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-03-Some_thoughts_on_election_forecasting.html">391 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-03-Some thoughts on election forecasting</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>4 0.8533408 <a title="364-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-A_note_to_John.html">131 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-A note to John</a></p>

Sorry, John.  (I can call you that, right?  Since you’re calling Nate “Nate”?).  Yes, you were once the hot pollster.  But, no, you were never where Nate is today.  Don’t kid yourself.
  
Zogby writes:  You [Nate] are hot right now – using an aggregate of other people’s work, you got 49 of 50 states right in 2008.
  
Yes, Nate used other people’s work.  That’s what’s called “making use of available data.”  Or, to use a more technical term employed in statistics, it’s called “not being an idiot.”  Only in the wacky world of polling are you supposed to draw inferences about the U.S.A. using only a single survey organization.  I do</p><p>5 0.84698033 <a title="364-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-08-Poll_aggregation_and_election_forecasting.html">1570 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-08-Poll aggregation and election forecasting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, Henry  writes  about poll averaging and election forecasts.  Henry writes that “These models need to crunch lots of polls, at the state and national level, if they’re going to provide good predictions.” Actually, you can get reasonable predictions from national-level forecasting models plus previous state-level election results, then when the election comes closer you can use national and state polls as needed. See my paper with Kari Lock,  Bayesian combination of state polls and election forecasts .  (That said, the method in that paper is fairly complicated, much more so than simply taking weighted averages of state polls, if such abundant data happen to be available.  And I’m sure our approach would need to be altered if it were used for real-time forecasts.)
 
Having a steady supply of polls of varying quality from various sources allows poll aggregators to produce  news  every day (in the sense of pushing their estimates around) but it doesn’t help much with a</p><p>6 0.83961046 <a title="364-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-27-A_Non-random_Walk_Down_Campaign_Street.html">1512 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-27-A Non-random Walk Down Campaign Street</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As I  wrote  a couple years ago:
  
Even though statistical analysis has demonstrated that presidential elections are predictable given economic conditions and previous votes in the states . . . it certainly doesn’t mean that every election can be accurately predicted ahead of time.  Presidential general election campaigns have several distinct features that distinguish them from most other elections:


1.  Two major candidates; 
2.  The candidates clearly differ in their political ideologies and in their positions on economic issues; 
3.  The two sides have roughly equal financial and organizational resources; 
4.  The current election is the latest in a long series of similar contests (every four years); 
5.  A long campaign, giving candidates a long time to present their case and giving voters a long time to make up their minds.


Other elections look different. . . .
  
Or, as I  said  in reference to the current NYC mayoral election:

<p>Introduction: The National Climatic Data Center has  tentatively announced  that 2010 is, get this, “tied” for warmest on record.  Presumably they mean it’s tied to the precision that they quote (1.12 F above the 20th-century average). The uncertainty in the measurements, as well as some fuzziness about exactly what is being measured (how much of the atmosphere, and the oceans) makes these global-average things really suspect.  For instance, if there’s more oceanic turnover one year, that can warm the deep ocean but cool the shallow ocean and atmosphere, so even though the heat content of the atmosphere-ocean system goes up, some of these “global-average” estimates can go down. The reverse can happen too.  And of course there are various sources of natural variability that are not, these days, what most people are most interested in.  So everybody who knows about the climate professes to hate the emphasis on climate records.  And yet, they’re irresistible.  I’m sure we’ll see the usual clamor of som</p><p>4 0.96509051 <a title="364-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-07-Hangman_tips.html">1250 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-07-Hangman tips</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

<p>Introduction: John Tukey wrote about semigraphic displays.  I think his most famous effort in that area–the stem-and-leaf plot–is just horrible.  But the general idea of viewing tables as graphs is good, and it’s been a success at least since the early 1900s, when Ramanujan famously intuited the behavior of the partition number by seeing a table of numbers and implicitly reading it as a graph on the logarithmic scale.
 
To return to the present, Steve Roth sent me a link to these table/graphs that he made:
  

 
 Europe vs. US: Who’s Winning?  and  State Taxes and Prosperity, Revisited .  He writes:
  
I [Roth] find the layout with the red/black gives a simultaneous numeric and graphical representation of the situation, and condenses a lot of immediately apprehensible info into a small space. 


It also helps me avoid at least one axis of cherry-picking (periods), which I am as prone to as all humans are.

<p>Introduction: I was at a talk awhile ago where the speaker presented tables with 4, 5, 6, even 8 significant digits even though, as is usual, only the first or second digit of each number conveyed any useful information.  A graph would be better, but even if you’re too lazy to make a plot, a bit of rounding would seem to be required.
 
I mentioned this to a colleague, who responded:
  
I don’t know how to stop this practice.  Logic doesn’t work.  Maybe ridicule?  Best hope is the departure from field who do it.  (Theories don’t die, but the people who follow those theories retire.)
  
Another possibility, I think, is helpful software defaults.  If we can get to the people who write the software, maybe we could have some impact.
 
Once the software is written, however, it’s probably too late.  I’m not far from the center of the R universe, but I don’t know if I’ll ever succeed in my goals of increasing the default number of histogram bars or reducing the default number of decimal places in regression</p><p>4 0.15106978 <a title="372-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.

Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.

<p>Introduction: I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I’d share an old story.
 
About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>2 0.93818307 <a title="372-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.


Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users can learn and p</p><p>3 0.90412223 <a title="372-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">1119 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association is seeking nominations for its annual  Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award .  The award was created in 2004 to encourage and recognize members of the communications media who have best displayed an informed interest in the science of statistics and its role in public life. The award can be given for a single statistical article or for a body of work.
 
Former winners of the award include:  Felix Salmon , financial blogger, 2010;  Sharon Begley , Newsweek, 2009; Mark Buchanan, New York Times, 2008; John Berry, Bloomberg News, 2005; and Gina Kolata, New York Times, 2004.
 
If anyone has any suggestions for the 2012 award, feel free to post in the comments or email me.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89181507 <a title="372-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-27-A_use_for_tables_%28really%29.html">372 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-27-A use for tables (really)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>5 0.8882789 <a title="372-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Proposal_for_a_moratorium_on_the_use_of_the_words_%E2%80%9Cfashionable%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Ctrendy%E2%80%9D.html">189 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Proposal for a moratorium on the use of the words “fashionable” and “trendy”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>6 0.86452687 <a title="372-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-26-Bad_news_about_%28some%29_statisticians.html">1282 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-26-Bad news about (some) statisticians</a></p>

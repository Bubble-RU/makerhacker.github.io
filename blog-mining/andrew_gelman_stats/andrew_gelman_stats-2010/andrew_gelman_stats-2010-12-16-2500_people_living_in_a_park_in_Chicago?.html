 Here  is the google satellite view.


 Here  is the nytimes page.  Go to Chicago, and zoom over to the census tract 2521, which is just north of the horizontal gray line (Eisenhower Expressway, aka I290) and just east of Oak Park. The park is labeled on the nytimes map.


The census data have around 50 dots (they say 50 people per dot) in the park which has no residential buildings.


Congressional district is Danny Davis, IL7.   Here’s  a map of the district.


So, how do we explain the map showing ~50 dots worth of people living in the park. What’s up with the algorithm to place the dots?

<p>Introduction: Andrew Vande Moere points to  this  impressive interactive map from Brandon Martin-Anderson showing the locations of all the residents of the United States and Canada.
 
It says, “The map has 341,817,095 dots – one for each person.”  Not quite . . . I was hoping to zoom into my building (approximately 10 people live on our floor, I say approximately because two of the apartments are split between two floors and I’m not sure how they would assign the residents), but unfortunately our entire block is just a solid mass of black.  Also, they put a few dots in the park and in the river by accident (presumably because the borders of the census blocks were specified only approximately).  But, hey, no algorithm is perfect.
 
 
 
It’s hard to know what to do about this.  The idea of mapping every person is cool, but you’ll always run into trouble displaying densely populated areas.

<p>Introduction: This one  was so beautiful I just had to repost it:
 
From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.  But what’s amazing i</p><p>4 0.63871318 <a title="469-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-24-Trends_in_partisanship_by_state.html">536 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-24-Trends in partisanship by state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

Columbus Park is on Chicago’s west side, in the Austin neighborhood. The park is a big green area which includes a golf course.


 Here  is the google satellite view.


 Here  is the nytimes page.  Go to Chicago, and zoom over to the census tract 2521, which is just north of the horizontal gray line (Eisenhower Expressway, aka I290) and just east of Oak Park. The park is labeled on the nytimes map.


The census data have around 50 dots (they say 50 people per dot) in the park which has no residential buildings.


Congressional district is Danny Davis, IL7.   Here’s  a map of the district.


So, how do we explain the map showing ~50 dots worth of people living in the park. What’s up with the algorithm to place the dots?
  
I dunno.  I leave this one to you, the readers.</p><p>2 0.85474741 <a title="469-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-17-Rust.html">1538 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-17-Rust</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aki writes:
  
Here’s my version of the  birthday frequency graph . I used Gaussian process with two slowly varying components and periodic component with decay, so that periodic form can change in time. I used Student’s t-distribution as observation model to allow exceptional dates to be outliers. I guess that periodic component due to week effect is still in the data because there is data only from twenty years. Naturally it would be better to model the whole timeseries, but it was easier to just use the cvs by Mulligan.
  
   
 
ALl I can say is . . . wow.  Bayes wins again.  Maybe Aki can supply the R or Matlab code?
 
P.S.  And let’s not forget how great the simple and clear time series plots are, compared to various fancy visualizations that people might try.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  article  by Jonah Berger and Gael Le Mens:
  
Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-r</p><p>5 0.80576557 <a title="469-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-29-Jost_Haidt.html">1515 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-29-Jost Haidt</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Research psychologist John Jost  reviews  the recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” by research psychologist Jonathan Haidt.  Some of my thoughts on Haidt’s book are  here .  And here’s some of Jost’s review:
  
Haidt’s book is creative, interesting, and provocative. . . . The book shines a new light on moral psychology and presents a bold, confrontational message. From a scientific perspective, however, I worry that his theory raises more questions than it answers. Why do some individuals feel that it is morally good (or necessary) to obey authority, favor the ingroup, and maintain purity, whereas others are skeptical? (Perhaps parenting style is relevant after all.) Why do some people think that it is morally acceptable to judge or even mistreat others such as gay or lesbian couples or, only a generation ago, interracial couples because they dislike or feel disgusted by them, whereas others do not? Why does the present generation “care about violence toward many more classes of victims</p><p>6 0.78644526 <a title="469-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-DBQQ_rounding_for_labeling_charts_and_communicating_tolerances.html">939 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-DBQQ rounding for labeling charts and communicating tolerances</a></p>

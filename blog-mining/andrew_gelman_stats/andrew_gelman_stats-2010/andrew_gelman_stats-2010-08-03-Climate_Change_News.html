But what is the effect of rain, snow, fog, heat and wind on work that occurs indoors, such as the production of automobiles?

<p>Introduction: A  recent article  on global warming reminded me of the difficulty of letting the data speak.  William Nordhaus shows the following graph: 
   
   
 
And then he writes:
  
One of the reasons that drawing conclusions on temperature trends is tricky is that the historical temperature series is highly volatile, as can be seen in the figure. The presence of short-term volatility requires looking at long-term trends. A useful analogy is the stock market. Suppose an analyst says that because real stock prices have declined over the last decade (which is true), it follows that there is no upward trend. Here again, an examination of the long-term data would quickly show this to be incorrect. The last decade of temperature and stock market data is not representative of the longer-term trends.


The finding that global temperatures are rising over the last century-plus is one of the most robust findings of climate science and statistics.

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: I hate to keep bumping our scheduled posts but this is just too important and too exciting to wait.  So it’s time to jump the queue.
 
 
 
The news is  a paper from Michael Betancourt  that presents a super-cool new way to compute normalizing constants:
  
A common strategy for inference in complex models is the relaxation of a simple model into the more complex target model, for example the prior into the posterior in Bayesian inference. Existing approaches that attempt to generate such transformations, however, are sensitive to the pathologies of complex distributions and can be difficult to implement in practice. Leveraging the geometry of thermodynamic processes I introduce a principled and robust approach to deforming measures that presents a powerful new tool for inference.
  
The idea is to generalize Hamiltonian Monte Carlo so that it moves through a family of distributions (that is, it transitions through an “inverse temperature” variable called beta that indexes the family) a</p><p>6 0.20550001 <a title="180-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-31-Skepticism_about_skepticism_of_global_warming_skepticism_skepticism.html">983 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-31-Skepticism about skepticism of global warming skepticism skepticism</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang shares some bad news:
 
   
 
   
  
Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.


Chris Sheehan just sent me  this NYT article on air conditioning , where they mention this neat natural experiment:

 
[I]n the past year, [Japan] became an unwitting laboratory to study even more extreme air-conditioning abstinence, and the results have not been encouraging.

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).  Each of the plots overlays data from several databases (not necessarily indepenedent of each other), and you can select which ones to include or leave</p><p>2 0.99682951 <a title="180-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-29-Clueless_Americans_think_they%E2%80%99ll_never_get_sick.html">1288 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-29-Clueless Americans think they’ll never get sick</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  points  to a  report  from a corporate survey:
  
Sixty-two percent of U.S. employees say it’s not likely they or a family member will be diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer, a survey indicates.


The Aflac WorkForces Report, a survey of nearly 1,900 benefits decision-makers and more than 6,100 U.S. workers, also indicated 55 percent said they were not very or not at all likely to be diagnosed with a chronic illness, such as heart disease or diabetes.
  
Here are some actual statistics:
  
The American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2012, said 1-in-3 women and 1-in-2 men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, and the National Safety Council, Injury Facts 2011 edition, says more than 38.9 million injuries occur in a year requiring medical treatment.


The American Heart Association, Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics 2012, said 1-in-6 U.S. deaths were caused by coronary heart disease, Tillman said.

<p>Introduction: Joan Garfield, a leading researcher in statistics education, is conducting a survey of graduate students who teach or assist with the teaching of statistics.  She writes: 
  
  
We want to invite them to take a short survey that will enable us to collect some baseline data that we may use in a grant proposal we are developing.  The project would provide summer workshops and ongoing support for graduate students who will be teaching or assisting with teaching introductory statistics classes. If the grant is funded, we would invite up to 40 students from around the country who are entering graduate programs in statistics to participate in a three-year training and support program.  The goal of this program is to help these students become expert and flexible teachers of statistics, and to support them as they move through their teaching experiences as graduate students.
  
Here’s the  the online survey .  Garfield writes, “Your responses are completely voluntary and anonymous.

<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.

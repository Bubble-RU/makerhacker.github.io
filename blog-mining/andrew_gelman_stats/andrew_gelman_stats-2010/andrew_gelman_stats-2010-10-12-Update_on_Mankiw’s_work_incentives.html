Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.

</p><p>5 Neither Cowen nor Mankiw address the problem that Mankiw estimates his current marginal tax rate at 80%, whereas only two years ago he estimated his marginal tax rate under a hypothetical Obama administration at 93%. [sent-11, score-1.247]
</p><p>6 One might argue that, whether the marginal tax rate is 93%, 90%, 80%, or even 70%, it’s still a lot–it’s a drag on the economy and a disincentive for productive people to work. [sent-15, score-0.772]
</p><p>7 This might be true, but that gets back to my original point from two years ago, that Mankiw is still working  despite  these tax rates. [sent-16, score-0.359]
</p><p>8 In fact, before his recent column came out, I was thinking that Mankiw was working despite what he judged as a 93% marginal tax rate. [sent-17, score-0.733]
</p><p>9 I agree that, ability to pay aside, there’s something demoralizing about knowing that a large fraction of your marginal income goes to the government, much of it for programs that you don’t approve of. [sent-19, score-0.311]
</p><p>10 In Mankiw’s case, though, there is a solution:  he could use his marginal income (which, as he said, he doesn’t need right now) to hire some research assistants. [sent-21, score-0.311]
</p><p>11 I don’t know the details of the tax law, but I’m sure his marginal rate would be much much less than 93% or 80% or the other numbers he’s talking about. [sent-22, score-0.6]
</p><p>12 The discussion of Mankiw’s column seems to have caused him to rethink one of his ideas. [sent-24, score-0.183]

</p><p>14 At the time, I  suggested  that perhaps Mankiw is working not for the money but for the fun and also out of some sense of moral obligation (for example, to do his part to stop a proposed government policy that he opposes). [sent-34, score-0.401]
</p><p>15 For whatever reason, Mankiw has added some of these motivations into his calculus and now writes:    I [Mankiw] face a choice among a wide range of activities, each of which offers some combination of pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits. [sent-35, score-0.297]
</p><p>16 When the government taxes pecuniary benefits, I spend more time on those activities that yield non-pecuniary benefits. [sent-39, score-0.491]
</p><p>17 But he still needs to recognize that he does some things for motivations that are neither familial (saving money for his kids), pecuniary, or for fun. [sent-42, score-0.34]
</p><p>18 I’m not saying he needs to be taxed at 93% on these efforts, though; he could perhaps set up a special cookie jar for his extra income and spend it in a productive way on his research so it won’t get swallowed up by inheritance taxes in 30 years. [sent-44, score-0.682]
</p><p>19 This could have the effect of furthering his advocacy and policy goals and give him the sense that his extra money is going somewhere useful. [sent-46, score-0.347]
</p><p>20 Cowen argues that details-oriented commenters like me are missing the point:  the issue is not Mankiw’s particular circumstances but rather the larger issues of the efficiency and morality of high tax rates. [sent-49, score-0.255]

<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.  At the time, I conjectured this was a general difference in attitude between political scientists and economists, but in retrospect I realize I’m dealing with n=1 in each case.
 
 See here  for further discussion of taxing “justly acquired endowments.”
 
The only reason I’m bringing this all up now is that I think it is relevant to our recent discussion  here  and  here  of Mankiw’s work incentives.  Mankiw objected to paying a higher marginal tax rate, and I think part of this is that he sees taxes as a form of punishment, and since he came by his income honestly he doesn’t think it’s fair to have to pay taxes on it.   My perspective i</p><p>5 0.39792293 <a title="338-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.18615705 <a title="338-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-Economists_don%E2%80%99t_think_like_accountants%E2%80%94but_maybe_they_should.html">922 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-Economists don’t think like accountants—but maybe they should</a></p>

Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.

Without any taxes, accepting that editor’s assignment would have yielded my children an extra $10,000. With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family’s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?


By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000. I would have twice the incentive to keep working.
 

 First, the good news 


Obama’s tax rates are much lower than Mankiw had anticipated!  According to the above quote, his marginal tax rate is currently 80% but threatens to rise to 90%.


But, in October 2008, Mankiw  calculated  that Obama’s</p><p>4 0.9512217 <a title="338-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw_tax_update.html">366 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-24-Mankiw tax update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was going through the blog and noticed  this note  on an article by Mankiw and Weinzierl who implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.”  This didn’t make much sense to me–whether it’s the sales tax, the income tax, or whatever, I see taxes as a way to raise money, not as a form of punishment.  At the time, I conjectured this was a general difference in attitude between political scientists and economists, but in retrospect I realize I’m dealing with n=1 in each case.
 
 See here  for further discussion of taxing “justly acquired endowments.”
 
The only reason I’m bringing this all up now is that I think it is relevant to our recent discussion  here  and  here  of Mankiw’s work incentives.  Mankiw objected to paying a higher marginal tax rate, and I think part of this is that he sees taxes as a form of punishment, and since he came by his income honestly he doesn’t think it’s fair to have to pay taxes on it.   My perspective i</p><p>5 0.87226439 <a title="338-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.78302068 <a title="338-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-30-A_tax_on_inequality%2C_or_a_tax_to_keep_inequality_at_the_current_level%3F.html">1145 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-30-A tax on inequality, or a tax to keep inequality at the current level?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to a  blog  by Greg Mankiw with further details on his argument that his anticipated 90% marginal tax rate will reduce his work level.
 
Having already given  my thoughts  on Mankiw’s column, I merely have a few things to add/emphasize.
  

 
1.  Cowen frames the arguments in terms of the “status” of George Bush, Greg Mankiw, Barack Obama, and their proposed policies.  I hadn’t thought of the arguments as being about status, but I think I see what Cowen is saying.  By being a well-known economist and having a column in the New York Times, Mankiw is trading some of his status for political advocacy (just as Krugman does, from the opposite direction).  If Mankiw didn’t have the pre-existing status, I doubt this particular column would’ve made it into the newspaper.  (Again, ditto with many of Krugman’s columns.)  So it makes sense that arguments about the substance of Mankiw’s remarks will get tied into disputes about his status.

Neither Cowen nor Mankiw address</p><p>3 0.9558785 <a title="338-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Mankiw%E2%80%99s_marginal_tax_rate_%28which_declined_from_93%25_to_80%25_in_two_years%29_and_the_difficulty_of_microeconomic_reasoning.html">336 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Mankiw’s marginal tax rate (which declined from 93% to 80% in two years) and the difficulty of microeconomic reasoning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wegman:  “It’s not reprinted 100 percent like you had it.”
 
Wikipedia guy:  “No, you added another paragraph at the end and you changed the headline. . . . You even copied the typos that I’ve corrected on my website.  It was taken verbatim and reprinted in your paper.”
 
The original author got a  check  for $500 but, unfortunately, no free subscription to “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics” (a $1400-$2800  value ).
 
P.S.  To those who think I’m being mean to Wegman:  I haven’t yet heard that he’s apologized to the people whose work he copied without attribution, or to the people who spent their time tracking all this down, or to the U.S. Congress for misrepresenting his expertise in his official report.
 
Everyone makes mistakes, and just about everyone has ethical lapses at times.

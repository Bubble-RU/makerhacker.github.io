<p>Introduction: I met Seth back in the early 1990s when we were both professors at the University of California.  He sometimes came to the statistics department seminar and we got to talking about various things; in particular we shared an interest in statistical graphics.  Much of my work in this direction eventually went toward the use of graphical displays to understand fitted models.  Seth went in another direction and got interested in the role of exploratory data analysis in science, the idea that we could use graphs not just to test or even understand a model but also as the source of new hypotheses.  We continued to discuss these issues over the years;  see here , for example.
 
At some point when we were at Berkeley the administration was encouraging the faculty to teach freshman seminars, and I had the idea of teaching a course on left-handedness.  I’d just read the book by Stanley Coren and thought it would be fun to go through it with a class, chapter by chapter.  But my knowledge of psych</p><p>3 0.28069302 <a title="446-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-02-Selection_bias%2C_or%2C_How_you_can_think_the_experts_don%E2%80%99t_check_their_models%2C_if_you_simply_don%E2%80%99t_look_at_what_the_experts_actually_are_doing.html">1295 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-02-Selection bias, or, How you can think the experts don’t check their models, if you simply don’t look at what the experts actually are doing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: Seth, a retired university professor who, during his employment at an elite school, spent a lot of time doing research with the goal of improving people’s lives,  writes :
  
Professors, especially at elite schools, dislike doing research with obvious value. It strikes them as menial. “Practical” and “applied” are terms of disparagement, whereas “pure” research (research without obvious value) is good.
  
Given that Seth isn’t that way himself, I assume he’d say that this claim applies to “many” professors or “most” professors but surely not all?
 
What I’ve noticed, though, is more the opposite, that even people who do extremely theoretical work like to feel that it is applied, practical, and useful.  I think that, among other things, Seth is confusing what people  want to do  with what they actually  can do .  For example, he criticizes biologists for researching stem cells and prions rather than prevention of disease.  But preventing diseases is difficult!  That’s why the scientists</p><p>5 0.16026685 <a title="446-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-16-Priors.html">1941 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-16-Priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Firoozye writes:
  
While I am absolutely sympathetic to the Bayesian agenda I am often troubled by the requirement of having priors. We must have priors on the parameter of an infinite number of model we have never seen before and I find this troubling. There is a similarly troubling problem in economics of utility theory. Utility is on consumables. To be complete a consumer must assign utility to all sorts of things they never would have encountered. More recent versions of utility theory instead make consumption goods a portfolio of attributes. Cadillacs are x many units of luxury y of transport etc etc. And we can automatically have personal utilities to all these attributes.  


I don’t ever see parameters. Some model have few and some have hundreds. Instead, I see data. So I don’t know how to have an opinion on parameters themselves. Rather I think it far more natural to have opinions on the behavior of models. The prior predictive density is a good and sensible notion.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reacted  (see further discussion in comments  here ) to a recent study on early childhood intervention, in which researchers Paul Gertler, James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Arianna Zanolini, Christel Vermeerch, Susan Walker, Susan M. Chang, and Sally Grantham-McGregor estimated that a particular intervention on young children had raised incomes on young adults by 42%.  I wrote:
  
Major decisions on education policy can turn on the statistical interpretation of small, idiosyncratic data sets — in this case, a study of 129 Jamaican children. . . . Overall, I have no reason to doubt the direction of the effect, namely, that psychosocial stimulation should be good. But I’m skeptical of the claim that income differed by 42%, due to the reason of  the statistical significance filter .

Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

Brain scans may be able to predict what you will do better than you can yourself . . .  They found a way to interpret “real time” brain images to show whether people who viewed messages about using sunscreen would actually use sunscreen during the following week.


The scans were more accurate than the volunteers were, Emily Falk and colleagues at the University of California Los Angeles reported in the Journal of Neuroscience. . . .


About half the volunteers had correctly predicted whether they would use sunscreen. The research team analyzed and re-analyzed the MRI scans to see if they could find any brain activity that would do better.


Activity in one area of the brain, a particular part of the medial prefrontal cortex, provided the best information.


“From this region of the brain, we can predict for about three-quarters of the people whether they will increase their use of sunscreen beyond what they say they will do,” Lieberman said.

I was quite happy that recently you shared some thoughts of yours and others on meta-analysis. I especially liked the  slides by Chris Schmid  that you linked from your blog. A large portion of my work deals with meta-analysis and I am also fond of using Bayesian methods (actually two of the projects I am working on are very Bayesian), though I can not say I have opinions with respect to the underlying philosophy. I would say though, that I do share your view that there are good reasons to use informative priors.


The reason I am writing to you is that this leads to the following dilemma, which is puzzling me. Say a number of scientists conduct similar studies over the years and all of them did this in a Bayesian fashion. If each of the groups used informative priors based on the research of existing groups the priors could become more and more informative over the years, since more and more is known over the subject.

I’m working on a project that uses a binary choice model on panel data. Since I have panel data and am using MLE, I’m concerned about heteroskedasticity making my estimates inconsistent and biased. 


Are you familiar with any statistical packages with pre-built tests for heteroskedasticity in binary choice ML models? If not, is there value in cutting my data into groups over which I guess the error variance might vary and eyeballing residual plots? Have you other suggestions about how I might resolve this concern?
  
I replied that I wouldn’t worry so much about heteroskedasticity.  Breaking up the data into pieces might make sense, but for the purpose of estimating how the coefficients might vary—that is, nonlinearity and interactions.
 
Soren shot back:
  
I’m somewhat puzzled however: homoskedasticity is an identifying assumption in estimating a probit model: if we don’t have it all sorts of bad things can happen to our parameter estimates.

Consider the Seeds example in vol. 1 of the BUGS examples.  There, a binomial likelihood has a p parameter constructed, via logit, from two covariates.  What I am wondering is: Would it be legitimate, in a binomial + logit problem like this, to allow binomial p[i] to be a function of the corresponding n[i] or would that amount to using the data in the prior?  In other words, in the context of the Seeds example, is r[] the only data or is n[] data as well and therefore not permissible in a prior formulation?


I [McLaughlin] currently have a model with a common beta prior for all p[i] but would like to mitigate this commonality (a kind of James-Stein effect) when there are lots of observations for some i.  But this seems to feed the data back into the prior.  Does it really?


It also occurs to me [McLaughlin] that, perhaps, a binomial likelihood is not the one to use here (not flexible enough).

The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)

I will restrict my discussion to social science examples. Social scientists are often tempted to illustrate their ideas with examples from medical research. When it comes to medicine, though, we are, with rare exceptions, at best ignorant laypersons (in my case, not even reaching that level), and it is my impression that by reaching for medical analogies we are implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes.

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

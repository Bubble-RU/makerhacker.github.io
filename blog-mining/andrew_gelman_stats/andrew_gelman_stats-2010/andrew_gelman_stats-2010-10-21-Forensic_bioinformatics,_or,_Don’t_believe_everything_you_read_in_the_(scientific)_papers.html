<p>Introduction: In light of the recent  article  about drug-target research and replication (Andrew blogged it  here ) and  l’affaire   Potti , I have mentioned the  “Forensic Bioinformatics” paper  (Baggerly & Coombes 2009) to several colleagues in passing this week. I have concluded that it has not gotten the attention it deserves, though it has been  discussed  on this blog before too.

The authors try to reproduce published data, and end up “reverse engineering” what the original authors had to have done. Some examples:
  
 §2.2: “Training data sensitive/resistant labels are reversed.” 
 §2.4: “Only 84/122 test samples are distinct; some samples are labeled both sensitive and resistant.” 
 §2.7: Almost half of the data is incorrectly labeled resistant. 
 §3.2: “This offset involves a single row shift: for example, … [data from] row 98 were used instead of those from row 97.”

<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil
 
A  recent post on this blog  discusses a prominent case of an Excel error leading to substantially wrong results from a statistical analysis. Excel is notorious for this because it is easy to add a row or column of data (or intermediate results) but forget to update equations so that they correctly use the new data. That particular error is less common in a language like R because R programmers usually refer to data by variable name (or by applying functions to a named variable), so the same code works even if you add or remove data.
 
Still, there is plenty of opportunity for errors no matter what language one uses. Andrew  ran into problems  fairly recently, and also blogged about  another instance.  I’ve never had to retract a paper, but that’s partly because I haven’t published a whole lot of papers. Certainly I have found plenty of substantial errors pretty late in some of my data analyses, and I obviously don’t have sufficient mechanisms in place to be sure</p><p>5 0.08664079 <a title="360-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-19-%E2%80%9CBehind_a_cancer-treatment_firm%E2%80%99s_rosy_survival_claims%E2%80%9D.html">1906 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-19-“Behind a cancer-treatment firm’s rosy survival claims”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally. And 64 percent of its prostate cancer patients are alive at three years, vers</p><p>6 0.078836337 <a title="360-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-26-Difficulties_in_making_inferences_about_scientific_truth_from_distributions_of_published_p-values.html">2040 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-26-Difficulties in making inferences about scientific truth from distributions of published p-values</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  blogged  on John Gottman, a psychologist whose headline-grabbing research on marriages (he got himself featured in Blink with a claim that he could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced—after meeting with them for 15 minutes!) was recently debunked in a book by Laurie Abraham.
 
The question I raised was:  how could someone who was evidently so intelligent and accomplished—Gottman, that is—get things so wrong?  My brief conclusion was that once you have some success, I guess there’s not much of a motivation to change your ways.  Also, I could well believe that, for all its flaws, Gottman’s work is better than much of the other research out there on marriages.  There’s still the question of how this stuff gets published in scientific journals. I haven’t looked at Gottman’s articles in detail and so don’t really have thoughts on that one.
 
Anyway, I recently corresponded with a mathematician who had heard of Gottman’s research and wrote</p><p>3 0.73090923 <a title="360-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-02-Moving_beyond_hopeless_graphics.html">1403 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-02-Moving beyond hopeless graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was at a talk awhile ago where the speaker presented tables with 4, 5, 6, even 8 significant digits even though, as is usual, only the first or second digit of each number conveyed any useful information.  A graph would be better, but even if you’re too lazy to make a plot, a bit of rounding would seem to be required.
 
I mentioned this to a colleague, who responded:
  
I don’t know how to stop this practice.  Logic doesn’t work.  Maybe ridicule?  Best hope is the departure from field who do it.  (Theories don’t die, but the people who follow those theories retire.)
  
Another possibility, I think, is helpful software defaults.  If we can get to the people who write the software, maybe we could have some impact.
 
Once the software is written, however, it’s probably too late.  I’m not far from the center of the R universe, but I don’t know if I’ll ever succeed in my goals of increasing the default number of histogram bars or reducing the default number of decimal places in regression</p><p>4 0.72900337 <a title="360-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-04-Interrogating_p-values.html">1883 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-04-Interrogating p-values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article  is a discussion of a  paper  by Greg Francis for a special issue, edited by E. J. Wagenmakers, of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology.  Here’s what I wrote:
  
Much of statistical practice is an effort to reduce or deny variation and uncertainty. The reduction is done through standardization, replication, and other practices of experimental design, with the idea being to isolate and stabilize the quantity being estimated and then average over many cases. Even so, however, uncertainty persists, and statistical hypothesis testing is in many ways an endeavor to deny this, by reporting binary accept/reject decisions.


Classical statistical methods produce binary statements, but there is no reason to assume that the world works that way. Expressions such as Type 1 error, Type 2 error, false positive, and so on, are based on a model in which the world is divided into real and non-real effects. To put it another way, I understand the general scientific distinction of real vs</p><p>5 0.72734153 <a title="360-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-Write_This_Book.html">1605 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-Write This Book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

<p>Introduction: Stephen Ansolabehere, Marc Meredith, and Erik Snowberg  write :
  
The literature on economic voting notes that voters’ subjective evaluations of the overall state of the economy are correlated with vote choice, whereas personal economic experiences are not. Missing from this literature is a description of how voters acquire information about the general state of the economy, and how that information is used to form perceptions. In order to begin understanding this process, we [Ansolabehere, Meredith, and Snowberg] asked a series of questions on the 2006 ANES Pilot about respondents’ perceptions of the average price of gas and the unemployment rate in their home state.


We find that questions about gas prices and unemployment show differences in the sources of information about these two economic variables. Information about unemployment rates come from media sources, and are systematically biased by partisan factors. Information about gas prices, in contrast, comes only from everyday</p><p>2 0.95616496 <a title="360-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-23-Philosophy%3A__Pointer_to_Salmon.html">1181 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-23-Philosophy:  Pointer to Salmon</a></p>

I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.

<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.  But usually I don’t drift too far from reality because I have a lot of cross-checks and I (or my</p><p>6 0.90038276 <a title="360-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Term_Limits_for_the_Supreme_Court%3F.html">235 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Term Limits for the Supreme Court?</a></p>

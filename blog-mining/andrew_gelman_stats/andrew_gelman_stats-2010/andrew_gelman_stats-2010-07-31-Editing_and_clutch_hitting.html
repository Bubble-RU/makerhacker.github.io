<p>Introduction: Following up on our  discussion  of professionalism (in which Jonathan Chait argued that “the definition of a professional career track” requires pay differentials and the chance to get fired, and I argued the opposite, that a lot of people go into professional careers specifically because of the job security), Austin Frakt pointed me to  this description  of professionalism from Go master Toshiro Kageyama.
 
This in turn reminds me of a remark of Bill James when he explained lack of surprise that clutch hitting does not show up in the data.  He wrote that the underlying idea of clutch hitting is that a player will play particuarly well in an important situation where the game or the season is on the line.  But, James pointed out, these guys are pros, and the true sign of a professional is that he can always stay concentrated.
 
This argument applies particuarly for hitting, maybe less so for pitching, where a pitcher can’t necessarily throw his hardest for 100 pitches in a game.</p><p>3 0.16584396 <a title="173-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-27-Why_can%E2%80%99t_I_be_more_like_Bill_James%2C_or%2C_The_use_of_default_and_default-like_models.html">541 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-27-Why can’t I be more like Bill James, or, The use of default and default-like models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: During our discussion of estimates of teacher performance, Steve Sailer  wrote :
  
I suspect we’re going to take years to work the kinks out of overall rating systems.


By way of analogy, Bill James kicked off the modern era of baseball statistics analysis around 1975. But he stuck to doing smaller scale analyses and avoided trying to build one giant overall model for rating players. In contrast, other analysts such as Pete Palmer rushed into building overall ranking systems, such as his 1984 book, but they tended to generate curious results such as the greatness of Roy Smalley Jr.. James held off until 1999 before unveiling his win share model for overall rankings.
  
I remember looking at Pete Palmer’s book many years ago and being disappointed that he did everything through his Linear Weights formula. A hit is worth X, a walk is worth Y, etc.  Some of this is good–it’s presumably an improvement on counting walks as 0 or 1 hits, also an improvement on counting doubles and triples a</p><p>4 0.13801382 <a title="173-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-05-A_statistician_rereads_Bill_James.html">697 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-05-A statistician rereads Bill James</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.  Then I sent him some reflections on the great Bill James and  he published it !  If anybody out there knows Bill James, please send this on to him:  I have some questions at the end that I’m curious about.
 
Here’s how it begins:
  
 
I read my first Bill James book in 1984, took my first statistics class in 1985, and began graduate study in statistics the next year. Besides giving me the opportunity to study with the best applied statistician of the late 20th century (Don Rubin) and the best theoretical statistician of the early 21st (Xiao-Li Meng), going to graduate school at Harvard in 1986 gave me the opportunity to sit in a basement room one evening that</p><p>5 0.13665053 <a title="173-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-17-%E2%80%9CFaith_means_belief_in_something_concerning_which_doubt_is_theoretically_possible.%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%94_William_James.html">1419 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-17-“Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.” — William James</a></p>

I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.

<p>Introduction: I was recently rereading and enjoying Bill James’s Historical Baseball Abstract (the second edition, from 2001).
 
But even the Master is not perfect.  Here he is, in the context of the all-time 20th-greatest shortstop (in his reckoning):
  
Are athletes special people?  In general, no, but occasionally, yes.  Johnny Pesky at 75 was trim, youthful, optimistic, and practically exploding with energy.  You rarely meet anybody like that who  isn’t  an ex-athlete–and that makes athletes seem special. [italics in the original]
  
Hey, I’ve met 75-year-olds like that–and none of them are ex-athletes!  That’s probably because I don’t know a lot of ex-athletes.  But Bill James . . . he knows a lot of athletes.  He went to the bathroom with Tim Raines once!  The most I can say is that I saw Rickey Henderson steal a couple bases when he was playing against the Orioles once.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)


This does not appear to work since it wi</p><p>same-blog 5 0.9066205 <a title="173-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-31-Editing_and_clutch_hitting.html">173 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-31-Editing and clutch hitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regarding  editing :  The only serious editing I’ve ever received has been for my New York Times op-eds and my article in the American Scientist.  My book editors have all been nice people, and they’ve helped me with many things (including suggestions of what my priorities should be in communicating with readers)–they’ve been great–but they’ve not given (nor have I expected or asked for) serious editing.  Maybe I should’ve asked for it, I don’t know.  I’ve had time-wasting experiences with copy editors and a particularly annoying experience with a production editor (who was so difficult that my coauthors and I actually contacted our agent and a lawyer about the possibility of getting out of our contract), but that’s another story.
 
Regarding  clutch hitting , Bill James once noted that it’s great when a Bucky Dent hits an unexpected home run, but what’s really special is being able to get the big hit when it’s expected of you.

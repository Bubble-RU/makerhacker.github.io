<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: Xian posts his  memories  of Julian Besag, who is perhaps most famous for publishing the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (see  here  for some background).  I met Besag in 1989 when I spoke at the University of Washington; also I have a memory of a conference in 1992 or 1993, I think it was, when he objected strongly to my use of the chi-squared test to check the fit of a Bayesian model.  (In retrospect, I don’t think I presented my ideas clearly enough; some of the material in that talk ended up in  this article  with Meng and Stern.)  I also recall a talk I gave in Seattle around 1996, when Besag commented that the models I was using for spatial analysis were pretty crude–a fair comment, actually.  I don’t actually recall any of Besag’s lectures, but I read many of his papers.  As Xian said, Besag did innovative and important work on spatial statistics, work that will be long used and remembered.  He was in many ways ahead of his time and was a rarity in his generation of Bayesian statist</p><p>6 0.10297728 <a title="467-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-26-If_statistics_is_so_significantly_great%2C_why_don%E2%80%99t_statisticians_use_statistics%3F.html">51 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-26-If statistics is so significantly great, why don’t statisticians use statistics?</a></p>

Are you familiar with Miller and Chapman’s (2001)  article : Misunderstanding Analysis of Covariance saying that ANCOVA (and therefore, I suppose regression) should not be used when groups differ on a covariate.    It has caused a moderate splash in psychology circles.  I wondered if you had any thoughts on it.
  
I had not heard of the article so I followed the link . . . ugh!  Already on the very first column of the very first page they confuse nonadditivity with nonlinearity.  I could probably continue with, “and it gets worse,” but since nobody’s paying me to read this one, I’ll stop reading right there on the first page!

<p>Introduction: From  a few years ago :
  
Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend  rewriting both articles from scratch , using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.


4. Now go back and write the literature review</p><p>6 0.56617439 <a title="467-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-14-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">2172 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-14-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>

I know that in art, quality and value are two very different things.  Still, I had to stop and wonder when I read about

 
Domenico and Eleanore De Sole, who in 2004 paid $8.3 million for a painting attributed to Mark Rothko that they now say is a worthless fake.
 

One day a painting is worth $8.3 million; the next day, the same painting – same quality, same capacity to give aesthetic pleasure or do whatever it is that art does – is “worthless.”*  Art forgery also makes me wonder about the buyer’s motive.  If the buyer wanted only to have and to gaze upon something beautiful, something with artistic merit, then a fake Rothko is no different than a real Rothko.  It seems more likely that what the buyer wants is to own something valuable – i.e., something that costs a lot. Displaying your brokerage account statements is just too crude and obvious.  What the high-end art market offers is a kind of money laundering.

Lots of people sharing  this  today.


Isn’t this exactly the kind of situation where they should have done some kind of shrinkage towards the national mean, as in that thing you wrote about kidney cancer rates by county? i.e. you see, just as you might expect, the extreme values of “proportion of people who said they were gay” are disproportionately taken by small states.
  
My reply:
 
If I don’t have the individual-level survey data that would allow me to do full-scale  Mister P , yes, I’d fit a multilevel model to the state-level averages.  I wouldn’t quite just partially pool toward the national mean; I think it would make sense to include some state-level predictors.
 
In any case, I think it’s tacky to report poll numbers to fractional percentage points.  That kind of precision simply isn’t there.

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.  I likened their paper to other work which I considered flawed for multiple comparisons (too many researcher degrees of freedom), including a claimed relation bet</p><p>5 0.93785226 <a title="467-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-Peer_pressure%2C_selection%2C_and_educational_reform.html">326 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-Peer pressure, selection, and educational reform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Partly in response to my blog on the Harlem Children’s Zone study, Mark Palko wrote  this :
  
Talk of education reform always makes me [Palko] deeply nervous. Part of the anxiety comes having spent a number of years behind the podium and having seen the disparity between the claims and the reality of previous reforms. The rest comes from being a statistician and knowing what things like convergence can do to data.


Convergent behavior violates the assumption of independent observations used in most simple analyses, but educational studies commonly, perhaps even routinely ignore the complex ways that social norming can cause the nesting of student performance data.


In other words, educational research is often based of the idea that teenagers do not respond to peer pressure. . . .
  
and  this :
  
 
When you isolate a group of students, they will quickly arrive at a consensus of what constitutes normal behavior. It is a complex and somewhat unpredictable process driven by personali</p><p>6 0.93725526 <a title="467-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-31-Jessica_Tracy_and_Alec_Beall_%28authors_of_the_fertile-women-wear-pink_study%29_comment_on_our_Garden_of_Forking_Paths_paper%2C_and_I_comment_on_their_comments.html">2355 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-31-Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall (authors of the fertile-women-wear-pink study) comment on our Garden of Forking Paths paper, and I comment on their comments</a></p>

</p><p>5 It is not obvious to me [Sethi] that this process of evaluation is any less legitimate than that for journal submissions, which rely on feedback from two or three anonymous referees who are themselves invested in the same techniques and research agenda as the author. [sent-8, score-0.39]
</p><p>6 I don’t disagree with these sentiments, although I do think that, if blogging every becomes important in statistics, it will come much slower than in economics, political science, computer science, or even mathematics. [sent-9, score-0.408]
</p><p>7 But in all these years, very few statistics blogs have achieved much attention. [sent-11, score-0.397]
</p><p>8 Sethi points out that, compared to journal articles, blog entries can be subject to more effective criticism. [sent-12, score-0.535]
</p><p>9 In contrast, the journal reviewing process is very slow, and once an article is published, it typically just sits there. [sent-14, score-0.323]

</p><p>11 The field of statistics appears to accept that articles are attempts rather than realizations of perfection, whereas my impression is the economists worship at the altar of the “home run,” the article that is such a perfect jewel that it is beyond criticism. [sent-17, score-0.396]
</p><p>12 And when it comes to pure ridicule (I think you know who I’m thinking of here), maybe blogging is actually more appropriate than formally writing a letter to the editor of a journal. [sent-21, score-0.345]
</p><p>13 But I don’t know if blogs are the best place for technical discussions. [sent-22, score-0.462]

</p><p>17 From another direction, I think Scott Sumner’s econ blogging succeeds because it is well-written and because it supports a fiscally-conservative position that many people want to hear. [sent-37, score-0.646]
</p><p>18 Krugman’s blog works because it’s linked to a popular New York Times column and he takes a strongly partisan political stance, and Levitt and Dubner’s blog succeeds along the same lines as Cowen and Tabarrok’s–readers are getting a mix of news, provocation, and bite-sized analyses.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  quotes  Bentley University economics professor Scott Sumner  writing  on the first anniversary of his blog:
  
Be careful what you wish for.  Last February 2nd I [Sumner] started this blog with very low expectations… I knew I wasn’t a good writer . . . And I was also pretty sure that the content was not of much interest to anyone.


Now my biggest problem is time–I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the blog, seven days a week.  Several hours are spent responding to reader comments and the rest is spent writing long-winded posts and checking other economics blogs. . . .


I [Sumner] don’t think much of the official methodology in macroeconomics.  Many of my fellow economists seem to have a Popperian view of the social sciences.  You develop a model.  You go out and get some data.  And then you try to refute the model with some sort of regression analysis. . . .


My problem with this view is that it doesn’t reflect the way macro and finance actually work.  Instead the models are</p><p>3 0.22388105 <a title="120-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I encourage you to check out our  linked blogs .  Here’s what they’re all about:
 
 Cognitive and Behavioral Science 
 
 BPS Research Digest :  I haven’t been following this one recently, but it has lots of good links, I should probably check it more often.  There are a couple things that bother me, though.  The blog is sponsored by the British Psychological Society, so this sounds pretty serious.  But then they run things like advertising  promotions  sponsored by a textbook company and highlight iffy experimental claims.  For example, in 2010 they ran a wholly uncritical  post  on the notorious Daryl Bem study that purported to find ESP.  After being called on it in the comments, the blogger (Christian Jarrett) responded with, “The stats appear sound. . . . it’s a great study. Rigorously conducted” and even defended “the discussion of quantum physics in the paper.”  To be fair, though, and as he  points out  in comments, Jarrett wrote of Bem’s study:  “this isn’t proof of psi, far fr</p><p>5 0.16986544 <a title="120-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-02-Fragment_of_statistical_autobiography.html">390 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-02-Fragment of statistical autobiography</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I studied math and physics at MIT. To be more precise, I started in math as default–ever since I was two years old, I’ve thought of myself as a mathematician, and I always did well in math class, so it seemed like a natural fit.
 
But I was concerned. In high school I’d been in the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad training program, and there I’d met kids who were clearly much much better at math than I was. In retrospect, I don’t think I was as bad as I’d thought at the time: there were 24 kids in the program, and I was probably around #20, if that, but I think a lot of the other kids had more practice working on “math olympiad”-type problems. Maybe I was really something like the tenth-best in the group.
 
Tenth-best or twentieth-best, whatever it was, I reached a crisis of confidence around my sophomore or junior year in college. At MIT, I started right off taking advanced math classes, and somewhere along the way I realized I wasn’t seeing the big picture. I was able to do the homework pr</p><p>6 0.169742 <a title="120-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-11-What_if_I_were_to_stop_publishing_in_journals%3F.html">2244 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-11-What if I were to stop publishing in journals?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In our recent discussion of modes of publication, Joseph Wilson wrote, “The single best reform science can make right now is to decouple publication from career advancement, thereby reducing the number of publications by an order of magnitude and then move to an entirely disjointed, informal, online free-for-all communication system for research results.”
 
My first thought on this was: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. But then I got to thinking: what would it  really  mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me—I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future—but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).
 
However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should’ve just typed it all in then.

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  blog post  by Phil Davis on “the emergence of a citation cartel.”  Davis tells the story: 
  
  
Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived.

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>6 0.77638805 <a title="120-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-17-The_Washington_Post_reprints_university_press_releases_without_editing_them.html">2215 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-17-The Washington Post reprints university press releases without editing them</a></p>

What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  writes :
  
I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed.

<p>Introduction: How am I supposed to handle this sort of thing?  (See below.)  I just stuck it one of my email folders without responding, but then I wondered . . . what’s it all about?  Is there some sort of Glengarry Glen Ross-like parallel world where down-on-their-luck Jack Lemmons of public relations world send out electronic cold calls?  More than anything else, this sort of thing makes me glad I have a steady job.

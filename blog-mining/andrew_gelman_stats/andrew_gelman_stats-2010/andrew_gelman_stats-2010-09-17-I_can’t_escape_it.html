<p>Introduction: Nick Cox  comments :
  
I heard of a leading U.S. statistician who delegates some of his book reviews to smart graduate students. The (very grateful) ex-student who told me said, in effect, it’s just his way of working. He makes the deal evident beforehand and makes it up to you in other ways by superb mentoring.
  
I don’t understand this at all!  If the student wrote the review, he or she should be sole author, no?  The thing that puzzles me about this story is that if you’re a “leading statistician,” you don’t really get any credit for reviewing.  If anything, people probably think you’re writing reviews as a way to avoid doing real work.  If there’s some concern that the journal won’t publish a review under the sole authorship of obscure student X, they could always compromise and include the senior prof as a second author on the review (in which case the prof should at least  read  the review and vet it, but that can’t take much time).
 
I guess what I’m saying is that it makes pe</p><p>3 0.1471339 <a title="282-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-23-Tables_%3E_figures_yet_again.html">2111 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-23-Tables > figures yet again</a></p>

A journal editor made me change all my figures into tables.  I complied, but I sent along one of your papers on the topic of figures versus tables.  I got the following email in response which I thought you’d find funny:

 
Yes, statisticians prefer figures over tables.  However, you are not writing this manuscript for statisticians.  Your audience will be clinicians, nurses, epidemiologists and public health professionals.
 
  
The funny thing is, I think of biomedical journals (Jama, etc) as being pretty good about using graphs to convey their main results.  They’re not as good as physicists, but they’re often better than statisticians!</p><p>4 0.14659655 <a title="282-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-14-The_statistics_and_the_science.html">146 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-14-The statistics and the science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  posted  a review of a submitted manuscript where I first wrote that I read the paper only shallowly and then followed up with some suggestions on the statistical analysis, recommending that overdispersion be added to a fitted Posson regression and that the table of regression results be supplemented with a graph showing data and fitted lines.
 
A commenter asked why I wrote such an apparently shallow review, and I realized that some of the implications of my review were not as clear as I’d thought.  So let me clarify.
 
There is a connection between my general reaction and my statistical comments.  My statistical advice here is relevant for (at least) two reasons.  First, a Poisson regression without overdispersion will give nearly-uninterpretable standard errors, which means that I have no sense if the results are statistically significant as claimed.  Second, with a time series plot and regression table, but no graph showing the estimated treatment effect, it is very dif</p><p>5 0.13494514 <a title="282-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-17-Joanne_Gowa_scooped_me_by_22_years_in_my_criticism_of_Axelrod%E2%80%99s_Evolution_of_Cooperation.html">348 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-17-Joanne Gowa scooped me by 22 years in my criticism of Axelrod’s Evolution of Cooperation</a></p>

Dear Colleague,


Recently we informed you about SciRev, our new website where researchers can share their experiences with the peer review process and select an efficient journal for submitting their work. 


Since our start, we already received over 500 reviews and many positive reactions, which reveal a great need for comparable information on duration and quality of the review process. All reviews are publicly available on our website, both at the pages of the journals and in an overview at www.scirev.sc/reviews


To make this venture a success, many reviews are needed. We therefore would appreciate it very much if you could take a few minutes to visit our website www.SciRev.sc and share your recent review experiences with your colleagues.


SciRev also offers you the possibility to create a free account where you can administer your manuscripts under review and create a personal journal list.


Thanks on behalf of the research community, 
Jan</p><p>3 0.68514121 <a title="282-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Clarity_on_my_email_policy.html">503 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Clarity on my email policy</a></p>

Mimi Liljeholm has sent you a message. Please click ‘Reply’ to send a direct response.


Dear Prof Gelman,


In collaboration with Frontiers in Psychology, we are organizing a Research Topic titled “Causal discovery and generalization”, hosted by Mimi Liljeholm and Marc Buehner.  As host editor, I would like to encourage you to contribute to this topic.


A brief description of the topic is provided on our homepage on the Frontiers website (section “Frontiers in Cognition”).  This is also where all articles will appear after peer-review and where participants in the topic will be able to hold relevant discussions: http://www.frontiersin.org/Cognition/researchtopics/Causal_discovery_and_generaliz/1906

<p>Introduction: This assessment  by Tyler Cowen reminded me that, in 1980, I and just about all my friends hated Jimmy Carter.  Most of us much preferred him to Reagan but still hated Carter.  I wouldn’t associate this with any particular ideological feeling—it’s not that we thought he was too liberal, or too conservative.  He just seemed completely ineffectual.  I remember feeling at the time that he had no principles, that he’d do anything to get elected.
 
In retrospect, I think of this as an instance of uniform partisan swing:  the president was unpopular nationally, and attitudes about him were negative, relatively speaking, among just about every group.
 
My other Carter story comes from a conversation I had a couple years ago with an economist who’s about my age, a man who said that one reason he and his family moved from town A to town B in his metropolitan area was that, in town B, they didn’t feel like they were the only Republicans on their block.
 
Anyway, this guy described himself as a “</p><p>4 0.86887813 <a title="282-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-24-Sometimes_the_raw_numbers_are_better_than_a_percentage.html">108 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-24-Sometimes the raw numbers are better than a percentage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  NY Times Environment blog entry  summarizes an  article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  that looks into whether there really is a “scientific consensus” that humans are substantially changing the climate.  There is.  That’s pretty much “dog bites man” as far as news is concerned.  But although the results of the study don’t seem noteworthy, I was struck by this paragraph in the blog writeup, which is pretty much a quote of the PNAS article:
  
For example, of the top 50 climate researchers identified by the study (as ranked by the number of papers they had published), only 2 percent fell into the camp of climate dissenters. Of the top 200 researchers, only 2.5 percent fell into the dissenter camp. That is consistent with past work, including opinion polls, suggesting that 97 to 98 percent of working climate scientists accept the evidence for human-induced climate change.
  
Two percent of the top 50, that’s one person.  And 2.5 percent of the top 200, that’s five</p><p>5 0.8686884 <a title="282-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-Where_do_theories_come_from%3F.html">1861 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-Where do theories come from?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lee Sechrest sends along  this article  by Brian Haig and writes that it “presents what seems to me a useful perspective on much of what scientists/statisticians do and how science works, at least in the fields in which I work.”  Here’s Haig’s abstract: 
  
  
A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

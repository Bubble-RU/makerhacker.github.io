I’ll give my reply (my friend preferred that I not quote his email, but you can get a general sense of the questions from my answers).  But first let me point you to my original post,  Freakonomics 2: What went wrong? , from a couple years ago, in which I raised many of the points that ultimately went into our article.
 
And here’s my recent note.  (I numbered my points, but the email I was replying to was not numbered.  This is not a point-by-point rebuttal to anything but rather just a series of remarks.) 
   
1.  Both Kaiser and I are big fans of Freakonomics.  It’s only because Levitt can (and has) done better, that we’re sad when he doesn’t live up to his own high standards.  If we didn’t convey this sense of respect in our American Scientist article, that is our failing.

<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>5 0.264496 <a title="334-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-10-Update_on_Levitt_paper_on_child_car_seats.html">1491 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-10-Update on Levitt paper on child car seats</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  noted  the following quote from applied microeconomist Steven Levitt:
  
Is it surprising that scientists would try to keep work that disagrees with their findings out of journals? When I told my father that I [Levitt] was sending my work saying car seats are not that effective to medical journals, he laughed and said they would never publish it because of the result, no matter how well done the analysis was. (As is so often the case, he was right, and I eventually published it in an economics journal.)


Within the field of economics, academics work behind the scenes constantly trying to undermine each other. I’ve seen economists do far worse things than pulling tricks in figures. When economists get mixed up in public policy, things get messier.
  
At the time, I expressed dismay about Levitt’s air of (as I read it) amused, world-weary tolerance of scientists behaving against the interest of science.  But I took his story about the car seats at face value.

<p>Introduction: After seeing  this graph :
 
   
 
I have the following message for Sharad:
 
Rotate the graph 90 degrees so you can see the words.  Also you can ditch the lines.  Then what you have is a dotplot, following the principles of Cleveland (1985).  You can lay out a few on one page to see some interactions with demographics.
 
 The real challenge here . . . 
 
. . . is to automate this sort of advice.  Or maybe we just need a really nice dotplot() function and enough examples, and people will start doing it?
 
 P.S. 
 
Often a lineplot is better.

Diamond often would fall asleep in seminars, often for large chunks of time. What was amazing, however, is that he would open his eyes and then make by far the most insightful comment of the entire seminar!
 

 
Now that we have n=2 [see the first part of the title of this blog entry], I’m wondering . . . maybe this sort of thing is more common than Levitt and I had realized.
 
P.S.  Levitt also writes:
  
The one thing that puzzles me [Levitt] is why in the world would he want to be on the Board of the Federal Reserve? One thing economists just don’t understand are people’s preferences.
  
To get meta here for a moment . . . just as Levitt can’t understand Diamond’s preferences, I find it extremely difficult to understand that Levitt is puzzled by Diamond’s desire to serve on the Federal Reserve,
 
It’s obvious, no?  Diamond has expertise on macroeconomics and, I assume, some strong and well-informed opinions on monetary policy; the Federal Reserve determ</p><p>3 0.93810582 <a title="334-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-25-And_now%2C_here%E2%80%99s_something_we_hope_you%E2%80%99ll_really_like.html">1343 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-25-And now, here’s something we hope you’ll really like</a></p>

Postdoctoral Researcher (3 years) in State-Space Modeling of Animal Movement and Population Dynamics in Universities of Turku and Helsinki, Finland


We seek for a statistician/mathematician with experience in ecological modeling or an ecologist with strong quantitative training to join an interdisciplinary research team focusing on dispersal and dynamics of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans).


The Postdoctoral Researcher will develop modeling approaches (from individual based models to population level models) to assess the dispersal and population dynamics of the flying squirrel. A key challenge will be the integration of different kinds of data (census data, telemetry data, mark-recapture data, life-history data, and data on environmental covariates such as forest structure) into the modeling framework using Bayesian State-Space models or other such approaches.


The project will be supervised by Dr. Vesa Selonen (a flying squirrel specialist;</p><p>4 0.92395228 <a title="334-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-13-Visualization_in_1939.html">31 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-13-Visualization in 1939</a></p>

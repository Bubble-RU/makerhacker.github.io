Peterson Foundation, an  organization  formed by the former advertising executive, Secretary of Commerce, and investment banker to focus attention on the national debt.
 
Sides, Page, and Jacobs discuss three key points:
  

 
1. Any poll or focus group is only as good as its sample, and there is no evidence that the participants in the America Speaks forums were selected in a way to be representative of the nation.  Page and Jacobs write:
  
Deliberative forums often fail to get a representative sample of Americans to participate, even when they try hard to do so. Worse, some deliberative forums make little or no serious effort to achieve representativeness.

</p><p>4 Worse, some deliberative forums make little or no serious effort to achieve representativeness. [sent-6, score-0.69]
</p><p>5 The result can be an extremely skewed, unrepresentative picture of “public opinion” that little resembles the actual views of the American public as a whole. [sent-8, score-0.403]
</p><p>6 Actual public opinion on economic policy, as measured by representative samples, is much  more concerned  about jobs and economic growth than about deficits. [sent-13, score-0.69]
</p><p>7 This is not to deny concerns about deficits–in particular, a voter can be primarily concerned about jobs and the economy but, at the same time, feel that deficit spending is not a good economic plan. [sent-14, score-0.512]
</p><p>8 If, for example, you feel that we cannot simply spend our way out of a recession, you might strongly support measures to reduce the deficit–even while still feeling that jobs and the economy are the #1 concern. [sent-15, score-0.183]
</p><p>9 Political actors, not impartial measurement devices    Sides, Page, and Jacobs make a convincing argument that the America Speaks forums, as currently designed, are a pretty useless way to assess public opinion, “deliberative” or otherwise. [sent-16, score-0.303]
</p><p>10 As noted above, the Peterson Foundation is not playing the role of an impartial research organization here. [sent-18, score-0.176]
</p><p>11 Now, sure, just about anyone who goes to the trouble of studying public opinion has political views, often strong ones–otherwise, why study opinion in the first place. [sent-19, score-0.57]
</p><p>12 As Page and Jacobs note, it’s not just that Peter Peterson is a fiscally conservative Republican, it’s that his foundation is specifically focused on deficit reduction, which in turn is the topic of their study. [sent-24, score-0.414]
</p><p>13 The right way to think about the America Speaks forum, I think, is not as an attempt to  measure  public opinion but rather as an attempt to  influence  public opinion. [sent-25, score-0.738]
</p><p>14 As Jacobs and Shapiro write in Politicians Don’t Pander, political actors often view public oipinion not as a fixed constraint but instead as a tool that they can use to influence policy. [sent-26, score-0.403]
</p><p>15 From this perspective, we can think of the Peterson Foundation forums as having three purposes:   - Getting publicity for the idea of cutting social spending for deficit reduction. [sent-27, score-0.734]
</p><p>16 The forums are big public events; just reporting them in the media can help keep the deficits issue on the front burner. [sent-28, score-0.73]
</p><p>17 The organizers of the forum can see what messages seem to be effective in changing people’s opinions, then they can later roll out revised versions of these messages in ads, campaign pitches, and so forth. [sent-30, score-0.234]
</p><p>18 If this unrepresentative sample, primed to focus on the deficit, ends up the views presented as centrist compromises by the Peterson Foundation, these results can be released to the news media and used by sympathetic poliiticians to emphasize the electoral viability of cuts in social spending. [sent-32, score-0.405]
</p><p>19 Even if you view these forums as nothing but a publicity stunt–and they’re clearly more than that–it’s perfectly legitimate and expected for advocacy organizations to spend their resources in an attempt to inlfuence policy. [sent-34, score-0.685]
</p><p>20 I just think it’s more helpful to frame these forums in that way, rather than as a method (flawed or otherwise) to estimate public opinion. [sent-35, score-0.588]

<p>Introduction: Nadia Hassan writes:
  
In your  review  of the Jacobs and Page book, you argued that while there was an open question of whether government could give voters what they wanted in light of the tax increases they might accept, Jacobs and Page were pretty persuasive about targeted tax hikes and specific programs especially against the freeloader view.  Recent discussions, and some focus groups  bear out these points exactly.

<p>Introduction: My article with Daniel and Yair  has recently appeared in The Forum:
  
We use multilevel modeling to estimate support for health-care reform by age, income, and state. Opposition to reform is concentrated among higher-income voters and those over 65. Attitudes do not vary much by state. Unfortunately, our poll data only go to 2004, but we suspect that much can be learned from the relative positions of different demographic groups and different states, despite swings in national opinion. We speculate on the political implications of these findings.
  
The article features some pretty graphs that originally appeared on the blog.
 
It’s in a special issue on health care politics that has several interesting articles, among which I’d like to single out  this one  by Bob Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs entitled, “Simulating Representation: Elite Mobilization and Political Power in Health Care Reform”:

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.10298067 <a title="113-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-Panel_Thurs_2_Dec_on_politics_and_deficit_reduction_in_NYC.html">435 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-Panel Thurs 2 Dec on politics and deficit reduction in NYC</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We all have opinions about the federal budget and how it should be spent. Infrequently, those opinions are informed by some knowledge about where the money actually goes.  It turns out that most people don’t have a clue.  What about you?  Here, take this poll/quiz and then compare your answers to (1) what other people said, in a CNN poll that asked about these same items and (2) compare your answers to the real answers.
 
Quiz is below the fold.
  

 
The questions below are from  a CNN poll.  
 
========
 
Think about all the money that the federal government spent last year. I’m going to name a few federal programs and for each one, I’d like you to estimate what percentage of the federal government’s budget last year was spent on each of those programs.
  
 Medicare — the federal health program for the elderly 
 Medicaid — the federal health program for the poor 
 Social Security

<p>Introduction: Respected political scientist Tim Groseclose just came out with a book, “Left Turn:  How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.”  I was familiar with Groseclose’s article (with Jeffrey Milyo) on media bias that came out several years ago–it was an interesting study but I was not convinced by its central claim that they were measuring an absolute level of bias–and then recently heard about this new book in the context of some  intemperate  things Groseclose said in a interview on the conservative Fox TV network.
 
Groseclose’s big conclusion is that in the absence of media bias, the average American voter would be positioned at around 25 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is a right-wing Republican and 100 is a left-wing Democrat.  (Seeing as the number line is conventionally drawn from left to right, I think it would make more sense for 0 to represent the left and 100 to be on the right, but I guess it’s too late for him to change now.)  Groseclose places the average voter now at around</p><p>6 0.6823386 <a title="113-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-22-%E2%80%9CHow_has_your_thinking_changed_over_the_past_three_years%3F%E2%80%9D.html">585 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-22-“How has your thinking changed over the past three years?”</a></p>

The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>2 0.9512611 <a title="113-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-The_consulting_biz.html">1618 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-The consulting biz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Sides   reports on  a paper by Benjamin Page and Lawrence Jacobs about so-called deliberative forums, in particular a set of meetings called America Speaks that have been organized and conducted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an  organization  formed by the former advertising executive, Secretary of Commerce, and investment banker to focus attention on the national debt.
 
Sides, Page, and Jacobs discuss three key points:
  

 
1. Any poll or focus group is only as good as its sample, and there is no evidence that the participants in the America Speaks forums were selected in a way to be representative of the nation.  Page and Jacobs write:
  
Deliberative forums often fail to get a representative sample of Americans to participate, even when they try hard to do so. Worse, some deliberative forums make little or no serious effort to achieve representativeness. They throw open the doors to self-selected political activists with extreme opinions, or they compile a secret list</p><p>4 0.92976093 <a title="113-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-Going_negative.html">1918 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-Going negative</a></p>

I have measured total phosphorus, TP, on a number of dialysis patients, and also measured conventional phosphate, Pi. Now P is exchanged with the environment as Pi, so in principle a correlation between TP and Pi could perhaps be expected. I’m really most interested in the fraction of TP which is not Pi, that is TP-Pi. I would also expect that to be positively correlated with Pi. However, looking at the data using a mixed model an insignificant negative correlation is obtained. Then I thought, that since TP-Pi is bound to be small if Pi is large a negative correlation is almost dictated by the math even if the biology would have it otherwise in so far as the the TP-Pi, likely organic P, must someday have been Pi. Hence I thought about correcting the slight negative correlation between TP-Pi and Pi for the expected large negative correlation due to the math – to eventually recover what I came from: a positive correlation. People seems to agree that this thinki</p><p>5 0.92811525 <a title="113-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-R_sucks.html">1919 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-R sucks</a></p>

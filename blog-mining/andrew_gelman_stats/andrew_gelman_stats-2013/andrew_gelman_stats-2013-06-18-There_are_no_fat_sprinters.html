A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.

</p><p>4 People who suggested my weight would return were wrong, at least so far. [sent-8, score-0.509]
</p><p>5 During that time I’ve gotten my heart rate close to my maximum twice a week or more in most weeks, by riding up steep hills as hard as I can. [sent-10, score-0.559]
</p><p>6 Of course I’m also getting other exercise on my bike — I ride for hours sometimes — but for reasons described in that previous post I think it’s the high-intensity exercise that has a big effect on my weight. [sent-13, score-1.042]
</p><p>7 A few legs of the route are pretty intimidating — long, steep climbs at fairly high elevation — so after signing up for the trip I started training more: getting an hour ride in before work, riding farther and harder on weekends, etc. [sent-15, score-0.69]
</p><p>8 After a couple of months I was a stronger biker than ever, but my weight was still around 193-195 pounds. [sent-16, score-0.526]
</p><p>9 I’ve never been concerned about weight loss per se; I think of it as an unintended (but welcome) consequence of my activities. [sent-18, score-0.695]
</p><p>10 But about a month and a half after I started training for my trip I was chatting with a biking friend who is much faster and fitter than me, and who weighs even less than Taylor Phinney in spite of being almost my height, and he suggested I lose some weight before my Pyrenees ride. [sent-20, score-0.825]
</p><p>11 I told him that although it would be great to haul 10 fewer pounds of fat over every mountain with me, I wasn’t willing to diet to do it. [sent-21, score-0.543]
</p><p>12 But, upon reflection, I did decide to try to do two things to see if I could lose weight before my big ride: (1) reach my max heart rate 3 or 4 days per week instead of 2, and (2) weigh myself every morning. [sent-23, score-0.99]

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
The New York Times recently ran an article entitled  “How Exercise Can Help Us Eat Less,”  which begins with this: “Strenuous exercise seems to dull the urge to eat afterward better than gentler workouts, several new studies show, adding to a growing body of science suggesting that intense exercise may have unique benefits.” The article is based on a couple of recent studies in which moderately overweight volunteers participated in different types of exercise, and had their food intake monitored at a subsequent meal.
 
The article also says “[The volunteers] also displayed significantly lower levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is known to stimulate appetite, and elevated levels of both blood lactate and blood sugar, which have been shown to lessen the drive to eat, after the most vigorous interval session than after the other workouts. And the appetite-suppressing effect of the highly intense intervals lingered into the next day, according to food diarie</p><p>3 0.20605955 <a title="1905-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Massive_confusion_about_a_study_that_purports_to_show_that_exercise_may_increase_heart_risk.html">1364 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Massive confusion about a study that purports to show that exercise may increase heart risk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

Rink Hoekstra and I are undertaking some research to explore how people use classical statistical results to evaluate the weight of evidence. Bayesians often critique classical techniques for being difficult to interpret in terms of what scientists want to know, but there is clearly information in the statistics themselves. We wonder how people extract that information. Below is our official announcement; it would be great if you could let people on your blog know about the survey, as we want to get a wide variety of statistical users to take the survey.


Announcement follows:

 
Empirical science is grounded on the belief that data can be used as evidence. The convincingness of data — the “weight” of the evidence they provide — is crucial to deciding between rival scientific positions. In situations with no uncertainty, reasoning about evidence is often straightforward; in practice, however, most conclusions from data involve uncertainty.

<p>Introduction: 14. A public health survey of elderly Americans includes many questions, including “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” and also several questions about current mobility and health status. Response rates are high for the questions about recent activities and status, but there is a lot of nonresponse for the question on past activity. You are considering imputing the missing values on the question, “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” Which of the following statements are basically correct? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If done reasonably well, imputation is preferred to available-case and complete-case analysis.
 
(b) If you do impute, you should also present the available-case and complete-case analysis and analyze how the imputed estimates differ.
 
(c) It is OK to include current health status variables as predictors in a model imputing past activities: anything that adds informati</p><p>6 0.13016483 <a title="1905-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-01-A_randomized_trial_of_the_set-point_diet.html">1239 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-01-A randomized trial of the set-point diet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).


 Design:  Randomized clinica</p><p>4 0.71719474 <a title="1905-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-Lottery_probability_update.html">731 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-Lottery probability update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It was reported  last year  that the national lottery of Israel featured the exact same 6 numbers (out of 45) twice in the same month, and statistics professor Isaac Meilijson of Tel Aviv University was quoted as saying that “the incident of six numbers repeating themselves within a month is an event of once in 10,000 years.”
 
I shouldn’t mock when it comes to mathematics–after all, I proved a false theorem once!  (Or, to be precise, my collaborator and I published a false claim which we thought we’d proved, thus we thought was a theorem.)
 
So let me retract the mockery and move, first to the mathematics and then to the statistics.

<p>Introduction: Alexander at GiveWell  writes :
  
The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>6 0.70559615 <a title="1905-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-News_coverage_of_statistical_issues%E2%80%A6how_did_I_do%3F.html">514 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-News coverage of statistical issues…how did I do?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.

The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)

<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>5 0.93616813 <a title="1905-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel_modeling_and_instrumental_variables.html">1468 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel modeling and instrumental variables</a></p>

I was wondering if multilevel models can be used as an alternative to 2SLS or IV models to deal with (i) endogeneity and (ii) selection problems.


More concretely, I am trying to assess the impact of investment treaties on foreign investment. Aside from the fact that foreign investment is correlated over time, it may be the case that countries that already receive sufficient amounts of foreign investment need not sign treaties, and countries that sign treaties are those that need foreign investment in the first place. Countries thus “select” into treatment; treaty signing is non-random. As such, I argue that to properly estimate the impact of treaties on investment, we must model the determinants of treaty signing.


I [Teo] am currently modeling this as two separate models: (1) regress predictors on likelihood of treaty signing, (2) regress treaty (with interactions, etc) on investment (I’ve thought of using propensity score matching for this part of the model)</p><p>same-blog 6 0.92824709 <a title="1905-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-18-There_are_no_fat_sprinters.html">1905 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-18-There are no fat sprinters</a></p>

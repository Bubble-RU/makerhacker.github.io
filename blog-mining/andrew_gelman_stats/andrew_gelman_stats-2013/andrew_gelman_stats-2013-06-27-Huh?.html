<p>Introduction: Earlier today I  posted  a weird email that began with “You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years” and continued with a sleazy attempt to squeeze $1000 out of me so that an article that I sent them for free could be available to the public.  $1000 might seem like a lot, but they assured me that “we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate.”  Sort of like a Vegematic but without that set of Ginsu knives thrown in for free.
 
But then when I was responding to comments, I realized that . . . I didn’t actually remember ever publishing anything in that journal.  It’s not on my list of 100+ journals.  I did a search on my published papers page and couldn’t find anything closer than the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health (and that was not within the last few years).

<p>Introduction: In our recent discussion of modes of publication, Joseph Wilson wrote, “The single best reform science can make right now is to decouple publication from career advancement, thereby reducing the number of publications by an order of magnitude and then move to an entirely disjointed, informal, online free-for-all communication system for research results.”
 
My first thought on this was: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. But then I got to thinking: what would it  really  mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me—I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future—but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).
 
However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should’ve just typed it all in then.

Dear Colleague,


Recently we informed you about SciRev, our new website where researchers can share their experiences with the peer review process and select an efficient journal for submitting their work. 


Since our start, we already received over 500 reviews and many positive reactions, which reveal a great need for comparable information on duration and quality of the review process. All reviews are publicly available on our website, both at the pages of the journals and in an overview at www.scirev.sc/reviews


To make this venture a success, many reviews are needed. We therefore would appreciate it very much if you could take a few minutes to visit our website www.SciRev.sc and share your recent review experiences with your colleagues.


SciRev also offers you the possibility to create a free account where you can administer your manuscripts under review and create a personal journal list.


Thanks on behalf of the research community, 
Jan</p><p>5 0.77970719 <a title="1915-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-27-More_spam%21.html">1872 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-27-More spam!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following bizarre email:

Dear  Andrew Gelman


You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years. Currently, content on the Journal is closed access for the first 2 years after publication, and then freely accessible thereafter.  On June 1, 2013, the Journal will be extending its closed-access window from 2 years to 10 years. Extending this window will close public access to your article via the Journal web portal, but public access will still be available via the National Institutes of Health PubMedCentral web portal. 


If you would like to make your article available to the public for free on the Journal web portal, we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate of  $1,000 per article. If interested in purchasing this access, please contact Brian Selzer, Publications Editor, at brian.selzer@apha.org

Regular blog readers know all about this topic.  ( Here  are the slides.)  But, rest assured, I donâ&euro;&trade;t just mock. I also offer constructive suggestions.
 
My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.
 
P.S.  I searched on the web and also found  this announcement  which gives the wrong title.</p><p>4 0.7015909 <a title="1915-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-21-Workshop_on_science_communication_for_graduate_students.html">1687 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-21-Workshop on science communication for graduate students</a></p>

Applications are now open for the Communicating Science 2013 workshop (http://workshop.astrobites.com/), to be held in Cambridge, MA on June 13-15th, 2013.  Graduate students at US institutions in all fields of science and engineering are encouraged to apply â&euro;&ldquo; funding is available for travel expenses and accommodations.


The application can be found here: http://workshop.astrobites.org/application


Participants will build the communication skills that technical professionals need to express complex ideas to their peers, experts in other fields, and the general public.  There will be panel discussions on the following topics:


* Engaging Non-Scientific Audiences 
* Science Writing for a Cause 
* Communicating Science Through Fiction 
* Sharing Science with Scientists 
* The World of Non-Academic Publishing 
* Communicating using Multimedia and the Web


In addition to these discussions, ample time is allotted for interacting with the experts and with att</p><p>5 0.67869925 <a title="1915-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-29-World_Class_Speakers_and_Entertainers.html">1034 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-29-World Class Speakers and Entertainers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  our discussion  of historian Niall Ferguson and piss-poor monocausal social science, commenter Matt W. pointed to Ferguson’s listing at a speakers bureau.  One of his talks is entitled “Is This the Chinese Century?”  The question mark at the end seems to give him some wiggle room.
 
I give some paid lectures myself and was curious to learn more about this organization, World Class Speakers and Entertainers, so I clicked through to  this list of topics  and then searched for Statistics.  Amazingly enough, there was a “Statistician” category (right above “Story Teller / Lore / Art / Power of Story Telling,” “Strategist / Strategies / Strategic Planning,” and “Success”).
 
There I found  Gopal C. Dorai, Ph.D. , who offers insights such as “vegetarians usually will not eat meat products, no matter how hungry they feel.”  And “Cheating or lying for the sake of obtaining favorable treatment from others will be anathema to some people.”  And “Life is a one-way-street; we cannot turn the c</p><p>6 0.66519117 <a title="1915-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-16-A_poll_that_throws_away_data%3F%3F%3F.html">1940 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-16-A poll that throws away data???</a></p>

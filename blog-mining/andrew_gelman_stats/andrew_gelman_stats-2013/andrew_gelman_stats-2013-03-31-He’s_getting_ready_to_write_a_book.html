My co-author, Jacki Buros, and I [Novik] have just signed a contract with Apress to write a book tentatively entitled “Predictive Analytics with R”, which will cover programming best practices, data munging, data exploration, and single and multi-level models with case studies in social media, healthcare, politics, marketing, and the stock market.


Why does the world need another R book?  We think there is a shortage of books that deal with the complete and programmer centric analysis of real, dirty, and sometimes unstructured data.  Our target audience are people who have some familiarity with statistics, but do not have much experience with programming. . . .


The book is projected to be about 300 pages across 8 chapters. This is my first experience with writing a book and everything I heard about the process tells me that this is going to be a long and arduous endeavor lasting anywhere from 6 to 8 months.

I am writing to ask you to recommend papers, books–anything that comes to mind that might give a prospective statistician some sense of what the future holds for statistics (and statisticians). I have a liberal arts background with an emphasis in mathematics. It seems like this is an exciting time to be a statistician, but that’s just from the outside looking in. I’m curious about your perspective on the future of the discipline.
  
Any recommendations?  My favorite is still the book, “Statistics:  A Guide to the Unknown,” first edition.

<p>Introduction: Dave Decker writes:
  
I’ve seen some Bayes related things recently that might make for interesting fodder on your blog.


There are two books, teaching Bayesian analysis from a programming perspective.


And also a “web application for data analysis using powerful Bayesian statistical methods.”
  
   
I took a look.  The first book is  Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics Made Simple, by Allen B. Downey .  It’s super readable and, amazingly, has approximately zero overlap with Bayesian Data Analysis.  Downey discusses lots of little problems in a conversational way.  In some ways it’s like an old-style math stat textbook (although with a programming rather than mathematical flavor) in that the examples are designed for simplicity rather than realism.  I like it!  Our book already exists; it’s good to have something else for people to read, coming from an entirely different perspective.

So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

<p>Introduction: It worked on  this one .
 
Good maze designers know this trick and are careful to design multiple branches in each direction. Back when I was in junior high, I used to make huge mazes, and the basic idea was to anticipate what the solver might try to do and to make the maze difficult by postponing the point at which he would realize a path was going nowhere.  For example, you might have 6 branches:  one dead end, two pairs that form loops going back to the start, and one that is the correct solution.  You do this from both directions and add some twists and turns, and there you are.
 
But the maze designer aiming for the naive solver–the sap who starts from the entrance and goes toward the exit–can simplify matters by just having 6 branches:  five dead ends and one winner.  This sort of thing is easy to solve in the reverse direction.  I’m surprised the Times didn’t do better for their special puzzle issue.</p><p>3 0.94766611 <a title="1783-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-21-Class_on_computational_social_science_this_semester%2C_Fridays%2C_1%3A00-3%3A40pm.html">1685 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-21-Class on computational social science this semester, Fridays, 1:00-3:40pm</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When I spoke at Princeton last year, I talked with neuroscientist Sam Wang, who told me about a project he did surveying incoming Princeton freshmen about mental illness in their families.  He and his coauthor Benjamin Campbell found some interesting results, which they just  published :
  
A link between intellect and temperament has long been the subject of speculation. . . . Studies of the artistically inclined report linkage with familial depression, while among eminent and creative scientists, a lower incidence of affective disorders is found. In the case of developmental disorders, a heightened prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been found in the families of mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. . . .


We surveyed the incoming class of 2014 at Princeton University about their intended academic major, familial incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders, and demographic variables. . . . Consistent with prior findings, we noticed a relation between intended academ</p><p>5 0.94046146 <a title="1783-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-16-The_%E2%80%9Chot_hand%E2%80%9D_and_problems_with_hypothesis_testing.html">1215 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-16-The “hot hand” and problems with hypothesis testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Yaari  writes :
  
Anyone who has ever watched a sports competition is familiar with expressions like “on fire”, “in the zone”, “on a roll”, “momentum” and so on. But what do these expressions really mean? In 1985 when Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky  studied  this phenomenon for the first time, they defined it as: “. . . these phrases express a belief that the performance of a player during a particular period is significantly better than expected on the basis of the player’s overall record”. Their conclusion was that what people tend to perceive as a “hot hand” is essentially a cognitive illusion caused by a misperception of random sequences. Until recently there was little, if any, evidence to rule out their conclusion. Increased computing power and new data availability from various sports now provide surprising evidence of this phenomenon, thus reigniting the debate.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.
 
The question then arises:  why do descriptions of data science focus so</p><p>3 0.12841836 <a title="1837-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-19-More_on_%E2%80%9Cdata_science%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Cstatistics%E2%80%9D.html">2106 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-19-More on “data science” and “statistics”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading Rachel and Cathy’s  book , I  wrote  that “Statistics is the least important part of data science . . . I think it would be fair to consider statistics as a subset of data science. . . . it’s not the most important part of data science, or even close.”
 
But then I received “Data Science for Business,” by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett, in the mail.  I might not have opened the book at all (as I’m hardly in the target audience) but for seeing a blurb by Chris Volinsky, a statistician whom I respect a lot.
 
So I flipped through the book and it indeed looked pretty good.  It moves slowly but that’s appropriate for an intro book.  But what surprised me, given the book’s title and our recent discussion on the nature of data science, was that the book was 100% statistics!

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

Participants will build the communication skills that technical professionals need to express complex ideas to their peers, experts in other fields, and the general public.  There will be panel discussions on the following topics:


* Engaging Non-Scientific Audiences 
* Science Writing for a Cause

<p>Introduction: Rick Lightburn writes:
  
I [Lightburn] am also a member of the group Business  Analytics  on LinkedIn.  I am struck by what I perceive as the gross misuse of statistics by the members of this group, including things that (I thought) were taught in Introductory Statistics courses in business schools.  I want to suggest to you that you look at the discussions there if you want examples of such abuse.


The discussions there support me in my belief that Analytics is data manipulation in the support of previously developed conclusions.
  
My reply:  I don’t think it’s such a bad thing.  I like when people make statistical arguments, even bad statistical arguments.

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>2 0.93216658 <a title="1837-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Bidding_for_the_kickoff.html">559 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Bidding for the kickoff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92352808 <a title="1837-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-NYC_Data_Skeptics_Meetup.html">1837 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-NYC Data Skeptics Meetup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt writes:
  
The hype surrounding Big Data and Data Science is at a fever pitch with promises to solve the worldâ&euro;&trade;s business and social problems, large and small. How accurate or misleading is this message? How is it helping or damaging people, and which people? What opportunities exist for data nerds and entrepreneurs that examine the larger issues with a skeptical view?


 This Meetup  focuses on mathematical, ethical, and business aspects of data from a skeptical perspective. Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling. We will take deep dives into models in the fields of Data Science, statistics, financial engineering, and economics.

No idea if  this  is amusing to non-economists, but I tried my hand at the xtranormal-trend. It’s an attempt to spoof the many standard “incantations” I’ve encountered over the years from economists who don’t want to agree that rational addiction theory lacks justification for some of the claims it makes. More specifically, the claims that the theory can be used to conduct welfare analysis of alternative policies.

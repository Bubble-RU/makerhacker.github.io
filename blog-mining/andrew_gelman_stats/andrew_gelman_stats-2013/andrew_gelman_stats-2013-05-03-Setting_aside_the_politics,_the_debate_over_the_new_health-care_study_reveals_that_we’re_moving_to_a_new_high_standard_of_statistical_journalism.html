<p>Introduction: Despite the title, this post is mostly not about economics or even politics but rather about the central role of  comparisons  in statistics and statistical graphics.
 
It started when someone pointed me to  this article  in which Megan McArdle points out the misleadingness of a graph that seems to show a bimodal income distribution but only by combining cells in the tail:
 
 
 
McArdle makes a good point:  of course, if you spread the histogram along a uniform scale (or, for that matter, a log scale), you don’t see that bump at the high end.  McArdle reproduces some Census charts showing income stability over the past few decades:
 
 
 
Before I had a chance to chance to write about this, I noticed that Mark Palko  did the job  for me.  Palko writes:

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  links  to a  blog  by Megan McArdle which reproduces a list entitled, “What You Paid For:  2009 tax receipt for a taxpayer earning $34,140 and paying $5,400 in federal income tax and FICA (selected items).”
 
McArdle writes, “isn’t it possible that the widespread support for programs like Social Security and Medicare rests on the fact that most people don’t realize just how big a portion of your paycheck those programs consume?”  But, as Palko points out, the FICA and Medicare withholdings are actually already right there on your W-2 form.  So the real problem is not a lack of information but that people aren’t reading their W-2 forms more carefully.  (Also, I don’t know if people are so upset about their withholdings for Social Security and Medicare, given that they’ll be getting that money back when they retire.)
 
I’m more concerned about the list itself, though.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Carroll  shoots down  a politically-loaded claim about cancer survival.  Lots of useful  background  from science reporter Sharon Begley:
  
With the United States spending more on healthcare than any other country — $2.5 trillion, or just over $8,000 per capita, in 2009 — the question has long been, is it worth it? At least for spending on cancer, a controversial new study answers with an emphatic “yes.” . . .


Experts shown an advance copy of the paper by Reuters argued that the tricky statistics of cancer outcomes tripped up the authors.


“This study is pure folly,” said biostatistician Dr. Don Berry of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “It’s completely misguided and it’s dangerous. Not only are the authors’ analyses flawed but their conclusions are also wrong.”
  
Ouch.  Arguably the study shouldn’t be getting any coverage at all, but given that it’s in the news, it’s good to see it get shot down.  I wonder if the  authors  will respond to Don Berry and say they’re sorr</p><p>5 0.12059437 <a title="1838-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-%E2%80%9CThe_difference_between_._._.%E2%80%9D%3A__It%E2%80%99s_not_just_p%3D.05_vs._p%3D.06.html">1072 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-“The difference between . . .”:  It’s not just p=.05 vs. p=.06</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of  this post  by Sanjay Srivastava illustrates an annoying misconception that’s crept into the (otherwise delightful) recent  publicity  related to my  article  with Hal Stern, he difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant.
 
When people bring this up, they keep referring to the difference between p=0.05 and p=0.06, making the familiar (and correct) point about the arbitrariness of the conventional p-value threshold of 0.05.  And, sure, I agree with this, but everybody knows that already.
 
The point Hal and I were making was that even apparently large differences in p-values are not statistically significant. For example, if you have one study with z=2.5 (almost significant at the 1% level!) and another with z=1 (not statistically significant at all, only 1 se from zero!), then their difference has a z of about 1 (again, not statistically significant at all). So it’s not just a comparison of 0.05 vs. 0.06, even a differenc</p><p>6 0.11100685 <a title="1838-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-03-Public_Opinion_on_Health_Care_Reform.html">15 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-03-Public Opinion on Health Care Reform</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thomas Lumley  writes :
  
 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>3 0.85719121 <a title="1838-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-03-On_house_arrest_for_p-hacking.html">2049 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-03-On house arrest for p-hacking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.

<p>Introduction: Reed Abelson and Gardiner Harris  report  in the New York Times that some serious statistical questions have been raised about the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, an influential project that reports huge differences in health care costs and practices in different places in the United States, suggesting large potential cost savings if more efficient practices are used.  (A claim that is certainly plausible to me, given  this notorious graph ; see  here  for background.)
 
Here’s an example of a claim from the  Dartmouth Atlas  (just picking something that happens to be featured on their webpage right now):
  
Medicare beneficiaries who move to some regions receive many more diagnostic tests and new diagnoses than those who move to other regions. This study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, raises important questions about whether being given more diagnoses is beneficial to patients and may help to explain recent controversies about regional differences in spending.

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak points me to  this article  by the always-excellent Carl Bialik, slamming hypothesis tests.  I only wish Carl had talked with me before so hastily posting, though!  I would’ve argued with some of the things in the article.  In particular, he writes:
  
Reese and Brad Carlin . . . suggest that Bayesian statistics are a better alternative, because they tackle the probability that the hypothesis is true head-on, and incorporate prior knowledge about the variables involved.
  
Brad Carlin does great work in theory, methods, and applications, and I like the bit about the prior knowledge (although I might prefer the more general phrase “additional information”), but I hate that quote!  
 
My quick response is that the hypothesis of zero effect is almost never true!  The problem with the significance testing framework–Bayesian or otherwise–is in the obsession with the possibility of an exact zero effect.  The real concern is not with zero, it’s with claiming a positive effect whe</p><p>2 0.98945951 <a title="1838-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-More_by_Berger_and_me_on_weakly_informative_priors.html">1092 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-More by Berger and me on weakly informative priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.
  
I have a few reactions to this:

<p>Introduction: Someone named James writes: 
  
  
I’m working on a classification task, sentence segmentation.  The classifier algorithm we use (BoosTexter, a boosted learning algorithm) classifies each word independently conditional on its features, i.e. a bag-of-words model, so any contextual clues need to be encoded into the features.  The feature extraction system I am proposing in my thesis uses a heteroscedastic LDA to transform data to produce the features the classifier runs on. The HLDA system has a couple parameters I’m testing, and I’m running a 3×2 full factorial experiment. That’s the background which may or may not be relevant to the question.


The output of each trial is a class (there are only 2 classes, right now) for every word in the dataset.  Because of the nature of the task, one class strongly predominates, say 90-95% of the data.  My question is this: in terms of overall performance (we use F1 score), many of these trials are pretty close together, which leads me to ask whethe</p><p>4 0.98787665 <a title="1838-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-12-Fixing_the_race%2C_ethnicity%2C_and_national_origin_questions_on_the_U.S._Census.html">1978 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-12-Fixing the race, ethnicity, and national origin questions on the U.S. Census</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>5 0.98734128 <a title="1838-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-01-Mothers_and_Moms.html">1479 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-01-Mothers and Moms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philip Cohen  asks , “Why are mothers becoming moms?”  These aren’t just two words for the same thing:  in political terms “mother” is merely descriptive while “mom” is more positive.  Indeed, we speak of “mom and apple pie” as unquestionable American icons.
 
Cohen points out that motherhood is sometimes but not always respected in political discourse:
  
On the one hand, both President Obama and pundit Hilary Rosen have now called motherhood the world’s hardest job. And with the Romneys flopping onto the all-mothers-work bandwagon, it appears we’re reaching a rare rhetorical consensus.


On the other hand, the majority in both major political parties agrees that poor single mothers and their children need one thing above all – a (real) job, one that provides the “dignity of an honest day’s work.” For welfare purposes, taking care of children is not only not the toughest job in the world, it is more akin to nothing at all.

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris wrote in with a question:
  
David Hogg points out in one of his general articles on data modeling that regression assumptions require one to put the variable with the highest variance in the ‘y’ position and the variable you know best (lowest variance) in the ‘x’ position.  As he points out, others speak of independent and dependent variables, as if causality determined the form of a regression formula.  In a quick scan of ARM and BDA, I don’t see clear advice, but I do see the use of ‘independent’ and ‘dependent.’


I recently did a model over data in which we know the ‘effect’ pretty well (we measure it), while we know the ’cause’ less well (it’s estimated by people who only need to get it approximately correct).  A model of the form ’cause ~ effect’ fit visually much better than one of the form ‘effect ~ cause’, but interpreting it seems challenging.  


For a simplistic example, let the effect be energy use in a building for cooling (E), and let the cause be outdoor ai</p><p>3 0.088733986 <a title="1680-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-13-Retractions%2C_retractions%3A__%E2%80%9Cleft-wing_enough_to_not_care_about_truth_if_it_confirms_their_social_theories%2C_right-wing_enough_to_not_care_as_long_as_they%E2%80%99re_getting_paid_enough%E2%80%9D.html">1415 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-13-Retractions, retractions:  “left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two news items.
 
1.  A couple people pointed me to the  uncovering  of another fraudulent Dutch psychology researcher—this time it was Dirk Smeesters, rather than  Diederik Stapel .  It’s hard to keep these guys straight—they all pretty much have the same names and do the same things.
 
Stapel and Smeesters also seem to live in the same postmodernist/business-school nexus:  left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough.
 
In the comments to the Retraction Watch post, Richard Gill  writes , “it looks to me [Gill] like Smeesters was subjected to medieval torture and confessed.”  Medieval torture, huh?  I haven’t seen Holy Grail in many years but I recall that’s pretty rough stuff, of the sort that even John Yoo might think twice about.  I followed the links and didn’t see what the torture was, but I have to admit I didn’t even try to read the Dutch documents.

<p>Introduction: David Hogg points me to  this  discussion:
  
Martin Strasbourg and I [Hogg] discussed his project to detect new satellites of M31 in the PAndAS survey. He can construct a likelihood ratio (possibly even a marginalized likelihood ratio) at every position in the M31 imaging, between the best-fit satellite-plus-background model and the best nothing-plus-background model. He can make a two-dimensional map of these likelihood ratios and show a the histogram of them. Looking at this histogram, which has a tail to very large ratios, he asked me, where should I put my cut? That is, at what likelihood ratio does a candidate deserve follow-up? Here’s my unsatisfying answer:


To a statistician, the distribution of likelihood ratios is interesting and valuable to study. To an astronomer, it is uninteresting. You don’t want to know the distribution of likelihoods, you want to find satellites . . .
  
I wrote that I think this makes sense and that it would actualy be an interesting and useful rese</p><p>5 0.078087643 <a title="1680-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-21-Teaching_velocity_and_acceleration.html">1224 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-21-Teaching velocity and acceleration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg  writes  of teaching intro physics:
  
The time derivative of velocity is acceleration, both vectors of course. But I [Hogg] was reminded in office hours today of just how hard it is to get across the idea that the velocity vector and the acceleration vector can point in totally different directions. And some students have trouble seeing this when a ballistic stone is going upwards along some (parabolic) arc, some have trouble seeing it when it is going down, and some have trouble seeing it at the top. That is, different students have very different problems visualizing the differences of the vectors over time.
  
I wonder if it would help to use the business cycle as an example?  When youâ&euro;&trade;re at the top of the cycle, the position is high, the velocity is zero, and the acceleration is negative.  And so on.
 
Would that example work or would it just confuse things further because you still have to make the transition to physical motion (in which the dimensions are positions in</p><p>6 0.0763143 <a title="1680-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties_with_Bayesian_model_averaging.html">754 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties with Bayesian model averaging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  just posted  the discussions of his paper (with Leah Jager), “An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature,” along with some further comments of his own.
 
 Here  are my original thoughts on an earlier version of their article.  Keith O’Rourke and I expanded these thoughts into  a formal comment  for the journal.  We’re pretty much in agreement with John Ioannidis (you can find his discussion in the top link above).
 
In quick summary, I agree with Jager and Leek that this is an important topic.  I think there are two key places where Keith and I disagree with them:
 
1.  They take published p-values at face value whereas we consider them as the result of a complicated process of selection.  This is something I didn’t used to think much about, but now I’ve become increasingly convinced that the problems with published p-values is not a simple file-drawer effect or the case of a few p=0.051 values nudged toward p=0.049, bu</p><p>3 0.80725121 <a title="1680-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-01-%E2%80%9CThough_They_May_Be_Unaware%2C_Newlyweds_Implicitly_Know_Whether_Their_Marriage_Will_Be_Satisfying%E2%80%9D.html">2156 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-01-“Though They May Be Unaware, Newlyweds Implicitly Know Whether Their Marriage Will Be Satisfying”</a></p>

 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>5 0.80324173 <a title="1680-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-07-The_more_likely_it_is_to_be_X%2C_the_more_likely_it_is_to_be_Not_X%3F.html">1158 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-07-The more likely it is to be X, the more likely it is to be Not X?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>6 0.79991043 <a title="1680-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s not just for Chaucer (or Mad Max) anymore.   Peter Frase writes:
  
It’s a shame that we neglect to re-translate older works into English merely because they were originally written in English. Languages change, and our reactions to words and formulations change. This is obvious when you read something like Chaucer, but it’s true to a more subtle degree of more recent writings. There is a pretty good chance that something written in the 19th century won’t mean the same thing to us that it meant to its contemporary readers. Thus it would make sense to re-translate Huckleberry Finn into modern language, in the same way we periodically get new translations of Homer or Dante or Thomas Mann. This is a point that applies equally well to non-fiction and social theory: in some ways, English-speaking sociologists are lucky that our canonical trio of classical theorists-Marx, Weber, and Durkheim-all wrote in another language. The most recent translation of Capital is eminently more readable</p><p>2 0.9083221 <a title="1680-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-08-Angry_about_the_soda_tax.html">191 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-08-Angry about the soda tax</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My Columbia colleague Sheena Iyengar (most famous among ARM readers for her speed-dating experiment) writes an interesting  column  on potential reactions to a tax on sugary drinks.  The idea is that people might be so annoyed at being told what to do that they might buy more of the stuff, at least in the short term.
 
On the other hand, given the famous subsidies involved in the production of high-fructose corn syrup, soda pop is probably a bit cheaper than it should be, so maybe it all balances out?
 
I agree with Sheena that there’s something about loss of control that is particularly frustrating.  One thing that bugs me when I buy a Coke is that I’m paying for the fees of Michael Jordan or whoever it is they have nowadays endorsing their product.  I wish there were some way I could just pay for everything else but withhold the money that’s going into those silly celebrity endorsements.</p><p>3 0.90610135 <a title="1680-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-21-Could_I_use_a_statistics_coach%3F.html">968 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-21-Could I use a statistics coach?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a thought-provoking article subtitled “Top athletes and singers have coaches. Should you?,” surgeon/journalist Atul Gawande  describes  how, even after eight years and more than two thousand operations, he benefited from coaching (from a retired surgeon), just as pro athletes and accomplished musicians do.  He then talks about proposals to institute coaching for teachers to help them perform better.
 
This all makes sense to me—except that I’m a little worried about expansion of the teacher coaching program.  I can imagine it could work pretty well for teachers who are motivated to be coached—for example, I think I would get a lot out of it—but I’m afraid that if teacher coaching became a big business, it would get taken over by McKinsey-style scam artists.
 
But could I use a coach?
 
First, let me get rid of the easy questions.
 
1.  Yes, I could use a squash coach.  I enjoy squash and play when I can, but I’m terrible at it.  I’m sure a coach would help.

<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of reading  this article  by Niall Ferguson summarizing his  notorious  new book.  Here’s the best bit: 
  
  
Far more than in Europe, most Americans remain instinctively loyal to the killer applications of Western ascendancy, from competition all the way through to the work ethic. They know the country has the right software. They just can’t understand why it’s running so damn slowly.


What we need to do is to delete the viruses that have crept into our system: the anticompetitive quasi monopolies that blight everything from banking to public education; the politically correct pseudosciences and soft subjects that deflect good students away from hard science; the lobbyists who subvert the rule of law for the sake of the special interests they represent—to say nothing of our crazily dysfunctional system of health care, our overleveraged personal finances, and our newfound unemployment ethic.

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

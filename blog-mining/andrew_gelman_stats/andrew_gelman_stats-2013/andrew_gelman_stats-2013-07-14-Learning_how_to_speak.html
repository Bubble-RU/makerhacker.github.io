<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.

<p>Introduction: For the past few weeks I’ve been in pain much of the time, some sort of spasms in my neck and shoulder.  Things are mostly better now, but last night I woke up at 5am and my neck was killing me.  On the upside, I’d just been having a dream about multiple imputation and in the dream I had a brilliant idea of how to reconcile conditional and joint model specifications.  Amazingly enough, when I awoke, I remembered the idea from the dream, and, even more amazingly, it really was a good idea.  And, I was in pain and couldn’t fall back asleep.  That was good news because that meant I didn’t forget the idea.  I mentioned it to Jingchen in our midday meeting today and he didn’t shoot it down.
 
At this point, I don’t really know what will happen.  Sometimes I have a sudden inspiration and is works out  just as planned  or even  better than anticipated ; other times, what seems like a brilliant plan goes nowhere.  For this new idea, the next step is the hard work of pushing it through and seei</p><p>3 0.81305218 <a title="1938-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-I_just_skyped_in_from_Kentucky%2C_and_boy_are_my_arms_tired.html">438 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-I just skyped in from Kentucky, and boy are my arms tired</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave my first Skype presentation today, and it felt pretty strange.
 
The technical difficulties mostly arose with the sound.  There were heavy echoes and so we ended up just cutting off the sound from the audience.  This made it more difficult for me because I couldn’t gauge audience reaction.  It was a real challenge to give a talk without being able to hear the laughter of the audience.  (I asked them to wave their hands every time they laughed, but they didn’t do so–or else they were never laughing, which would be even worse.)
 
Next time I’ll use the telephone for at least one of the sound channels.
 
The visuals were ok from my side–I just went thru my slides one by one, using the cursor to point to things.  I prefer standing next to the screen and pointing with my hands.  But doing it this way was ok, considering.
 
The real visual problem went the other way:  I couldn’t really see the audience.  From the perspective of the little computer camera, everyone seemed far away</p><p>4 0.79664886 <a title="1938-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-The_Great_Race.html">1831 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-The Great Race</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Last summer my wife and I took a 3.5-month vacation that included a wide range of activities. When I got back, people would ask “what were the highlights or your trip?”, and I was somewhat at a loss: we had done so many things that were so different, many of which seemed really great…how could I pick? Someone said, wisely, that in six months or a year I’d be able to answer the question because some memories would be more vivid than others. They were right, and I was recently thinking back on our vacation and putting together a list of highlights — enjoyable in itself, but also worth doing to help plan future vacations.
 
One of the things we did was go to four evenings of track and field events at the London Olympics. After we got back, people would ask what we had seen at the Olympics. I would say “We saw Usain Bolt run the 200m, we saw the women’s 4x100m relay and the men’s 4×400, we saw the last events of the decathlon…lots of great stuff. But my favorite was</p><p>5 0.79085654 <a title="1938-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-16-Female_Mass_Murderers%3A__Babes_Behind_Bars.html">36 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-16-Female Mass Murderers:  Babes Behind Bars</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Around the time I was finishing up my Ph.D. thesis, I was trying to come up with a good title–something more grabby than “Topics in Image Reconstruction for Emission Tomography”–and one of the other students said:  How about something iike, Female Mass Murderers:  Babes Behind Bars?  That sounded good to me, and I was all set to use it.  I had a plan:  I’d first submit the one the boring title–that’s how it would be recorded in all the official paperwork–but then at the last minute I’d substitute in the new title page before submitting to the library.  (This was in the days of hard copies.)  Nobody would look at the time, then later on, if anyone went into the library to find my thesis, they’d have a pleasant surprise.  Anyway, as I said, I was all set to do this, but a friend warned me off.  He said that at some point, someone might find it, and the rumor would spread that I’m a sexist pig.  So I didn’t.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>2 0.8274979 <a title="1938-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-To_commenters_who_are_trying_to_sell_something.html">839 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-To commenters who are trying to sell something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone who works in statistics in the pharmaceutical industry (but prefers to remain anonymous) sent me  this update  to our discussion on the differences between approvals of drugs and medical devices:
  
The ‘substantial equivalence’ threshold is a very outdated. Basically the FDA has to follow federal law and the law is antiquated and leads to two extraordinarily different paths for device approval.


You could have a very simple but first-in-kind device with an easy to understand physiological mechanism of action (e.g. the FDA approved a simple tiny stent that would relieve pressure from a glaucoma patient’s eye this summer).  This device would require a standard (likely controlled) trial at the one-sided 0.025 level. Even after the trial it would likely go to a panel where outside experts (e.g.practicing & academic MDs and statisticians) hear evidence from the company and FDA and vote on its safety and efficacy.  FDA would then rule, consider the panel’s vote, on whether to appro</p><p>4 0.70029056 <a title="1938-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-28-What_happened_to_the_world_we_knew%3F.html">2271 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-28-What happened to the world we knew?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was unlocking my bike, with music turned on low, and a couple of high school kids were lounging around nearby.  One of them walked over and asked, « Qui est-ce qui chante? ». I responded, “Stevie Wonder” (not trying any accent on this one).  The kid said, « Ees good ».</p><p>5 0.69623917 <a title="1938-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians%3A_When_We_Teach%2C_We_Don%E2%80%99t_Practice_What_We_Preach.html">1237 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians: When We Teach, We Don’t Practice What We Preach</a></p>

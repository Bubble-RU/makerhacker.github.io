<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>3 0.12352652 <a title="1700-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-06-Picking_on_Stephen_Wolfram.html">1304 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-06-Picking on Stephen Wolfram</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Earlier today I  posted  a weird email that began with “You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years” and continued with a sleazy attempt to squeeze $1000 out of me so that an article that I sent them for free could be available to the public.  $1000 might seem like a lot, but they assured me that “we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate.”  Sort of like a Vegematic but without that set of Ginsu knives thrown in for free.
 
But then when I was responding to comments, I realized that . . . I didn’t actually remember ever publishing anything in that journal.  It’s not on my list of 100+ journals.  I did a search on my published papers page and couldn’t find anything closer than the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health (and that was not within the last few years).  I checked Google Scholar.  And then I went straight to the AJPH webpage and sea</p><p>3 0.66545767 <a title="1700-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-Huh%3F.html">1915 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-Huh?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following bizarre email:
  
Apr 26, 2013


Dear  Andrew Gelman


You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years. Currently, content on the Journal is closed access for the first 2 years after publication, and then freely accessible thereafter.  On June 1, 2013, the Journal will be extending its closed-access window from 2 years to 10 years. Extending this window will close public access to your article via the Journal web portal, but public access will still be available via the National Institutes of Health PubMedCentral web portal. 


If you would like to make your article available to the public for free on the Journal web portal, we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate of  $1,000 per article. If interested in purchasing this access, please contact Brian Selzer, Publications Editor, at brian.selzer@apha.org


Additionally, you may purchas</p><p>4 0.65760571 <a title="1700-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-25-Spam%21.html">2148 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-25-Spam!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one totally faked me out at first.  It was an email from “Nick Bagnall” that began:
  
Dear Dr. Gelman, 


I made contact last year regarding your work in the CMG: Reconstructing Climate from Tree Ring Data project. We are about to start producing the 2014 edition and I wanted to discuss this with you as we still remain keen to feature your work. 


Research Media are producing a special publication in February of 2014, within this report we will be working with a small selected number of PI’s with a focus on geosciences, atmospheric and geospace sciences and earth Sciences.. 
  
At this point, I’m thinking:  Hmmm, I don’t remember this guy, is this some sort of collaborative project that I’d forgotten about?
 
The message then continues:
  
The publication is called International Innovation . . .
  
Huh?  This doesn’t sound so good.  The email then goes on with some very long lists, and then finally the kicker:
  
The total cost for each article produced in this report is fixed a</p><p>5 0.62753284 <a title="1700-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I had a submission a couple years ago that was rejected by a journal.  One of the reviewers began with the following snotty aside:
  
In this manuscript Gelman and Shalizi (there’s no anonymity here; this thing has been floating around the web for some time) . . .
  
Actually, we posted it on the same day we submitted it to the journal.  But double-blindness allowed the reviewer to act as if we had done something wrong!  And, even if it  had  been “floating around the web for some time,” that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Perhaps it just meant that the article had previously been rejected by a bad-attitude reviewer!</p><p>2 0.84246743 <a title="1700-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-03-This_is_a_footnote_in_one_of_my_papers.html">448 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-03-This is a footnote in one of my papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the annals of hack literature, it is sometimes said that if you aim to write best-selling crap, all you’ll end up with is crap.  To truly produce best-selling crap, you have to have a conviction, perhaps misplaced, that your writing has integrity.  Whether or not this is a good generalization about writing, I have seen an analogous phenomenon in statistics:  If you try to do nothing but model the data, you can be in for a wild and unpleasant ride:  real data always seem to have one more twist beyond our ability to model (von Neumann’s elephant’s trunk notwithstanding).  But if you model the underlying process, sometimes your model can fit surprisingly well as well as inviting openings for future research progress.</p><p>3 0.81617671 <a title="1700-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-16-BDA_at_40%25_off%21.html">1984 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-16-BDA at 40% off!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Roy Mendelssohn pointed me to  this  heartwarming story of Jay Vadiveloo, an actuary who got a patent for the idea of statistical sampling.  Vadiveloo writes, “the results were astounding: statistical sampling worked.”
 
You may laugh, but wait till Albedo Man buys the patent and makes everybody do his bidding.  They’re gonna dig up Laplace and make him pay retroactive royalties.  And somehow Clippy will get involved in all this.
 
P.S.  Mendelssohn writes:  “Yes, I felt it was a heartwarming story also.  Perhaps we can get a patent for regression.”
 
I say, forget a patent for regression.  I want a patent for the sample mean.  That’s where the real money is.  You can’t charge a lot for each use, but consider the volume!</p><p>5 0.80307221 <a title="1700-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably_common_misunderstanding_of_meritocracy.html">1037 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably common misunderstanding of meritocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.  Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous”</p><p>6 0.77196282 <a title="1700-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-Drug_testing_for_recipents_of_NSF_and_NIH_grants%3F.html">92 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-Drug testing for recipents of NSF and NIH grants?</a></p>

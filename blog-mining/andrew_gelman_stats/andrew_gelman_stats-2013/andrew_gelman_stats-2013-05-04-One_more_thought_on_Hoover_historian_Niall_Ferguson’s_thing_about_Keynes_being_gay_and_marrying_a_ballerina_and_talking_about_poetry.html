[sent-6, score-0.108]
</p><p>2 My disagreements with Keynes’s economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation. [sent-11, score-0.158]
</p><p>3 It is simply false to suggest, as I did, that his approach to economic policy was inspired by any aspect of his personal life. [sent-12, score-0.185]
</p><p>4 After all, it’s not unreasonable to think that someone’s personal circumstances will affect their political attitudes and their views on economic policy. [sent-15, score-0.435]
</p><p>5 And certainly no one doubts that Keynes’s background as an upper-class British backgrounds was relevant for understanding his views. [sent-16, score-0.047]
</p><p>6 I think the problem was that Ferguson did not seem to be engaging with an open mind but rather seemed to be just trying to throw mud at Keynes as if he (Ferguson) were operating a political campaign rather than engaging in academic inquiry. [sent-18, score-0.572]
</p><p>7 If Ferguson were to give a talk all about the connections between the personal circumstances and political beliefs of historical economists, I don’t think people would have a problem with it. [sent-19, score-0.266]
</p><p>8 Ferguson is a historian (or, as I assume he would say, an historian), and he’d be highly qualified to do that sort of thing. [sent-21, score-0.123]
</p><p>9 But to just throw culture-war words at his audience in an attempt to vaguely disparage Keynes, that’s just stupid. [sent-22, score-0.151]
</p><p>10 Again, nobody’s perfect, and Ferguson himself recognized the stupidity of his remarks. [sent-23, score-0.131]
</p><p>11 I don’t think this will, or should, deter historians from connecting the lives and ideas of famous thinkers. [sent-24, score-0.16]
</p><p>12 But it doesn’t look like that’s what was being done here; rather, Ferguson was doin some insinsuatin as a way to discredit a political opponent, which works better on the campaign trail than when coming from a scholar. [sent-25, score-0.232]
</p><p>13 Regarding Ferguson himself, I hold with my  view  from last year that he is the victim of the paradox of influence:    No, I think what Ferguson is looking for (as am I, in my scholarly domain) is influence. [sent-26, score-0.205]
</p><p>14 And one thing about being paid $50K for a lecture is that you can assume that whoever is paying you really wants to hear what you have to say. [sent-28, score-0.088]
</p><p>15 The paradox, though, is that Ferguson gets and keeps the big-money audience is by telling them not what he (Ferguson) wants to say—not by giving them his unique insights and understanding—but rather by telling his audience what they want to hear. [sent-29, score-0.437]
</p><p>16 The paradox is that the anticipated influence becomes valueless if you end up saying whatever it takes to keep it. [sent-33, score-0.163]
</p><p>17 In this case, I think Ferguson went too far when he threw in some crowd-pleasing anti-Keynes remarks that didn’t please his crowd so much. [sent-34, score-0.317]
</p><p>18 The Kenyes-is-a-poof remarks would’ve been unremarkable had they been made by a comedian or a politician or talk-show host. [sent-37, score-0.283]
</p><p>19 A historian can and should do better, and Ferguson himself recognized this by characterizing his remarks as “stupid. [sent-38, score-0.365]

<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

<p>Introduction: Ashok Rao  shreds  the latest book from Niall Ferguson, who we’ve  encountered  most recently as the source of homophobic slurs but who used to be a  serious scholar . Or maybe still is. Remember Linda, that character from the Kahneman and Tversky vignette who was deemed likely to be “a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement”? Maybe Ferguson is a serious scholar who is active in the being-a-hack movement. Perhaps when he’s  not  writing books where he distorts his sources, or giving lectures with unfortunate slurs, he’s doing historical research. It’s certainly possible.
 
Rao describes how Ferguson distorts his source materials.  This is a no-no for any historian, of course, but not such a surprise for Ferguson, who crossed over the  John Yoo line  awhile ago.

And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site.

<p>Introduction: I don’t want this to be a regular feature but I wanted to briefly comment on Ferguson’s  open letter  regarding the Keynes-was-a-ballet-and-poetry-loving-poof remarks he made the other day at that conference of financial advisors.  (I’m posting this one at night, and a new post on an unrelated topic is coming in the morning, so I’m burying it as much as possible.)
 
Ferguson reiterates that his remarks were “stupid.”  The question then arises:  He’s a smart guy, how did he end up saying such stupid things?  Ferguson has a history of saying high-profile stupid things, and they always seem to be when he’s trying to make some sort of political point.
 
I’m still going with  my theory  that Ferguson misjudged his audience; he thought they’d appreciate an anti-Keynes remark, maybe he even thought they were the kind of crowd that would enjoy cracks about gay people who like ballet and poetry. No go.
 
Again, I’m not trying to nail the guy to the cross for this.

Or maybe still is. Remember Linda, that character from the Kahneman and Tversky vignette who was deemed likely to be “a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement”? Maybe Ferguson is a serious scholar who is active in the being-a-hack movement. Perhaps when he’s  not  writing books where he distorts his sources, or giving lectures with unfortunate slurs, he’s doing historical research. It’s certainly possible.
 
Rao describes how Ferguson distorts his source materials.  This is a no-no for any historian, of course, but not such a surprise for Ferguson, who crossed over the  John Yoo line  awhile ago.
 
Last year I wrote about the paradox of influence:  Ferguson gets and keeps the big-money audience by telling them not what he (Ferguson) wants to say—not by giving them his unique insights and understanding—but rat</p><p>5 0.91968238 <a title="1840-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-29-World_Class_Speakers_and_Entertainers.html">1034 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-29-World Class Speakers and Entertainers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  our discussion  of historian Niall Ferguson and piss-poor monocausal social science, commenter Matt W. pointed to Ferguson’s listing at a speakers bureau.  One of his talks is entitled “Is This the Chinese Century?”  The question mark at the end seems to give him some wiggle room.
 
I give some paid lectures myself and was curious to learn more about this organization, World Class Speakers and Entertainers, so I clicked through to  this list of topics  and then searched for Statistics.  Amazingly enough, there was a “Statistician” category (right above “Story Teller / Lore / Art / Power of Story Telling,” “Strategist / Strategies / Strategic Planning,” and “Success”).
 
There I found  Gopal C. Dorai, Ph.D. , who offers insights such as “vegetarians usually will not eat meat products, no matter how hungry they feel.”  And “Cheating or lying for the sake of obtaining favorable treatment from others will be anathema to some people.”  And “Life is a one-way-street; we cannot turn the c</p><p>6 0.90236658 <a title="1840-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-07-Like_Casper_the_ghost%2C_Niall_Ferguson_is_not_only_white.__He_is_also_very%2C_very_adorable..html">1846 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-07-Like Casper the ghost, Niall Ferguson is not only white.

<p>Introduction: We had some interesting comments on our recent  reflections  on Niall Ferguson’s ill-chosen remarks in which he attributed Keynes’s economic views (I don’t actually know exactly what Keyesianism is, but I think a key part is for the government to run surpluses during economic booms and deficits during recessions) to the Keynes being gay and marrying a ballerina and talking about poetry.  The general idea, I think, is that people without kids don’t care so much about the future, and this motivated Keynes’s party-all-the-time attitude, which might have worked just fine for Eddie Murphy’s girlfriend in the 1980s and in San Francisco bathhouses of the 1970s but, according to Ferguson, is not the ticket for preserving today’s American empire.
 
Some of the more robust defenders of Ferguson may have been disappointed by his followup remarks:  “I should not have suggested . . . that Keynes was indifferent to the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children because he was g</p><p>2 0.94176304 <a title="1840-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-04-Jesus_historian_Niall_Ferguson_and_the_improving_standards_of_public_discourse.html">1839 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-04-Jesus historian Niall Ferguson and the improving standards of public discourse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>4 0.9133991 <a title="1840-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-26-Ethnicity_and_Population_Structure_in_Personal_Naming_Networks.html">925 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-26-Ethnicity and Population Structure in Personal Naming Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks pointed me to  this recent article  by Pablo Mateos, Paul Longley, and David O’Sullivan on one of my favorite topics.
 
The authors produced a potentially cool  naming network of the city of Auckland New Zealand .  I say “potentially cool” because I have such difficulty reading the article–I speak English, statistics, and a bit of political science and economics, but this one is written in heavy sociologese–that I can’t quite be sure what they’re doing.  However, despite my (perhaps unfair) disdain for the particulars of their method, it’s probably good that they’re jumping in with this analysis.  Others can take their data (and similar datasets from elsewhere) and do better.  Ya gotta start somewhere, and the basic idea (to cluster first names that are associated with the same last names, and to cluster last names that are associated with the same first names) seems good.

<p>Introduction: I received the following in email from our publisher:
  
I write with regards to the project to publish a China Edition of your book “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” (ISBN-13: 9780521686891) for the mainland Chinese market. I regret to inform you that we have been notified by our partner in China, Posts & Telecommunications Press (PTP), that due to various politically sensitive materials in the text, the China Edition has not met with the approval of the publishing authorities in China, and as such PTP will not be able to proceed with the publication of this edition. We will therefore have to cancel plans for the China Edition of your book. Please accept my apologies for this unforeseen development. If you have any queries regarding this, do feel free to let me know.

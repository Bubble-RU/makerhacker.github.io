(actually, in 5 minutes)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?  Thanks.</p><p>3 0.15546 <a title="2028-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-14-BDA_class_G%2B_hangout_another_try.html">2100 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-14-BDA class G+ hangout another try</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30 (Paris time) I will be teaching my Bayesian Data Analysis  class  (class4a.pdf and class4b.pdf, you can follow the slides  here ).
 
We had  problems  earlier with the regular G+ hangout, so this time we’re trying the G+ On-Air Hangout which I think should work better.
 
I’ll post a blog entry tomorrow with a link to the hangout.  Let’s hope for the best!</p><p>4 0.13886696 <a title="2028-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-16-Uri_Simonsohn_is_speaking_at_Columbia_tomorrow_%28Mon%29.html">1499 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-16-Uri Simonsohn is speaking at Columbia tomorrow (Mon)</a></p>

Participants will build the communication skills that technical professionals need to express complex ideas to their peers, experts in other fields, and the general public.  There will be panel discussions on the following topics:


* Engaging Non-Scientific Audiences 
* Science Writing for a Cause 
* Communicating Science Through Fiction 
* Sharing Science with Scientists 
* The World of Non-Academic Publishing 
* Communicating using Multimedia and the Web

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: Inspired by the Future of Statistical Sciences Workshop (an official event which will be full of middle-aged guys talking about the future), Jeff Leek and Roger Peng have organized a  mini-conference in the form of a Google hangout  featuring a bunch of youngsters.  Seems like a good idea to me!  Their particular focus will be on “education, new methods, software development, collaborations with natural sciences/social sciences, and the relationship between statistics and industry.”  Their “unconference” will be noon on 30 Oct; you can follow the link to get the details.</p><p>2 0.90976167 <a title="2028-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-13-Stan%21.html">1855 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-13-Stan!</a></p>

I thought you’d all like to know that Stan was used and referenced in a peer-reviewed Rapid Communications  paper  on influenza.  Thank you for this excellent modelling language and sampler, which made it possible to carry out this work quickly!
  
I haven’t actually read the paper, but I’m happy to see Stan getting around like that.</p><p>3 0.89600825 <a title="2028-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-09-Solve_mazes_by_starting_at_the_exit.html">459 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-09-Solve mazes by starting at the exit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It worked on  this one .
 
Good maze designers know this trick and are careful to design multiple branches in each direction. Back when I was in junior high, I used to make huge mazes, and the basic idea was to anticipate what the solver might try to do and to make the maze difficult by postponing the point at which he would realize a path was going nowhere.  For example, you might have 6 branches:  one dead end, two pairs that form loops going back to the start, and one that is the correct solution.  You do this from both directions and add some twists and turns, and there you are.
 
But the maze designer aiming for the naive solver–the sap who starts from the entrance and goes toward the exit–can simplify matters by just having 6 branches:  five dead ends and one winner.  This sort of thing is easy to solve in the reverse direction.  I’m surprised the Times didn’t do better for their special puzzle issue.</p><p>4 0.87934089 <a title="2028-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-31-He%E2%80%99s_getting_ready_to_write_a_book.html">1783 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-31-He’s getting ready to write a book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Novik does some open-source  planning :
  
My co-author, Jacki Buros, and I [Novik] have just signed a contract with Apress to write a book tentatively entitled “Predictive Analytics with R”, which will cover programming best practices, data munging, data exploration, and single and multi-level models with case studies in social media, healthcare, politics, marketing, and the stock market.


Why does the world need another R book?  We think there is a shortage of books that deal with the complete and programmer centric analysis of real, dirty, and sometimes unstructured data.  Our target audience are people who have some familiarity with statistics, but do not have much experience with programming. . . .


The book is projected to be about 300 pages across 8 chapters. This is my first experience with writing a book and everything I heard about the process tells me that this is going to be a long and arduous endeavor lasting anywhere from 6 to 8 months.
  
Novik emailed me and wrot</p><p>5 0.86929572 <a title="2028-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-10-He_said_he_was_sorry.html">1756 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-10-He said he was sorry</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yes, it can be  done :
  
Hereby I contact you to clarify the situation that occurred with the publication of the article entitled *** which was published in Volume 11, Issue 3 of *** and I made the mistake of declaring as an author.  This chapter is a plagiarism of . . .


I wish to express and acknowledge that I am solely responsible for this . . . I recognize the gravity of the offense committed, since there is no justification for so doing. Therefore, and as a sign of shame and regret I feel in this situation, I will publish this letter, in order to set an example for other researchers do not engage in a similar error.


No more, and to please accept my apologies,


Sincerely,

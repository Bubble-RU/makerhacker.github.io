There are several issues with the use of ecological correlations: They tend to be a lot higher than individual-level correlations, and assuming what is seen at the group level also holds at the level of the individual is so pernicious, it has been labeled the “ecological fallacy” by Selvin (1958). The term ecological correlation was popularized from a 1950 article by William Robinson (Robinson, 1950), but the idea has been around for some time (e.g., see the 1939 article by E. L. Thorndike, On the Fallacy of Imputing Correlations Found for Groups to the Individuals or Smaller Groups Composing Them).</p><p>3 0.11128098 <a title="1704-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-04-What_are_the_key_assumptions_of_linear_regression%3F.html">1967 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-04-What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a></p>

A link to an  article , “Four Assumptions Of Multiple Regression That Researchers Should Always Test”, has been making  the rounds  on Twitter.  Their first rule is “Variables are Normally distributed.”  And they seem to be talking about the independent variables – but then later bring in tests on the residuals (while admitting that the normally-distributed error assumption is a weak assumption).  


I thought we had long-since moved away from transforming our independent variables to make them normally distributed for statistical reasons (as opposed to standardizing them for interpretability, etc.)  Am I missing something?  I agree that leverage in a influence is important, but normality of the variables? The article is from 2002, so it might be dated, but given the popularity of the tweet, I thought I’d ask your opinion.

I saw  a post  on Andrew Sullivan’s blog today about life expectancy in different US counties. With a bunch of the worst counties being in Mississippi, I thought that it might be another case of analysts getting extreme values from small counties.


However, the paper (see  here ) includes a pretty interesting methods section. This is from page 5, “Specifically, we used a mixed-effects Poisson regression with time, geospatial, and covariate components. Poisson regression fits count outcome variables, e.g., death counts, and is preferable to a logistic model because the latter is biased when an outcome is rare (occurring in less than 1% of observations).”


They have downloadable data. I believe that the data are predicted values from the model. A web appendix also gives 90% CIs for their estimates.


Do you think they solved the small county problem and that the worst counties really are where their spreadsheet suggests?

While reading your  postings  [or  here ] on the subject of testing your model by running fake data I was reminded of the fact that I got one of these kinds of tests actually published in a GAO report back in the day.  Reading your posts on Unz and  political vs. economic discourse  made me think of that work again.  I thought I’d actually drop you a line on the subject.


Back in 2003 GAO was asked to look at Farmer Mac, including a look at the Farm Credit Agency’s regulation of Farmer Mac.  As the resident mortgage econometrician back then I was asked to look at FCA’s risk based capital stress test for Farmer Mac.  The work was pretty easy.  I found a lot of oddities, but the biggest one was that they were using a discrete choice set up (loan goes bad or doesn’t) instead of a hazard model (loan goes bad this period or survives to the next).  Not necessarily a problem – lots of mortgage models run that way.

I [Mulford] ran across  this blog post  and found myself questioning the relevance of the test used.


I’d think Chi-Square would be inappropriate for trying to measure significance of choice in the manner presented here; irrespective of the cute hamster.  Since this is a common test for marketers and website developers – I’d be interested in which techniques you might suggest?


For tests of this nature, I typically measure a variety of variables (image placement, size, type, page speed, “page feel” as expressed in a factor, etc) and use LOGIT, Cluster and possibly a simple Bayesian model to determine which variables were most significant (chosen). Pearson Chi-squared may be used to express relationships between variables and outcome but I’ve typically not used it to simply judge a 0/1 choice as statistically significant or not.

I’m a physicist by training who is transitioning to the social sciences. I recently came across a  reference  in the Economist to a paper on IQ and parasites which I read as I have more than a passing interest in IQ research (having read much that you and others (e.g., Shalizi, Wicherts) have written). In this paper I note that the authors find a very high correlation between national IQ and parasite prevalence. The strength of the correlation (-0.76 to -0.82) surprised me, as I’m used to much weaker correlations in the social sciences. To me, it’s a bit too high, suggesting that there are other factors at play or that one of the variables is merely a proxy for a large number of other variables. But I have no basis for this other than a gut feeling and a memory of a plot on  Language Log  about the distribution of correlation coefficients in social psychology.


So my question is this: Is a correlation in the range of (-0.82,-0.76) more likely to be a correlatio</p><p>6 0.7291587 <a title="1704-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-04-What_are_the_key_assumptions_of_linear_regression%3F.html">1967 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-04-What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Commenters here are occasionally bothered that I spend so much time attacking frauds and plagiarists.  See, for example,  here  and  here .  Why go on and on about these losers, given that there are more important problems in the world such as war, pestilence, hunger, and graphs where the y-axis doesn’t go all the way down to zero?
 
Part of the story is that I do research for a living so I resent people who devalue research through misattribution or fraud, in the same way that rich people don’t like counterfeiters.
 
What really bugs me, though, is when cheaters get caught and still don’t admit it.  People like Hauser, Wegman, Fischer, and Weick get under my skin because they have the chutzpah to just deny deny deny.  The grainy time-stamped videotape with their hand in the cookie jar is right there, and they’ll still talk around the problem.  Makes me want to scream.
 
This happens  all the time .  All. Over. The. Place.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll points to  this  ten-year-old article from Anne-Wil Harzing on the consequences of sloppy citations.  Harzing tells the story of an unsupported claim that is contradicted by published data but has been presented as fact in a particular area of the academic literature.  She writes that “high expatriate failure rates [with "expatriate failure" defined as "the expatriate returning home before his/her contractual period of employment abroad expires"] were in fact a myth created by massive misquotations and careless copying of references.”  Many papers claimed an expatriate failure rate of 25-40% (according to Harzing, this is much higher than the actual rate as estimated from empirical data), with this overly-high rate supported by a complicated link of references leading to . . . no real data.
 
Hartzing reports the following published claims:

<p>Introduction: I was curious  so I ordered a used copy.  It was pretty good.  It fit in my pocket and I read it on the plane.  It was written in a bland, spare manner, not worth reading for any direct insights it would give into human nature, but the plot moved along.  And the  background material  was interesting in the window it gave into the society of the 1950s.  It was fun to read a book of pulp fiction that didnâ&euro;&trade;t have any dead bodies in it.
 
I wonder what Jenny Davidson would think of it.</p><p>4 0.94943535 <a title="1704-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-13-Macro%2C_micro%2C_and_conflicts_of_interest.html">1456 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-13-Macro, micro, and conflicts of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  and  this .  There seems to be a perception that “economists, the people who will cooly explain why people will be completely corrupt if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, see themselves as being completely not corrupt” (according to Atrios) and that “the economists who have decided to lend their names to the [Romney] campaign have been caught up in this culture of fraud” (according to Krugman).
 
The bloggers above are talking about macro, and perhaps they’re right that macroeconomists see themselves as uncorruptible and above it all.  As with political science, the key parts of macroeconomics are about what is good for the world (or, at least, what is good for the country), and it’s hard to do this well from a level of complete cynicism.  I’m no expert on macroeconomics, but my general impression is that, Marxists aside, macroeconomists tend to assume shared goals.
 
Micro, though, that’s completely different.  These dudes are happy to admit to t</p><p>5 0.94708133 <a title="1704-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-26-NYC.html">926 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-26-NYC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our downstairs neighbor hates us.  She looks away from us when we see them on the street, if we’re coming into the building at the same time she doesn’t hold open the door, and if we’re in the elevator when it stops on her floor, she refuses to get on.
 
On the other hand, if you’re a sociology professor in Chicago, one of your colleagues might try to run you over in a parking lot.  So I guess I’m getting off easy.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.94657737 <a title="1704-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-03-Heuristics_for_identifying_ecological_fallacies%3F.html">1704 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-03-Heuristics for identifying ecological fallacies?</a></p>

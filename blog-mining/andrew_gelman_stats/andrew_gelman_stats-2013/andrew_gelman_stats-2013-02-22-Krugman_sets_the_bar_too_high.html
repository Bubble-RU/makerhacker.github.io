<p>Introduction: David Hogg  writes  of teaching intro physics:
  
The time derivative of velocity is acceleration, both vectors of course. But I [Hogg] was reminded in office hours today of just how hard it is to get across the idea that the velocity vector and the acceleration vector can point in totally different directions. And some students have trouble seeing this when a ballistic stone is going upwards along some (parabolic) arc, some have trouble seeing it when it is going down, and some have trouble seeing it at the top. That is, different students have very different problems visualizing the differences of the vectors over time.
  
I wonder if it would help to use the business cycle as an example?  When youâ&euro;&trade;re at the top of the cycle, the position is high, the velocity is zero, and the acceleration is negative.  And so on.
 
Would that example work or would it just confuse things further because you still have to make the transition to physical motion (in which the dimensions are positions in</p><p>3 0.16138528 <a title="1733-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-04-The_Folk_Theorem_of_Statistical_Computing.html">1841 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-04-The Folk Theorem of Statistical Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From an email I received the other day:
  
Things are going much better now — it’s interesting, it feels like with both of my models, parameters are slow to converge or get “stuck” and have trouble mixing when the model is somehow misspecified.

<p>Introduction: I had a brief email exchange with Jeff Leek regarding our recent  discussions  of replication, criticism, and the self-correcting process of science.
 
Jeff writes:
  
(1) I can see the problem with serious, evidence-based criticisms not being published in the same journal (and linked to) studies that are shown to be incorrect. I have been mostly seeing these sorts of things show up in blogs. But I’m not sure that is a bad thing. I think people read blogs more than they read the literature. I wonder if this means that blogs will eventually be a sort of “shadow literature”? 


(2) I think there is a ton of bad literature out there, just like there is a ton of bad stuff on Google. If we focus too much on the bad stuff we will be paralyzed. I still manage to find good papers despite all the bad papers. 


(3) I think one positive solution to this problem is to incentivize/publish referee reports and give people credit for a good referee report just like they get credit for a good paper.

<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>6 0.14141864 <a title="1733-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-27-Another_silly_graph.html">733 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-27-Another silly graph</a></p>

<p>Introduction: More and more I feel like economics reporting is based on crude principles of adding up “good news” and “bad news.”  Sometimes this makes sense:  by almost any measure, an unemployment rate of 10% is bad news compared to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Other times, though, the good/bad news framework seems so tangled.
 
For example:  house prices up is considered good news but inflation is considered bad news.  A strong dollar is considered good news but it’s also an unfavorable exchange rate, which is bad news.  When facebook shares go down, that’s bad news, but if they automatically go up, that means they were underpriced which doesn’t seem so good either.  Pundits are torn between rooting for the euro to fail (which means our team (the U.S.) is better than Europe (their team)) and rooting for it to survive (because a collapse in Europe is bad news for the U.S. economy).  China’s economy doing well is bad news—but if their economy slips, that’s bad news too.  I think you get the picture</p><p>3 0.62639815 <a title="1733-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-02-Another_retraction.html">1359 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-02-Another retraction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>5 0.60007817 <a title="1733-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-28-Nostalgia.html">1874 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-28-Nostalgia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Saw Argo the other day, was impressed by the way it was filmed in such a 70s style, sorta like that movie The Limey or an episode of the Rockford Files.
 
I also felt nostalgia for that relatively nonviolent era.  All those hostages and nobody was killed.  It’s a good thing the Ayatollah didn’t have some fundamentalist Shiite equivalent of John Yoo telling him to waterboard everybody.
 
At the time we were all so angry and upset about the hostage-taking, but from the perspective of our suicide-bomber era, that whole hostage episode seems so comfortingly mild.</p><p>6 0.59773642 <a title="1733-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Life_in_New_York%2C_Then_and_Now.html">139 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Life in New York, Then and Now</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Hogg  writes  of teaching intro physics:
  
The time derivative of velocity is acceleration, both vectors of course. But I [Hogg] was reminded in office hours today of just how hard it is to get across the idea that the velocity vector and the acceleration vector can point in totally different directions. And some students have trouble seeing this when a ballistic stone is going upwards along some (parabolic) arc, some have trouble seeing it when it is going down, and some have trouble seeing it at the top. That is, different students have very different problems visualizing the differences of the vectors over time.
  
I wonder if it would help to use the business cycle as an example?  When youâ&euro;&trade;re at the top of the cycle, the position is high, the velocity is zero, and the acceleration is negative.  And so on.
 
Would that example work or would it just confuse things further because you still have to make the transition to physical motion (in which the dimensions are positions in</p><p>2 0.99718821 <a title="1733-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-14-%E2%80%9CLike_a_group_of_teenagers_on_a_bus%2C_they_behave_in_public_as_if_they_were_in_private%E2%80%9D.html">414 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-14-“Like a group of teenagers on a bus, they behave in public as if they were in private”</a></p>

I had a question about BMA [Bayesian model averaging] and model combinations in general, and direct it to you since they are a basic form of hierarchical model, albeit in the simplest of forms. I wanted to ask what the underlying assumptions are that could lead to BMA improving on a larger model. 


I know model combination is a topic of interest in the (frequentist) econometrics community (e.g., Bates & Granger, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3008764?uid=3738032&uid;=2&uid;=4&sid;=21101948653381) but at the time it was considered a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps small models combined outperform a big model due to standard errors, insufficient data, etc. But I haven’t seen much in way of Bayesian justification.


In simplest terms, you might have a joint density P(Y,theta_1,theta_2) from which you could use the two marginals P(Y,theta_1) and P(Y,theta_2) to derive two separate forecasts. A BMA-er would do a weighted average of the two forecast densities, having p</p><p>4 0.99677187 <a title="1733-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-09-%E2%80%9CHeterogeneity_of_variance_in_experimental_studies%3A__A_challenge_to_conventional_interpretations%E2%80%9D.html">1891 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-09-“Heterogeneity of variance in experimental studies:  A challenge to conventional interpretations”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Avi sent along  this old paper  from Bryk and Raudenbush, who write:
  
The presence of heterogeneity of variance across groups indicates that the standard statistical model for treatment effects no longer applies. Specifically, the assumption that treatments add a constant to each subject’s development fails. An alternative model is required to represent how treatment effects are distributed across individuals. We develop in this article a simple statistical model to demonstrate the link between heterogeneity of variance and random treatment effects. Next, we illustrate with results from two previously published studies how a failure to recognize the substantive importance of heterogeneity of variance obscured significant results present in these data. The article concludes with a review and synthesis of techniques for modeling variances. Although these methods have been well established in the statistical literature, they are not widely known by social and behavioral scientists.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there.  As I  wrote  a couple years ago, it’s usually presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
For example, Nassim Taleb has a  webpage  that includes a bunch of one-line bits of advice (scroll to item 132 on the linked page).  Here’s his final piece of advice:
  
If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.
  
I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.  I’ve been in environments where people follow Taleb’s advice, saying nothing and occasionally trying to “eliminate” people, and it’s not pretty.  I much prefer for people to be open</p><p>6 0.99264669 <a title="1733-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-03-An_argument_that_can%E2%80%99t_possibly_make_sense.html">743 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-03-An argument that can’t possibly make sense</a></p>

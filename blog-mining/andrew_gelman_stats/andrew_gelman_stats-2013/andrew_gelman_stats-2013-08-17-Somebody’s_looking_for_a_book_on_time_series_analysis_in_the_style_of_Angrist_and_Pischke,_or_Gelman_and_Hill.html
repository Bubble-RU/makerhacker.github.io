<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes with two interesting questions involving time series analysis:
  
 
I used to work in an organization that designed and made signal processing equipment.  Antialiasing and windowing of time series was a big deal in performing analysis accurately.  


Now I’m in a place where I have to make inferences about human-scaled time series.  It has dawned on me that the two are related.  I’m not sure we often have data sampled at a rate at least twice the highest frequency present (not just the highest frequency of interest).  The only articles I’ve seen about aliasing as applied to social science series are from  Hinich  or from  related works .  Box and Jenkins hint at it in section 13.3 of Time Series Analysis, but the analysis seems to be mostly heuristic.  Yet I can imagine all sorts of time series subject to similar problems, from analyses of stock prices based on closing prices (mentioned in the latter article) to other economic series measured on a monthly basis to en</p><p>3 0.22780952 <a title="1986-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-28-Reference_on_longitudinal_models%3F.html">1188 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-28-Reference on longitudinal models?</a></p>

The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  posted  a review of a submitted manuscript where I first wrote that I read the paper only shallowly and then followed up with some suggestions on the statistical analysis, recommending that overdispersion be added to a fitted Posson regression and that the table of regression results be supplemented with a graph showing data and fitted lines.
 
A commenter asked why I wrote such an apparently shallow review, and I realized that some of the implications of my review were not as clear as I’d thought.  So let me clarify.
 
There is a connection between my general reaction and my statistical comments.  My statistical advice here is relevant for (at least) two reasons.  First, a Poisson regression without overdispersion will give nearly-uninterpretable standard errors, which means that I have no sense if the results are statistically significant as claimed.  Second, with a time series plot and regression table, but no graph showing the estimated treatment effect, it is very dif</p><p>6 0.12809525 <a title="1986-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-09-The_first_version_of_my_%E2%80%9Cinference_from_iterative_simulation_using_parallel_sequences%E2%80%9D_paper%21.html">1309 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-09-The first version of my “inference from iterative simulation using parallel sequences” paper!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Eric Novik does some open-source  planning :
  
My co-author, Jacki Buros, and I [Novik] have just signed a contract with Apress to write a book tentatively entitled “Predictive Analytics with R”, which will cover programming best practices, data munging, data exploration, and single and multi-level models with case studies in social media, healthcare, politics, marketing, and the stock market.


Why does the world need another R book?  We think there is a shortage of books that deal with the complete and programmer centric analysis of real, dirty, and sometimes unstructured data.  Our target audience are people who have some familiarity with statistics, but do not have much experience with programming. . . .


The book is projected to be about 300 pages across 8 chapters. This is my first experience with writing a book and everything I heard about the process tells me that this is going to be a long and arduous endeavor lasting anywhere from 6 to 8 months.
  
Novik emailed me and wrot</p><p>3 0.69661629 <a title="1986-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-20-A_statistical_model_for_underdispersion.html">1542 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-20-A statistical model for underdispersion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have lots of models for overdispersed count data but we rarely see underdispersed data.  But now I know what example I’ll be giving when this next comes up in class.  From a  book review  by Theo Tait:
  
A number of shark species go in for oophagy, or uterine cannibalism. Sand tiger foetuses ‘eat each other in utero, acting out the harshest form of sibling rivalry imaginable’. Only two babies emerge, one from each of the mother shark’s uteruses: the survivors have eaten everything else. ‘A female sand tiger gives birth to a baby that’s already a metre long and an experienced killer,’ explains Demian Chapman, an expert on the subject.
  
That’s what I call underdispersion.  E(y)=2, var(y)=0.  Take that, M. Poisson!</p><p>4 0.67278731 <a title="1986-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-09-Both_R_and_Stata.html">76 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-09-Both R and Stata</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student I’m working with writes:
  
I was planning on getting a applied stat text as a desk reference, and for that I’m assuming you’d recommend your own book. Also, being an economics student, I was initially planning on doing my analysis in STATA, but I noticed on your blog that you use R, and apparently so does the rest of the statistics profession. Would you rather I do my programming in R this summer, or does it not matter? It doesn’t look too hard to learn, so just let me know what’s most convenient for you.
  
My reply:  Yes, I recommend my book with Jennifer Hill.  Also the book by John Fox, An R and S-plus Companion to Applied Regression, is a good way to get into R.  I recommend you use both Stata and R.  If you’re already familiar with Stata, then stick with it–it’s a great system for working with big datasets.  You can grab your data in Stata, do some basic manipulations, then save a smaller dataset to read into R (using R’s read.dta() function).

I’ve been reading your Regression and Multilevel Modeling book. Do you have a set of example solutions for the problems in the book?
  
Henning Piezunka, Adam Lynton, and others have asked the same question.

<p>Introduction: The National Climatic Data Center has  tentatively announced  that 2010 is, get this, “tied” for warmest on record.  Presumably they mean it’s tied to the precision that they quote (1.12 F above the 20th-century average). The uncertainty in the measurements, as well as some fuzziness about exactly what is being measured (how much of the atmosphere, and the oceans) makes these global-average things really suspect.  For instance, if there’s more oceanic turnover one year, that can warm the deep ocean but cool the shallow ocean and atmosphere, so even though the heat content of the atmosphere-ocean system goes up, some of these “global-average” estimates can go down. The reverse can happen too.  And of course there are various sources of natural variability that are not, these days, what most people are most interested in.  So everybody who knows about the climate professes to hate the emphasis on climate records.  And yet, they’re irresistible.  I’m sure we’ll see the usual clamor of som</p><p>3 0.96371114 <a title="1986-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-07-Hangman_tips.html">1250 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-07-Hangman tips</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

<p>Introduction: Adrien Friggeri has a lovely  visualization  of US Senators movement between clusters:
 
   
 
You have to click the image and play with it to appreciate it. The methodology isn’t yet published – but I can see how this could be very illuminating. The dynamic clustering aspect hasn’t been researched much – one of the notable pieces is the Blei and Lafferty  dynamic topic model of Science .
 
I did a static  analysis of the US Senate  back in 2005 with Wray Buntine and coauthors. Some additional visualizations and the source code are  here . We did a dynamic analysis of US Supreme Court on  this blog  but there’s also a  paper . 
 
My knowledge on this topic is out of date, however. Who has been doing good work in this area? I’ll organize the links.

<p>Introduction: Christian points me to this  interesting (but sad) analysis  by Diego Valle with an impressive series of graphs.  There are a few things I’d change (notably the R default settings which result in ridiculously over-indexed y-axes, as well as axes for homicide rates which should (but do not) go town to zero (and sometimes, bizarrely, go negative), and a lack of coherent ordering of the 32 states (including D.F.),
 
I’m no expert on Mexico (despite having coauthored a paper on Mexican politics) so I’ll leave it to others to evaluate the substantive claims in Valle’s blog.  Just looking at what he’s done, though, it seems impressive to me.  To put it another way, it’s like something Nate Silver might do.</p><p>6 0.95942783 <a title="1986-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-17-Yes%2C_your_wish_shall_be_granted_%28in_25_years%29.html">665 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-17-Yes, your wish shall be granted (in 25 years)</a></p>

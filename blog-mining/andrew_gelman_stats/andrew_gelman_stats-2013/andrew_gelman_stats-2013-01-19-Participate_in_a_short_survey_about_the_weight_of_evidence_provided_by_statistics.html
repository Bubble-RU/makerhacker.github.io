<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>3 0.1334746 <a title="1681-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-14-Job_opening_at_NIH_for_an_experienced_statistician.html">660 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-14-Job opening at NIH for an experienced statistician</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rink Hoekstra writes:
  
A couple of months ago, you were visiting the University of Groningen, and after the talk you gave there I spoke briefly with you about a study that I conducted with Richard Morey, Jeff Rouder and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers. In the study, we found that researchers’  knowledge of how to interpret a confidence interval (CI), was almost as limited as the knowledge of students who had had no inferential statistics course yet. Our manuscript was recently accepted for publication in  Psychonomic Bulletin & Review , and it’s now available online (see e.g.,  here ). Maybe it’s interesting to discuss on your blog, especially since CIs are often promoted (for example in the new guidelines of Psychological Science ), but apparently researchers seem to have little idea how to interpret them. Given that the confidence percentage of a CI tells something about the procedure rather than about the data at hand, this might be understandable, but, according to us, it’s problematic neve</p><p>5 0.1179347 <a title="1681-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed_or_two-tailed%3F.html">2295 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed or two-tailed?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: The other day on the sister blog we  discussed  a recent Pew Research survey that seemed to show that Republicans are becoming more partisan about evolution (or, as Paul Krugman put it, “So what happened after 2009 that might be driving Republican views? . . . Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”).
 
We presented some discussion and evidence from Dan Kahan suggesting that the evidence for such a change was not so clear at all.  Kahan drew his conclusions from a more detailed analysis of the much-discussed Pew data, along with a comparison to a recent Gallup poll.
 
Also following up on this is sociologist David Wealiem, who pulls some more data into the discussion:

We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>5 0.69013327 <a title="1681-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-Where_do_theories_come_from%3F.html">1861 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-Where do theories come from?</a></p>

A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

<p>Introduction: Richard Morey writes:
  
Rink Hoekstra and I are undertaking some research to explore how people use classical statistical results to evaluate the weight of evidence. Bayesians often critique classical techniques for being difficult to interpret in terms of what scientists want to know, but there is clearly information in the statistics themselves. We wonder how people extract that information. Below is our official announcement; it would be great if you could let people on your blog know about the survey, as we want to get a wide variety of statistical users to take the survey.


Announcement follows:

 
Empirical science is grounded on the belief that data can be used as evidence. The convincingness of data — the “weight” of the evidence they provide — is crucial to deciding between rival scientific positions. In situations with no uncertainty, reasoning about evidence is often straightforward; in practice, however, most conclusions from data involve uncertainty. In these situations,</p><p>2 0.97103959 <a title="1681-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-07-Update_on_the_new_Handbook_of_MCMC.html">844 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-07-Update on the new Handbook of MCMC</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Business statistician  Kaiser Fung  just came out with another book, this one full of stories about how organizations use data:
 
1.  Why do law school deans send each other junk mail?
 
2.  Can a new statistic make us less fat?
 
3.  How can sellouts ruin a business?
 
4.  Will personalizing deals save Groupon?
 
5.  Why do marketers send you mixed messages?
 
6.  Are they new jobs if no one can apply?
 
7.  How much did you pay for the eggs?
 
8.  Are you a better coach or manager?
 
Unlike most books of this sort, there’s no hero:  These are not stories about a fabulous businessman who made millions of dollars by following his dream and taking the customer seriously, nor are they Gladwellian sagas of brilliant scientists, nor are they auto-Gladwellian tales of the Ariely variety.  In some ways, the stories in Fung’s book have the form of opened-up business reporting, in which you get to see the statistical models underlying various assumptions and conclusions.  In that sense, this b</p><p>4 0.96257806 <a title="1681-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-24-Sometimes_the_raw_numbers_are_better_than_a_percentage.html">108 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-24-Sometimes the raw numbers are better than a percentage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  NY Times Environment blog entry  summarizes an  article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  that looks into whether there really is a “scientific consensus” that humans are substantially changing the climate.  There is.  That’s pretty much “dog bites man” as far as news is concerned.  But although the results of the study don’t seem noteworthy, I was struck by this paragraph in the blog writeup, which is pretty much a quote of the PNAS article:
  
For example, of the top 50 climate researchers identified by the study (as ranked by the number of papers they had published), only 2 percent fell into the camp of climate dissenters. Of the top 200 researchers, only 2.5 percent fell into the dissenter camp. That is consistent with past work, including opinion polls, suggesting that 97 to 98 percent of working climate scientists accept the evidence for human-induced climate change.
  
Two percent of the top 50, that’s one person.  And 2.5 percent of the top 200, that’s five</p><p>5 0.96097016 <a title="1681-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-Where_do_theories_come_from%3F.html">1861 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-Where do theories come from?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lee Sechrest sends along  this article  by Brian Haig and writes that it “presents what seems to me a useful perspective on much of what scientists/statisticians do and how science works, at least in the fields in which I work.”  Here’s Haig’s abstract: 
  
  
A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

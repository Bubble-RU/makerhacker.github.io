<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.

<p>Introduction: In our recent  discussion  of plagiarism and fake quotes, a commenter points to two recent posts by Mark Liberman ( here  and  here ) where Liberman links to about a zillion cases of journalists publishing quotes that were never said.
 
He goes into some detail about two journalists from the New Yorker:  Jared Diamond, who created quotes from a some dude in Papua New Guinea (ironically, one of Diamond’s accusers here is the widow of Stephen Jay Gould), and Janet Malcolm, who not only apparently falsified quotes by a subject of one of her articles, she also may have faked the notes for her interviews.
 
I didn’t know that particular bit about Janet Malcolm, but I’ve felt very uncomfortable about her ever since she her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.  Between that case and her earlier The Journalist and the Murderer, Malcolm really does seem to have some sort of sympathy for people who kill their family members. She’s a good writer, but I still find</p><p>4 0.074446566 <a title="2025-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-18-What%E2%80%99s_my_Kasparov_number%3F.html">2105 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-18-What’s my Kasparov number?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Personally my Kasparov number is two: I beat ** in a regular tournament game, and ** beat Kasparov!
  
That’s pretty impressive, especially given that I didn’t know this guy played chess at all!  Anyway, this got me thinking, what’s my Kasparov number?  OK, that’s easy.  I beat Magnus Carlsen the other day when he was passing through town on vacation, Carlsen beat Anand, . . .
 
OK, just kidding.  What  is  my Kasparov number, though? Note that the definition, unlike that of the Erdos or Bacon numbers, is asymmetric:  it has to be that I had a victory over person 1, and person 1 had a victory over person 2, etc., and ultimately person N-1 had a victory over Kasparov.  The games don’t have to be in time order, they just all have to be victories.  And we’ll further require that the games all be played after childhood and before senility (i.e., it doesn’t count if I happened to play someone who happens to be a cousin of some grandmaster whom he beat when they were b</p><p>5 0.071914941 <a title="2025-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Online_Education_and_Jazz.html">1752 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Online Education and Jazz</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to this  interesting article  by Vasik Rajlich and Frederic Friedel.  I find these sorts of things fun to read, but the horrible thing is that I just get worse and worse as a player.  I seem to have lost the ability to automatically filter out the worst moves.  Not that I was ever any good, but now I can’t seem to go five moves without making a major blunder.  I’m seriously thinking about never leaving any pieces unprotected even for a single move, just so I don’t have to worry about forgetting about them.

<p>Introduction: I was reading a book of Alfred Kazin’s letters—I don’t know if they’d be so interesting to someone who hadn’t already read a bunch of his  stuff , but I found them pretty interesting—and came across this amazing bit, dated August 11, 1957:
 
 
 
No, really, Al.  Tell us what you really feel.  This was in his private diary, so I can’t really criticize him for it.  And all of us have private thoughts, sometimes publicly expressed, that are unworthy of our better self.  For example, once I was crossing a street and a taxi driver came dangerously close, and I screamed at him, “Go back to your own country, you #&@#%*^&.”  So I’m not claiming that I’m any better than Kazin.  I just thought that quote was pretty amazing.  I guess that’s how (some) people thought, back in the fifties.
 
Also interesting that he wrote “ass-hole” in that context.  The hyphen surprised me, also I don’t think people would use that word in this way anymore.  Nowadays I think of an asshole as a person, not a place.</p><p>6 0.71082664 <a title="2025-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-02-The_new_Helen_DeWitt_novel.html">886 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-02-The new Helen DeWitt novel</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I happened to be looking at Slate (I know, I know, but I’d already browsed Gawker and I was desperately avoiding doing real work) and came across this  article  by Alice Gregory entitled, “I Read Everything Janet Malcolm Ever Published. I’m in awe of her.”
 
I too think Malcolm is an excellent writer, but (a) I’m not happy that she gets off the hook for  faking quotes , and (b) I’m really really not happy with her  apparent attempt  to try to force a mistrial for a convicted killer.
 
I just can’t get over that, for some reason.  I can appreciate Picasso’s genius even though he beat his wives or whatever it was he did, I can enjoy the music of Jackson Browne, etc.  But for some reason this Malcolm stuff sticks in my craw.  There’s no deep meaning to this—I recognize it is a somewhat irrational attitude on my part, I just wanted to share it with you.</p><p>2 0.88713467 <a title="2025-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic%21.html">1580 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic!</a></p>

I’ve been translating a few ongoing data analysis projects into  Stan  code, mostly with success. The most important for me right now has been a hierarchical zero-inflated gamma problem. This a “hurdle” model, in which a bernoulli GLM produces zeros/nonzeros, and then a gamma GLM produces the nonzero values, using varying effects correlated with those in the bernoulli process.


The data are 20 years of human foraging returns from a subsistence hunting population in Paraguay (the Ache), comprising about 15k hunts in total (Hill & Kintigh. 2009. Current Anthropology 50:369-377). Observed values are kilograms of meat returned to camp. The more complex models contain a 147-by-9 matrix of varying effects (147 unique hunters), as well as imputation of missing values.


Originally, I had written the sampler myself in raw R code. It was very slow, but I knew what it was doing at least. Just before Stan version 1.0 was released, I had managed to get JAGS to do it a</p><p>3 0.87247193 <a title="2025-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

I ran several large-N experiments (separate participants) and looked at performance against age. What we want to do is compare age-of-peak-performance across the different tasks (again, different participants).


We bootstrapped age-of-peak-performance. On each iteration, we sampled (with replacement) the X scores at each age, where X=num of participants at that age, and recorded the age at which performance peaked on that task. We then recorded the age at which performance was at peak and repeated. Once we had distributions of age-of-peak-performance, we used the means and SDs to calculate t-statistics to compare the results across different tasks. For graphical presentation, we used medians, interquartile ranges, and 95% confidence intervals (based on the distributions: the range within which 75% and 95% of the bootstrapped peaks appeared).

<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>6 0.86681724 <a title="2025-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-28-Path_sampling_for_models_of_varying_dimension.html">1089 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-28-Path sampling for models of varying dimension</a></p>

In recent years, psychology and medicine have been rocked by scandals of research fraud. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of serious flaws in the general practices of statistics for scientific research, to the extent that top journals routinely publish claims that are implausible and cannot be replicated. All this is occurring despite (or perhaps because of?) statistical tools such as Type 1 error control that are supposed to restrict the rate of unreliable claims. We consider ways in which prior information and Bayesian methods might help resolve these problems.

<p>Introduction: From August 1990.  It was in the form of a note sent to all the people in the statistics group of Bell Labs, where I’d worked that summer.
  
To all:


Here’s the abstract of the work I’ve done this summer.  It’s stored in the file, 
/fs5/gelman/abstract.bell, and copies of the Figures 1-3 are on Trevor’s desk. 
Any comments are of course appreciated; I’m at gelman@stat.berkeley.edu.

In probability and statistics we can often specify multivariate distributions 
many of whose properties we do not fully understand–perhaps, as in the 
Ising model of statistical physics, we can write the joint density function, up 
to a multiplicative constant that cannot be expressed in closed form. 
For an example in statistics, consider the Normal random 
effects model in the analysis of variance, which can be 
easily placed in a Bayesian fram</p><p>6 0.1664083 <a title="2081-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-Say_again%3F.html">169 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-Say again?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was given the opportunity to briefly comment on the  paper , A Bayesian approach to complex clinical diagnoses: a case-study in child abuse, by Nicky Best, Deborah Ashby, Frank Dunstan, David Foreman, and Neil McIntosh, for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.  Here is what I wrote:
  
Best et al. are working on an important applied problem and I have no reason to doubt that their approach is a step forward beyond diagnostic criteria based on point estimation.  An attempt at an accurate assessment of variation is important not just for statistical reasons but also because scientists have the duty to convey their uncertainty to the larger world.  I am thinking, for example, of discredited claims such as that of the mathematician who claimed to predict divorces with 93% accuracy (Abraham, 2010).


Regarding the paper at hand, I thought I would try an experiment in comment-writing.  My usual practice is to read the graphs and then go back and clarify any questions through the t</p><p>6 0.51200479 <a title="2081-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-29-%E2%80%9CCommunication_is_a_central_task_of_statistics%2C_and_ideally_a_state-of-the-art_data_analysis_can_have_state-of-the-art_displays_to_match%E2%80%9D.html">1552 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-29-“Communication is a central task of statistics, and ideally a state-of-the-art data analysis can have state-of-the-art displays to match”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The talk  is at the University of Amsterdam in the Diamantbeurs (Weesperplein 4, Amsterdam), room 5.01, at noon.
 
Here’s the plan:
  
Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?


In recent years, psychology and medicine have been rocked by scandals of research fraud. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of serious flaws in the general practices of statistics for scientific research, to the extent that top journals routinely publish claims that are implausible and cannot be replicated. All this is occurring despite (or perhaps because of?) statistical tools such as Type 1 error control that are supposed to restrict the rate of unreliable claims. We consider ways in which prior information and Bayesian methods might help resolve these problems.
  
I don’t know how organized this talk will be. It combines a bunch of ideas that have been floating around recently. Here are a few recent articles that</p><p>2 0.94694066 <a title="2081-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-18-Christopher_Hitchens_was_a_Bayesian.html">1067 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-18-Christopher Hitchens was a Bayesian</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 1.
 
We Bayesian statisticians like to say there are three kinds of statisticians:
 
a.  Bayesians; 
b.  People who are Bayesians but don’t realize it (that is, they act in coherence with some unstated probability); 
c.  Failed Bayesians (that is, people whose inference could be improved by some attention to coherence).
 
So, if a statistician does great work, we are inclined to claim this person for the Bayesian cause, even if he or she vehemently denies any Bayesian leanings.

In his autobiography, Bertrand Russell tells the story of when he went to prison for opposing World War 1:
  
I [Russell] was much cheered on my arrival by the warden at the gate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion, and I replied ‘agnostic.’ He asked how to spell it, and remarked with a sigh: “Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.” This remark kept me cheerful for about a week.

<p>Introduction: There’s lots of overlap but I put each paper into only one category.  Also, I’ve included work that has been published in 2013 as well as work that has been completed this year and might appear in 2014 or later.  So you can can think of this list as representing roughly two years’ work.

<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.  I’d like to think that if</p><p>5 0.925879 <a title="2081-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-23-My_talk_Tues_24_Sept_at_12h30_at_Universit%C3%A9_de_Technologie_de_Compi%C3%A8gne.html">2034 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-23-My talk Tues 24 Sept at 12h30 at Université de Technologie de Compiègne</a></p>

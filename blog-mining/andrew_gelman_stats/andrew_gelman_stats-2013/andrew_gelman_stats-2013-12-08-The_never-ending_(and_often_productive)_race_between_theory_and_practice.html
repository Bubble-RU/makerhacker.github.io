<p>Introduction: The New York Times has a feature in its Tuesday science section, Take a Number, to which I occasionally contribute (see  here  and  here ).
 
Today’s  column , by Nicholas Balakar, is in error.  The column begins:
  
When medical researchers report their findings, they need to know whether their result is a real effect of what they are testing, or just a random occurrence. To figure this out, they most commonly use the p-value.
  
This is wrong on two counts.  First, whatever researchers might feel, this is something they’ll never know.  Second, results are a combination of real effects and chance, it’s not either/or.
 
Perhaps the above is a forgivable simplification, but I don’t think so; I think it’s a simplification that destroys the reason for writing the article in the first place.  But in any case I think there’s no excuse for this, later on:
  
By convention, a p-value higher than 0.05 usually indicates that the results of the study, however good or bad, were probably due only</p><p>4 0.13042523 <a title="2127-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-14-Learning_from_failure.html">1264 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-14-Learning from failure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was talking with education researcher Bob Boruch about my frustrations in teaching, the idea that as statisticians we tell people to do formal experimentation but in our own teaching practice we typically just try different things without even measuring outcomes, let alone performing any formal evaluation.

<p>Introduction: Lasso and me 
 
For a long time I was wrong about lasso.
 
Lasso (“least absolute shrinkage and selection operator”) is a regularization procedure that shrinks regression coefficients toward zero, and in its basic form is equivalent to maximum penalized likelihood estimation with a penalty function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients.
 
I first heard about lasso from a talk that  Trevor Hastie  Rob Tibshirani gave at Berkeley in 1994 or 1995.  He demonstrated that it shrunk regression coefficients to zero.  I wasn’t impressed, first because it seemed like no big deal (if that’s the prior you use, that’s the shrinkage you get) and second because, from a Bayesian perspective, I don’t  want  to shrink things all the way to zero.  In the sorts of social and environmental science problems I’ve worked on, just about nothing is zero.  I’d like to control my noisy estimates but there’s nothing special about zero.

<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.
 
 Fernando:   Incentives? Impact factors? Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . .

<p>Introduction: Lee Sechrest sends along  this article  by Brian Haig and writes that it “presents what seems to me a useful perspective on much of what scientists/statisticians do and how science works, at least in the fields in which I work.”  Here’s Haig’s abstract: 
  
  
A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

Despite the myriad rules and procedures of science, some research findings are pure flukes. Perhaps you’re testing a new drug, and by chance alone, a large number of people spontaneously get better. The better your study is conducted, the lower the chance that your result was a fluke – but still, there is always a certain probability that it was.


Statistical significance testing gives you an idea of what this probability is.


In science we’re always testing hypotheses. We never conduct a study to ‘see what happens’, because there’s always at least one way to make any useless set of data look important.

After the recent EconNobel announcement I decided to check Dimensional’s Fama-French blog to see if it had much new content recently, and while it was dissapointingly sparse it did have an interesting bit where Fama linked to the  best advice he’d ever gotten , from his statistics professor Harry Roberts:

 
With formal statistics, you say something — a hypothesis — and then you test it. Harry always said that your criterion should be not whether or not you can reject or accept the hypothesis, but what you can learn from the data. The best thing you can do is use the data to enhance your description of the world.
 
  
I responded:  That’s a great quote. Except that I disagree with what Fama says about “formal statistics.” Or, should I say, he has an old-fashioned view of formal statistics. (See  this paper  by X and me for some discussion of old-fashioned views.) Nowadays, lots of formal statistics is all about what you can learn from the data, no</p><p>2 0.98479354 <a title="2127-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-21-The_future_%28and_past%29_of_statistical_sciences.html">2072 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-21-The future (and past) of statistical sciences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In connection with  this  workshop, I was asked to write a few paragraphs describing my perspective on “the current and near-term future state of the statistical sciences you are most familiar with.”  Here’s what I wrote:
  
I think that, at any given time, the field of statistics has a core, but that core changes over time.  There are different paradigmatic ways to solve problems.


100 or 150 years ago, the thing to do was to identify a phenomenon of interest with some probability distribution and then use the mathematics of that distribution to gain insight into the underlying process.  Thus, for example, if certain data looked like they came from a normal distribution, one could surmise that the values in question arose by adding many small independent pieces.  If the data looked like they came from a binomial distribution, that would imply independence and equal probabilities.  Waiting times that followed an exponential distribution could be considered as coming from a memoryless</p><p>3 0.98416889 <a title="2127-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-03-Booze%3A_Been_There._Done_That..html">2158 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-03-Booze: Been There.

<p>Introduction: Our research assistants have unearthed the following guest column by H. L. Mencken which appeared in the New York Times of 5 Nov 1933, the date at which Prohibition ended in the United States. As a public service we are reprinting it here.
 
I’m particularly impressed at how the Sage of Baltimore buttressed his article with references to the latest scientific literature of the time. I think you’ll all agree that Mencken’s column, in which he took a stand against the legality of alcohol consumption, has  contemporary relevance , more than 80 years later.
 
Because of the challenge of interpreting decades-old references, we have asked a leading scholar of Mencken’s writings to add notes where appropriate, to clarify any points of confusion. And now here’s Mencken’s column (with notes added in brackets), in its entirety:
  
For a little while in my teenage years, my friends and I drank alcohol. It was fun. I have some fond memories of us all being silly together.

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
I’ve read your  paper  and  presentation  showing why you don’t usually worry about multiple comparisons.  I see how that applies when you are comparing results across multiple settings (states, etc.).


Does the same principle hold when you are exploring data to find interesting relationships?  For example, you have some data, and you’re trying a series of models to see which gives you the most useful insight.  Do you try your models on a subset of the data so you have another subset for confirmatory analysis later, or do you simply throw all the data against your models?
  
My reply:  I’d like to estimate all the relationships at once and use a multilevel model to do partial pooling to handle the mutiplicity issues.  That said, in practice, in my applied work I’m always bouncing back and forth between different hypotheses and different datasets, and often I learn a lot when next year’s data come in and I can modify my hypotheses.

<p>Introduction: Manoel Galdino wrote in a comment off-topic on another post (which I erased):
  

I know you commented before about patents on statistical methods. Did you know this patent ( http://www.archpatent.com/patents/8032473 )? Do you have any comment on patents that don’t describe mathematically how it works and how and if they’re any different from previous methods? And what about the lack of scientific validation of the claims in such a method?

  
The patent in question, “US 8032473: “Generalized reduced error logistic regression method,” begins with the following “claim”:
  

A system for machine learning comprising: a computer including a computer-readable medium having software stored thereon that, when executed by said computer, performs a method comprising the steps of being trained to learn a logistic regression match to a target class variable so to exhibit classification learning by which: an estimated error in each variable’s moment in the logistic regression be modeled and reduce</p><p>6 0.98236978 <a title="2127-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-09-R_on_the_cloud.html">793 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-09-R on the cloud</a></p>

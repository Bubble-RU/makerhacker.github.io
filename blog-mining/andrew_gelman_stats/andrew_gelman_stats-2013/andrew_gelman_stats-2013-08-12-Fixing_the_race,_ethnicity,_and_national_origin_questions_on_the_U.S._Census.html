<p>Introduction: Frank Hansen writes:
  
I [Hansen] signed up for my first marathon race. Everyone asks me my predicted time. The predictors online seem geared to or are based off of elite runners. And anyway they seem a bit limited.


So I decided to do some analysis of my own.
      
I was going to put together a web page where people could get their race time predictions, maybe sell some ads for sports gps watches, but it might also be publishable.


I have 2 requests which obviously I don’t want you to spend more than a few seconds on.


1. I was wondering if you knew of any sports performance researchers working on performance of not just elite athletes, but the full range of runners. 


2. Can you suggest a way to do multilevel modeling of this. There are several natural subsets for the data but it’s not obvious what makes sense. I describe the data below.


3. Phil (the runner/co-blogger who posted about weight loss) might be interested.

<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.

<p>Introduction: Sam Roberts  writes :
  
The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>3 0.70263731 <a title="1978-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-30-Sorry%2C_Senator_DeMint%3A_Most_Americans_Don%E2%80%99t_Want_to_Ban_Gays_from_the_Classroom.html">381 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-30-Sorry, Senator DeMint: Most Americans Don’t Want to Ban Gays from the Classroom</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Justin Phillips placed some questions on the  YouGov Model Politics poll  and reports the following:
     
Early this month, Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) angered gay rights organizations when he said that openly gay people (along with sexually active unmarried women) shouldn’t be teaching in the classroom.  This comment was originally reported in the Spartanberg Herald-Journal and subsequently covered by a variety of national media outlets including CBS News.


The Senator justified his comments by suggesting that his beliefs are shared by many Americans.  DeMint told the Herald Journal “[When I said those things] no one came to my defense. But everyone would come to me and whisper that I shouldn’t back down. They don’t want government purging their rights and their freedom to religion.”


So is the Senator correct?  Do Americans want openly gay men and women out of the classroom? . . .


Most Americans do not share Senator DeMint’s views. Our survey shows that a large majorit</p><p>4 0.63417512 <a title="1978-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-18-Is_it_really_true_that_only_8%25_of_people_who_buy_Herbalife_products_are_Herbalife_distributors%3F.html">1679 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-18-Is it really true that only 8% of people who buy Herbalife products are Herbalife distributors?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>5 0.6221416 <a title="1978-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-God%2C_Guns%2C_and_Gaydar%3A__The_Laws_of_Probability_Push_You_to_Overestimate_Small_Groups.html">142 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-God, Guns, and Gaydar:  The Laws of Probability Push You to Overestimate Small Groups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

<p>Introduction: Jouni Kerman did a cool bit of research justifying the Beta (1/3, 1/3) prior as noninformative for binomial data, and the Gamma (1/3, 0) prior for Poisson data.
 
You probably thought that nothing new could be said about noninformative priors in such basic problems, but you were wrong!
 
Here’s  the story :
  
The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events. As alternative default conjugate priors, I [Jouni] introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and Gamma(1/3, 0), which I cal</p><p>2 0.98906207 <a title="1978-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-31-Paying_survey_respondents.html">1437 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-31-Paying survey respondents</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  agree  with  Casey Mulligan  that participants in government surveys should be paid, and I think it should be part of the code of ethics for commercial pollsters to compensate their respondents also.
 
As Mulligan points out, if a survey is worth doing, it should be worth compensating the participants for their time and effort.
 
P.S.  Just to clarify, I do  not  recommend that Census surveys be made voluntary, I just think that respondents (who can be required to participate) should be paid a small amount.
 
P.P.S.

An excuse to think about form, colour and style for plotting almost individual observation likelihoods – while invoking the artists privilege of refusing to give interpretations of their own work.
 
In order to make it possibly less dry I’ll try to use intuitive suggestive captions like in this example  TheTyranyof13.pdf 
 
thereby side stepping the technical discussions like here  RadfordNealBlog 
 
Suggested models and data sets (or even submissions) would be most appreciated.
 
I likely be sticking to realism i.e. plots that represent ‘statistical reality’ faithfully.

<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>5 0.97765094 <a title="1978-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-30-New_innovations_in_spam.html">545 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-30-New innovations in spam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email today:
  
Hello Andrew,


I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.


Sincerely, 
Samantha Rhodes

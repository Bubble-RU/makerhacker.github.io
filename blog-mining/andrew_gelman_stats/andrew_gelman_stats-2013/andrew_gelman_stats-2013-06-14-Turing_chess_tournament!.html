I see you have a blog post about turing chess . . . I’ve seen another reference to it but am unable to find a definitive source. Do you know of a source where I could find out about the history of the idea?
  
My reply:
 
You mean the run-around-the-house thing?  I don’t know where it comes from.  It’s a well known story, if you google Turing chess run around the house you can find lots of references but I don’t know the definitive source.  I can blog and see if anything comes up!
 
I’ve never actually played the game.  I’ll try it outdoors sometime, perhaps.  When I last  posted  on the topic, we had a fun discussion, revealing that the rules are not as clear as one might think.  It makes me wonder if anyone’s thought hard about it and come up with a good set of “official rules.”
 
Any thoughts?</p><p>3 0.18015559 <a title="1899-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-12-Niall_Ferguson%2C_the_John_Yoo_line%2C_and_the_paradox_of_influence.html">1493 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-12-Niall Ferguson, the John Yoo line, and the paradox of influence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Life is continuous but we think in discrete terms.  In applied statistics there’s the p=.05 line which tells us whether a finding is significant or not.  Baseball has the Mendoza line.
 
And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site. The fee: 50 to 75 grand per appearance. . . .

<p>Introduction: Ashok Rao  shreds  the latest book from Niall Ferguson, who we’ve  encountered  most recently as the source of homophobic slurs but who used to be a  serious scholar . Or maybe still is. Remember Linda, that character from the Kahneman and Tversky vignette who was deemed likely to be “a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement”? Maybe Ferguson is a serious scholar who is active in the being-a-hack movement. Perhaps when he’s  not  writing books where he distorts his sources, or giving lectures with unfortunate slurs, he’s doing historical research. It’s certainly possible.
 
Rao describes how Ferguson distorts his source materials.  This is a no-no for any historian, of course, but not such a surprise for Ferguson, who crossed over the  John Yoo line  awhile ago.
 
Last year I wrote about the paradox of influence:  Ferguson gets and keeps the big-money audience by telling them not what he (Ferguson) wants to say—not by giving them his unique insights and understanding—but rat</p><p>5 0.17511225 <a title="1899-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-04-Jesus_historian_Niall_Ferguson_and_the_improving_standards_of_public_discourse.html">1839 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-04-Jesus historian Niall Ferguson and the improving standards of public discourse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

<p>Introduction: In  our discussion  of historian Niall Ferguson and piss-poor monocausal social science, commenter Matt W. pointed to Ferguson’s listing at a speakers bureau.  One of his talks is entitled “Is This the Chinese Century?”  The question mark at the end seems to give him some wiggle room.
 
I give some paid lectures myself and was curious to learn more about this organization, World Class Speakers and Entertainers, so I clicked through to  this list of topics  and then searched for Statistics.  Amazingly enough, there was a “Statistician” category (right above “Story Teller / Lore / Art / Power of Story Telling,” “Strategist / Strategies / Strategic Planning,” and “Success”).
 
There I found  Gopal C. Dorai, Ph.D. , who offers insights such as “vegetarians usually will not eat meat products, no matter how hungry they feel.”  And “Cheating or lying for the sake of obtaining favorable treatment from others will be anathema to some people.”  And “Life is a one-way-street; we cannot turn the c</p><p>3 0.74267095 <a title="1899-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-04-One_more_thought_on_Hoover_historian_Niall_Ferguson%E2%80%99s_thing_about_Keynes_being_gay_and_marrying_a_ballerina_and_talking_about_poetry.html">1840 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-04-One more thought on Hoover historian Niall Ferguson’s thing about Keynes being gay and marrying a ballerina and talking about poetry</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We had some interesting comments on our recent  reflections  on Niall Ferguson’s ill-chosen remarks in which he attributed Keynes’s economic views (I don’t actually know exactly what Keyesianism is, but I think a key part is for the government to run surpluses during economic booms and deficits during recessions) to the Keynes being gay and marrying a ballerina and talking about poetry.  The general idea, I think, is that people without kids don’t care so much about the future, and this motivated Keynes’s party-all-the-time attitude, which might have worked just fine for Eddie Murphy’s girlfriend in the 1980s and in San Francisco bathhouses of the 1970s but, according to Ferguson, is not the ticket for preserving today’s American empire.
 
Some of the more robust defenders of Ferguson may have been disappointed by his followup remarks:  “I should not have suggested . . . that Keynes was indifferent to the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children because he was g</p><p>4 0.72862279 <a title="1899-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-03-Absolutely_last_Niall_Ferguson_post_ever%2C_in_which_I_offer_him_serious_advice.html">1040 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-03-Absolutely last Niall Ferguson post ever, in which I offer him serious advice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of reading  this article  by Niall Ferguson summarizing his  notorious  new book.  Here’s the best bit: 
  
  
Far more than in Europe, most Americans remain instinctively loyal to the killer applications of Western ascendancy, from competition all the way through to the work ethic. They know the country has the right software. They just can’t understand why it’s running so damn slowly.


What we need to do is to delete the viruses that have crept into our system: the anticompetitive quasi monopolies that blight everything from banking to public education; the politically correct pseudosciences and soft subjects that deflect good students away from hard science; the lobbyists who subvert the rule of law for the sake of the special interests they represent—to say nothing of our crazily dysfunctional system of health care, our overleveraged personal finances, and our newfound unemployment ethic.

<p>Introduction: Follow the  Amazon link  and check to see  if it’s still on sale .
 
P.S.  I don’t make any money through this link.  We do get some royalties from the book, but only a very small amount.  I’m pushing the Amazon link right now because (a) I think the book is great, and I want as many people as possible to have it, and (b) 40% off is a pretty good deal and I don’t know how long this will last.
 
P.P.S.  Just so this post has some statistical content,  here’s one of my favorite papers , Bayesian model-building by pure thought: some principles and examples.  It’s from 1996, and here’s the abstract:</p><p>3 0.17818256 <a title="1984-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-03-Suggested_reading_for_a_prospective_statistician%3F.html">316 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-03-Suggested reading for a prospective statistician?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sam Jessup writes:
  
I am writing to ask you to recommend papers, books–anything that comes to mind that might give a prospective statistician some sense of what the future holds for statistics (and statisticians). I have a liberal arts background with an emphasis in mathematics. It seems like this is an exciting time to be a statistician, but that’s just from the outside looking in. I’m curious about your perspective on the future of the discipline.
  
Any recommendations?  My favorite is still the book, “Statistics:  A Guide to the Unknown,” first edition.  (I actually have a chapter in the latest (fourth) edition, but I think the first edition (from 1972, I believe) is still the best.</p><p>4 0.17256345 <a title="1984-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-Improvements_to_Kindle_Version_of_BDA3.html">1993 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-Improvements to Kindle Version of BDA3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>5 0.14656335 <a title="1984-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-Bayes_in_China_update.html">517 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-Bayes in China update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>6 0.14169137 <a title="1984-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Amtrak_sucks.html">1255 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Amtrak sucks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ben points us to a new book,  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data .  It’s excellent and I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth the $89.95.  Van Buuren’s book is great even if you don’t end up using the algorithm described in the book (I actually like their approach but I do think there are some limitations with their particular implementation, which is one reason we’re developing our own  package ); he supplies lots of intuition, examples, and graphs. 
   
P.S.  Stef’s book features an introduction by Don Rubin, which gets me thinking:  if Don can find the time to write an introduction to somebody else’s book, he surely should be willing to read and comment on the third edition of his own book, no?</p><p>3 0.82595575 <a title="1984-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-21-%E2%80%9CReadability%E2%80%9D_as_freedom_from_the_actual_sensation_of_reading.html">1179 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-21-“Readability” as freedom from the actual sensation of reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

<p>Introduction: Psychology researcher Chris Chabris  writes :
  
Rolf Dobelli, a Swiss writer, published a book called The Art of Thinking Clearly earlier this year with HarperCollins in the U.S. The book’s original German edition was a #1 bestseller, and the book has sold over one million copies worldwide.


In perusing Mr. Dobelli’s book, we noticed several familiar-sounding passages. On closer examination, we found five instances of unattributed material that is either reproduced verbatim or closely paraphrased from text and arguments in our book, The Invisible Gorilla (Crown, 2010). They are listed at the end of this note.
  
Apparently he ripped off Nassim Taleb  too .
 
A million copies, huh?  I guess crime really does pay!  Maybe he could get an appointment at  Harvard Law School  or, if that falls through, a position as writer-in-residence at the statistics department of George Mason University [no link needed for that one -- ed.].

<p>Introduction: I had a submission a couple years ago that was rejected by a journal.  One of the reviewers began with the following snotty aside:
  
In this manuscript Gelman and Shalizi (there’s no anonymity here; this thing has been floating around the web for some time) . . .
  
Actually, we posted it on the same day we submitted it to the journal.  But double-blindness allowed the reviewer to act as if we had done something wrong!  And, even if it  had  been “floating around the web for some time,” that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Perhaps it just meant that the article had previously been rejected by a bad-attitude reviewer!</p><p>3 0.84444135 <a title="1984-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-28-Every_time_you_take_a_sample%2C_you%E2%80%99ll_have_to_pay_this_guy_a_quarter.html">1398 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-28-Every time you take a sample, you’ll have to pay this guy a quarter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Roy Mendelssohn pointed me to  this  heartwarming story of Jay Vadiveloo, an actuary who got a patent for the idea of statistical sampling.  Vadiveloo writes, “the results were astounding: statistical sampling worked.”
 
You may laugh, but wait till Albedo Man buys the patent and makes everybody do his bidding.  They’re gonna dig up Laplace and make him pay retroactive royalties.  And somehow Clippy will get involved in all this.
 
P.S.  Mendelssohn writes:  “Yes, I felt it was a heartwarming story also.  Perhaps we can get a patent for regression.”
 
I say, forget a patent for regression.  I want a patent for the sample mean.  That’s where the real money is.  You can’t charge a lot for each use, but consider the volume!</p><p>4 0.84208149 <a title="1984-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-05-For_those_of_you_in_the_U.K.%2C_also_an_amusing_paradox_involving_the_infamous_hookah_story.html">504 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-05-For those of you in the U.K., also an amusing paradox involving the infamous hookah story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll be on Radio 4 at 8.40am, on the BBC show “Today,” talking about  The Honest Rainmaker .  I have no idea how the interview went (it was about 5 minutes), but I’m kicking myself because I was planning to tell the hookah story, but I forgot.  Here it is:
  
I was at a panel for the National Institutes of Health evaluating grants. One of the proposals had to do with the study of the effect of water-pipe smoking, the hookah. There was a discussion around the table. The NIH is a United States government organisation; not many people in the US really smoke hookahs; so should we fund it? Someone said, ‘Well actually it’s becoming more popular among the young.’ And if younger people smoke it, they have a longer lifetime exposure, and apparently there is some evidence that the dose you get of carcinogens from hookah smoking might be 20 times the dose of smoking a cigarette. I don’t know the details of the math, but it was a lot. So even if not many people do it, if you multiply the risk, yo</p><p>5 0.83305371 <a title="1984-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-Drug_testing_for_recipents_of_NSF_and_NIH_grants%3F.html">92 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-Drug testing for recipents of NSF and NIH grants?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People seeking unemployment benefits or welfare would have to first pass a drug test under a proposal Sen. Orrin Hatch will try to add to legislation extending the social safety net during this time of economic turmoil.  
 
Hatch … said his idea would help battle drug addiction and could reduce the nation’s debt. He will try to get the Senate to include his amendment to a $140 billion bill extending tax breaks and social programs this week.
 
“This amendment is a way to help people get off of drugs to become productive and healthy members of society, while ensuring that valuable taxpayer dollars aren’t wasted,” he said after announcing his amendment. “Too many Americans are locked into a life of a dangerous dependency not only on drugs, but the federal assistance that serves to enable their addiction.”
 

 
I have a horrible vision of NSF and NIH dollars used to support the amphetamine dependencies of students pulling all-nighters in their bio labs.

<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.

I was recently in a conversation with some colleagues regarding the evaluation of recent welfare reform in California. The discussion centered around what types of design might allow us to understand the impact the changes. Experimental designs were out, as random assignment is not feasible. Our data is pre/post, and some of my colleagues believed that the best we can do under these circumstance was a descriptive study; i.e. no causal inference. All of us were concerned with changes in economic and population changes over the pre-to-post period; i.e. over-estimating the effects in an improving economy. 


I was thought a quasi-experimental design was possible using MLM. Briefly, my suggestion was the following:


Match our post-participants to a set of pre-participants on relevant person level factors, and treat the pre/post differences as a random effect at the county level. Next, we would adjust the pre/post differences by changes in economic and populati</p><p>4 0.10081938 <a title="1884-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Still_more_Mr._P_in_public_health.html">770 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Still more Mr. P in public health</a></p>

I saw  a post  on Andrew Sullivan’s blog today about life expectancy in different US counties. With a bunch of the worst counties being in Mississippi, I thought that it might be another case of analysts getting extreme values from small counties.


However, the paper (see  here ) includes a pretty interesting methods section. This is from page 5, “Specifically, we used a mixed-effects Poisson regression with time, geospatial, and covariate components. Poisson regression fits count outcome variables, e.g., death counts, and is preferable to a logistic model because the latter is biased when an outcome is rare (occurring in less than 1% of observations).”


They have downloadable data. I believe that the data are predicted values from the model. A web appendix also gives 90% CIs for their estimates.


Do you think they solved the small county problem and that the worst counties really are where their spreadsheet suggests?

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I’m aware that there  are  some people who use a Bayesian approach largely because it allows them to provide a highly informative prior distribution based subjective judgment, but that is not the appeal of Bayesian methods for a lot of us practitioners. It’s disappointing and surprising, twenty years after my initial experiences, to still hear highly informed professional statisticians who think that what distinguishes Bayesian statistics from Frequentist statistics is “subjectivity” ( as seen in  a recent blog post and its comments ).
 
 My first encounter with Bayesian statistics was just over 20 years ago. I was a postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a new PhD in theoretical atomic physics but working on various problems related to the geographical and statistical distribution of indoor radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be dangerous if present at high concentrations).

<p>Introduction: Ta-Nehisi Coates recently published  a fascinating column  on the “culture of poverty,” in particular focusing on the idea that behavior that is rational and adaptive in some settings is not so appropriate in others:
  
The set of practices required for a young man to secure his safety on the streets of his troubled neighborhood are not the same as those required to place him on an honor roll . . . The way to guide him through this transition is not to insult his native language. . . .


For black men like us, the feeling of having something to lose, beyond honor and face, is foreign. We grew up in communities—New York, Baltimore, Chicago—where the Code of the Streets was the first code we learned. Respect and reputation are everything there. These values are often denigrated by people who have never been punched in the face. But when you live around violence there is no opting out. A reputation for meeting violence with violence is a shield. That protection increases when you are part</p><p>3 0.81027532 <a title="1884-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Proposal_for_a_moratorium_on_the_use_of_the_words_%E2%80%9Cfashionable%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9Ctrendy%E2%80%9D.html">189 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Proposal for a moratorium on the use of the words “fashionable” and “trendy”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>4 0.78959727 <a title="1884-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-06-Your_conclusion_is_only_as_good_as_your_data.html">1369 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-06-Your conclusion is only as good as your data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  points  to an excellent rant from Peter Moskos, trashing a study about “food deserts” (which I kept reading as “food desserts”) in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Here’s Moskos:
  
From the Times:

 
There is no relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents. 


Within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood, “you can get basically any type of food,” said Roland Sturm of the RAND Corporation, lead author of one of the studies. “Maybe we should call it a food swamp rather than a desert,” he said.
 

Sure thing, Sturm. But I suspect you wouldn’t think certain neighborhoods are swamped with good food if you actually got out of your office and went to one of the neighborhoods. After all, what are going to believe: A nice data set or your lying eyes?

<p>Introduction: Interesting  mini-memoir  from John Podhoretz about the Upper West Side, in his words, “the most affluent shtetl the world has ever seen.”
 
The only part I can’t quite follow is his offhand remark, “It is an expensive place to live, but then it always was.”  I always thought that, before 1985 or so, the Upper West Side wasn’t so upscale.  People at Columbia tell all sorts of stories about how things used to be in the bad old days.
 
I have one other comment.  Before giving it, let me emphasize that enjoyed reading Podhoretz’s article and, by making the comment below, I’m not trying to shoot Podhoretz down; rather, I’m trying to help out by pointing out a habit in his writing that might be getting in the way of his larger messages.
 
Podhoretz writes the following about slum clearance:
  
 
Over the course of the next four years, 20 houses on the block would be demolished and replaced with a high school named for Louis Brandeis and a relocated elementary school.

<p>Introduction: Research psychologist John Jost  reviews  the recent book, “The Righteous Mind,” by research psychologist Jonathan Haidt.  Some of my thoughts on Haidt’s book are  here .  And here’s some of Jost’s review:
  
Haidt’s book is creative, interesting, and provocative. . . . The book shines a new light on moral psychology and presents a bold, confrontational message. From a scientific perspective, however, I worry that his theory raises more questions than it answers. Why do some individuals feel that it is morally good (or necessary) to obey authority, favor the ingroup, and maintain purity, whereas others are skeptical? (Perhaps parenting style is relevant after all.) Why do some people think that it is morally acceptable to judge or even mistreat others such as gay or lesbian couples or, only a generation ago, interracial couples because they dislike or feel disgusted by them, whereas others do not? Why does the present generation “care about violence toward many more classes of victims</p><p>2 0.95779514 <a title="1884-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-08-How_adoption_speed_affects_the_abandonment_of_cultural_tastes.html">845 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-08-How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  article  by Jonah Berger and Gael Le Mens:
  
Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-r</p><p>3 0.9467411 <a title="1884-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-14-Cool-ass_signal_processing_using_Gaussian_processes_%28birthdays_again%29.html">1379 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-14-Cool-ass signal processing using Gaussian processes (birthdays again)</a></p>

Here’s my version of the  birthday frequency graph . I used Gaussian process with two slowly varying components and periodic component with decay, so that periodic form can change in time. I used Student’s t-distribution as observation model to allow exceptional dates to be outliers. I guess that periodic component due to week effect is still in the data because there is data only from twenty years. Naturally it would be better to model the whole timeseries, but it was easier to just use the cvs by Mulligan.
  
   
 
ALl I can say is . . . wow.  Bayes wins again.  Maybe Aki can supply the R or Matlab code?
 
P.S.  And let’s not forget how great the simple and clear time series plots are, compared to various fancy visualizations that people might try.

I have created  an R package  to implement the full likelihood method in Kong et al. (2003). The method can be seen as a binless extension of so-called Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (UWHAM) widely used in physics and chemistry. The method has also been introduced to the physics literature and called the Multivariate Bennet Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method. But a key point of my implementation is to compute the free energy estimates by minimizing a convex function, instead of solving nonlinear equations by the self-consistency or the Newton-Raphson algorithm.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.9399569 <a title="1884-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-05-A_story_of_fake-data_checking_being_used_to_shoot_down_a_flawed_analysis_at_the_Farm_Credit_Agency.html">1884 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-05-A story of fake-data checking being used to shoot down a flawed analysis at the Farm Credit Agency</a></p>

While reading your  postings  [or  here ] on the subject of testing your model by running fake data I was reminded of the fact that I got one of these kinds of tests actually published in a GAO report back in the day.  Reading your posts on Unz and  political vs. economic discourse  made me think of that work again.  I thought I’d actually drop you a line on the subject.


Back in 2003 GAO was asked to look at Farmer Mac, including a look at the Farm Credit Agency’s regulation of Farmer Mac.  As the resident mortgage econometrician back then I was asked to look at FCA’s risk based capital stress test for Farmer Mac.  The work was pretty easy.  I found a lot of oddities, but the biggest one was that they were using a discrete choice set up (loan goes bad or doesn’t) instead of a hazard model (loan goes bad this period or survives to the next).  Not necessarily a problem – lots of mortgage models run that way.

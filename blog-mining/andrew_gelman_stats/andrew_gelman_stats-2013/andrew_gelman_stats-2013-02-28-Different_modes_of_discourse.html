</p><p>2 The short version is that, at first I felt no particular reason to doubt his numbers, but after seeing more data, it became pretty clear to me that Unz had made some mistakes in classification and mistakes in data analysis. [sent-16, score-0.233]
</p><p>3 As I’ve emphasized throughout, this does not make all of Unz’s larger claims false; what this new information does is change the status of Unz’s article from a data-based analysis to an anecdote-based opinion piece containing numbers and comparisons of uneven quality. [sent-17, score-0.256]
</p><p>4 Mertz came into the picture to shoot down two of the most visible numbers in Unz’s article—two numbers that made it into the New York Times, thus reaching a much broader audience than the readership of the American Conservative and Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science. [sent-20, score-0.281]
</p><p>5 When an expert (or even an informed outsider) says our numbers are wrong, we listen (even if we don’t end up agreeing). [sent-43, score-0.212]
</p><p>6 For some period of time, Unz has known that an expert in the field thinks his numbers are off by a factor of 5. [sent-48, score-0.196]
</p><p>7 But he sits on it and then after much criticism on many points, he admits a couple of mistakes but avoids comment on others. [sent-49, score-0.233]
</p><p>8 We’re playing the academic research game, he’s playing the politics game. [sent-59, score-0.208]
</p><p>9 I completely respect Unz’s choice to be a political activist and spend his life trying to change the world through political means (or to stop others from instituting what he believes would be negative changes). [sent-62, score-0.33]
</p><p>10 Calling Unz a political activist or politically-motivated is not an insult. [sent-63, score-0.184]
</p><p>11 Unz is behaving in a perfectly reasonable way  politically , dodging criticism as much as he can, fighting it where appropriate, and occasionally making a strategic concession of as little as possible in order to stay ahead of the story. [sent-68, score-0.228]
</p><p>12 Lots of people loved the maps, but then I got one criticism from the political blogger Kos. [sent-74, score-0.247]
</p><p>13 Or maybe he does realize he’s made some big mistakes but he’s holding back on conceding them until he feels the time is right. [sent-94, score-0.176]
</p><p>14 In Unz’s case, he either knew for weeks or months that some of his numbers were wrong but refused to admit it, or he saw Mertz’s criticism but did not look at it. [sent-99, score-0.343]
</p><p>15 All I can say on that account is that, when Unz’s article came out a few months ago, I had no problem  presenting  its claims as stated; it was only after receiving some recent emails with detailed statistics that I got the impression that Unz’s numbers were mistaken. [sent-109, score-0.252]
</p><p>16 Another possible reason for Unz not to admit some flaws and take a strategic retreat is, of course, that he honestly doesn’t think he made any mistakes (beyond the very few he admitted in his follow-up post). [sent-128, score-0.232]
</p><p>17 But at the same time he believes so strongly in his conclusions that I suspect he feels that even his false numbers are true in some deeper sense. [sent-133, score-0.198]
</p><p>18 From a statistical standpoint, this makes no sense:  after all, if it’s informative to learn that the proportion of Jews in the math olympiad declined by a shocking factor of 17, then it should be informative (in the other direction) that the decline is only a factor of 2 or so. [sent-136, score-0.315]
</p><p>19 I’m not placing scholarly values  above  political values, nor am I implying that scholars always act in how I define the “scholarly” way. [sent-151, score-0.201]
</p><p>20 Second, although (as I’ve written many times) several of Unz’s points remain relevant even after his errors are corrected, his claim of Harvard discriminating in favor of Jews and his claim of a dramatic drop in Jewish accomplishment do  not  hold up to scrutiny. [sent-164, score-0.193]

<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.

In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students.

<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.

<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.

In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.

<p>Introduction: As a statistician I am particularly worried about the rhetorical power of anecdotes (even though I use them in my own reasoning; see discussion below).  But much can be learned from a  true  anecdote.  The rough edges—the places where the anecdote doesn’t fit your thesis—these are where you learn.
 
We have recently had a discussion ( here  and  here ) of Karl Weick, a prominent scholar of business management who plagiarized a story and then went on to draw different lessons from the pilfered anecdote in several different publications published over many years.
 
Setting aside an issues of plagiarism and rulebreaking, I argue that, by hiding the source of the story and changing its form, Weick and his management-science audience are losing their ability to get anything out of it beyond empty confirmation.
 
A full discussion follows.

<p>Introduction: Nurit Baytch posted a document,  A Critique of Ron Unz’s Article “The Myth of American Meritocracy” , that is relevant to an ongoing discussion we had on this blog. Baytch’s article begins:
  
In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show. In addition, Unz’s arguments have proven to be untenable in light of a recent survey of incoming Harvard freshmen conducted by The Harvard Crimson, which found that students who identified as Jewish reported a mean SAT score of 2289</p><p>5 0.96254396 <a title="1743-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-16-Another_day%2C_another_plagiarist.html">1266 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-16-Another day, another plagiarist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>6 0.96070063 <a title="1743-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell_and_Chabris%2C_David_and_Goliath%2C_and_science_writing_as_stone_soup.html">2058 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell and Chabris, David and Goliath, and science writing as stone soup</a></p>

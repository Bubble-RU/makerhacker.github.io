<p>Introduction: From a comment I made in an email exchange:
 
My  work  on survey adjustments has very much been inspired by the ideas of Rod Little.  Much of my efforts have gone toward the goal of integrating hierarchical modeling (which is so helpful for small-area estimation) with post stratification (which adjusts for known differences between sample and population).  In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.
 
As I wrote in the first sentence of the above-linked paper, I do think the current theory and practice of survey weighting is a mess, in that much depends on so</p><p>3 0.17231528 <a title="1814-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-10-Some_interesting_unpublished_ideas_on_survey_weighting.html">705 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-10-Some interesting unpublished ideas on survey weighting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago we had an amazing all-star session at the Joint Statistical Meetings.  The topic was new approaches to survey weighting (which is  a mess , as I’m sure you’ve heard).
 
Xiao-Li Meng  recommended shrinking weights by taking them to a fractional power (such as square root) instead of trimming the extremes. 
 
Rod Little  combined design-based and model-based survey inference. 
 
Michael Elliott  used mixture models for complex survey design. 
 
And here’s  my introduction  to the session.</p><p>4 0.15067622 <a title="1814-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-10-Two_great_tastes_that_taste_great_together.html">25 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-10-Two great tastes that taste great together</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Somebody emailed me:
  
I am a researcher at ** University and I have recently read your article on average predictive comparisons for statistical models published 2007 in the journal “Sociological Methodology”.


Gelman, Andrew/Iain Pardoe. 2007. “Average Predictive Comparisons for Models with Nonlinearity, Interactions, and Variance Components”. Sociological Methodology 37: 23-51.


Currently I am working with multilevel models and find your approach very interesting and useful.


May I ask you whether replication materials (e.g. R Code) for this article are available?
  
I had to reply:
  
Hi—I’m embarrassed to say that our R files are a mess!

<p>Introduction: Steve Miller writes: 
  
  
Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

<p>Introduction: I received the following question:
  
Is there a classic paper on instrumenting for survey non-response?  some colleagues in public health are going to carry out a survey and I wonder about suggesting that they build in a randomization of response-encouragement (e.g. offering additional $ to a subset of those who don’t respond initially).  Can you recommend a basic treatment of this, and why it might or might not make sense compared to IPW using covariates (without an instrument)?
  
My reply:   Here’s  the best analysis I know of on the effects of incentives for survey response.  There have been several survey-experiments on the subject.  The short answer is that the effect on nonresponse is small and the outcome is highly variable, hence you can’t very well use it as an instrument in any particular survey.
 
My recommended approach to dealing with nonresponse is to use multilevel regression and poststratification; an example is  here .

I’m an epidemiologist at Emory University, and I’m working on a project of release patterns in jails (basically trying to model how long individuals are in jail before they’re release, for purposes of designing short-term health interventions, i.e. HIV testing, drug counseling, etc…). The question lends itself to quantile regression; we’re interested in the # of days it takes for 50% and 75% of inmates to be released. But being a clustered/nested data structure, it also obviously lends itself to multilevel modeling, with the group-level being individual jails.


So: do you know of any work on multilevel quantile regression? My quick lit search didn’t yield much, and I don’t see any preprogrammed way to do it in SAS.

<p>Introduction: Having established that survey weighting is a mess, I should also acknowledge that, by this standard, regression modeling is also a mess, involving many arbitrary choices of variable selection, transformations and modeling of interaction. Nonetheless, regression modeling is a mess with which I am comfortable and, perhaps more relevant to the discussion, can be extended using multilevel models to get inference for small cross-classifications or small areas.

Drawing from My Mind’s Eye: 
Dorothea Rockburne in Conversation with David Cohen 
Introduced by Nina Samuel
 
Thursday, November 29 
6 pm 
BGC, 38 West 86th Street
 
Benoît Mandelbrot, unusual among mathematicians of the twentieth century, harnessed the power of visual images to express his theories and to pursue new lines of thought. In this conversation artist Dorothea Rockburne will share memories of studying with mathematician Max Dehn at Black Mountain College, of meeting Mandelbrot, and discuss her recent work.
 
Exhibition curator Nina Samuel will discuss the related exhibition “The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking,” on view in the BGC Focus Gallery through January 27, 2013.
 
  
   
David Cohen is editor and publisher of artcritical.com as well as founder and moderator of The Review Panel.

<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points us to  a discussion in Statistics in Medicine  of the  famous claims  by Christakis and Fowler on the contagion of obesity etc.
 
 
 
 James O’Malley  and  Christakis and Fowler  present the positive case.
 
 Andrew Thomas  and  Tyler VanderWeele  present constructive criticism.
 
Christakis and Fowler  reply .
 
Coincidentally, a couple weeks ago an epidemiologist was explaining to me the differences between the Framingham Heart Study and the Nurses Health Study and why Framingham got the postmenopausal supplement risks right while Nurses got it wrong.
 
P.S.  The journal issue also includes a comment on “A distribution-free test of constant mean in linear mixed effects models.”  Wow!  I had no idea people still did this sort of thing.  How horrible.  But I guess that’s what half-life is all about.  These ideas last forever, they just become less and less relevant to people.</p><p>4 0.92052948 <a title="1814-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-08-Ethical_standards_in_different_data_communities.html">1525 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-08-Ethical standards in different data communities</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>5 0.91829908 <a title="1814-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-03-Somebody_listened_to_me%21.html">1603 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-03-Somebody listened to me!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several months ago, I  wrote :
  
One challenge, though, is that uncovering the problem [of scientific fraud] and forcing the retraction is a near-thankless job. That’s one reason I don’t mind if Uri Simonsohn is treated as some sort of hero or superstar for uncovering multiple cases of research fraud. Some people might feel there’s something unseemly about Simonsohn doing this . . .


OK, fine, but let’s talk incentives. If retractions are a good thing, and fraudsters and plagiarists are not generally going to retract on their own, then somebody’s going to have to do the hard work of discovering, exposing, and confronting scholarly misconduct. If these discoverers, exposers, and confronters are going to be attacked back by their targets (which would be natural enough) and they’re going to be attacked by the fraudsters’ friends and colleagues (also natural) and even have their work disparaged by outsiders who think they’re going too far, then, hey, they need some incentives in the othe</p><p>6 0.91799527 <a title="1814-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-Multilevel_modeling_even_when_you%E2%80%99re_not_interested_in_predictions_for_new_groups.html">1194 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-Multilevel modeling even when you’re not interested in predictions for new groups</a></p>

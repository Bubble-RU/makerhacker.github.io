<p>Introduction: “Where academia meets public life” :
 
 The Changing Face of Violence  
Joel F. Harrington 
A debate has kicked off among scholars on whether we have become inherently more peaceful. A more important question is whether we actually understand the many forms violence takes.
 
 The Professor as Digital Native  
Interview with Mary Beard
 
 Why Central Bank Transparency May Be Overrated  
Brigitte Granville 
Be it ever so brilliant, communication in monetary policy is no panacea in today’s world of slow growth, high debt, and fiscal policy uncertainty.
 
 When Does Digital Activism Pack a Punch?  
Philip N. Howard 
A new project is collecting data to offer insights from digital campaigns around the world.

<p>Introduction: Symposium  is a new online magazine subtitled “Where academia meets public life.”  You can think of it as a sort of Slate magazine without Mickey Kaus, or as the Atlantic without the stylish writing.
 
Here are the articles in the first issue, which has just been posted:
 
 Why Write the History of Capitalism?  
Louis Hyman 
A new generation of scholars is rewriting the story of capitalism by shaking off the old assumptions of both the Left and Right.
 
 Sorry, Wrong Number  
Andrew Gelman 
How do bad numbers get into circulation in our political discourse, and how do they stay there, even after being refuted?
 
 Historians and the Problem of Miracles  
Scott K. Taylor 
Historians, like most academics, are a secular lot. Is this a bias that prevents a deeper understanding of religious history?
 
 The Rebirth of Viewing Pleasure  
Jill Dolan 
By taking a fresh look at popular culture, students are breathing new life into feminist theories of a generation ago.

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  previous post , Andrew Wilson writes:
  
I agree we are in a really exciting time for statistics and machine learning.  There has been a lot of talk lately comparing machine learning with statistics.  I am curious whether you think there are many fundamental differences between the fields, or just superficial differences — different popular approximate inference methods, slightly different popular application areas, etc.  Is machine learning a subset of statistics?


In the paper we discuss how we think machine learning is fundamentally about pattern discovery, and ultimately, fully automating the learning and decision making process.  In other words, whatever a human does when he or she uses tools to analyze data, can be written down algorithmically and automated on a computer.  I am not sure if the ambitions are similar in statistics — and I don’t have any conventional statistics background, which makes it harder to tell. I think it’s an interesting discussion.</p><p>6 0.086751021 <a title="1969-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-07-Looking_for_a_purpose_in_life%3A__Update_on_that_underworked_and_overpaid_sociologist_whose_%E2%80%9Cmain_task_as_a_university_professor_was_self-cultivation%E2%80%9D.html">750 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-07-Looking for a purpose in life:  Update on that underworked and overpaid sociologist whose “main task as a university professor was self-cultivation”</a></p>

Drawing from My Mind’s Eye: 
Dorothea Rockburne in Conversation with David Cohen 
Introduced by Nina Samuel
 
Thursday, November 29 
6 pm 
BGC, 38 West 86th Street
 
Benoît Mandelbrot, unusual among mathematicians of the twentieth century, harnessed the power of visual images to express his theories and to pursue new lines of thought. In this conversation artist Dorothea Rockburne will share memories of studying with mathematician Max Dehn at Black Mountain College, of meeting Mandelbrot, and discuss her recent work.
 
Exhibition curator Nina Samuel will discuss the related exhibition “The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking,” on view in the BGC Focus Gallery through January 27, 2013.
 
  
   
David Cohen is editor and publisher of artcritical.com as well as founder and moderator of The Review Panel.

TEMPLETON BOOK FORUM invites you to “Is the Cyber Mob a Threat to Freedom?” featuring Ron Rosenbaum, Slate, Lee Siegel, The New York Observer, moderated by Michael Goodwin, The New York Post


New Threats to Freedom


Today’s threats to freedom are “much less visible and obvious than they were in the 20th century and may even appear in the guise of social and political progress,” writes Adam Bellow in his introduction to the new essay collection that he has edited for the Templeton Press. Indeed, Bellow suggests, the danger often lies precisely in our “failure or reluctance to notice them.”


According to Ron Rosenbaum and Lee Siegel, in their provocative contributions to the volume, the extraordinary advances made possible by the Internet have come at a sometimes worrisome cost. Rosenbaum focuses on how online anonymity has become a mask encouraging political discourse that is increasingly distorted by vitriol, abuse, and</p><p>4 0.68335986 <a title="1969-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-17-The_Washington_Post_reprints_university_press_releases_without_editing_them.html">2215 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-17-The Washington Post reprints university press releases without editing them</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .  But I wonder how the profs in the psych d</p><p>5 0.64423925 <a title="1969-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-09-Frontiers_of_Science_update.html">1890 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-09-Frontiers of Science update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.  As I  wrote last month , I respe</p><p>6 0.63325822 <a title="1969-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-A_new_idea_for_a_science_core_course_based_entirely_on_computer_simulation.html">516 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-A new idea for a science core course based entirely on computer simulation</a></p>

 Learning to Read All Over Again  
Lutz Koepnick 
What produces better students – reading in print or reading on-line? The answer is both.


 The Elusive Quest for Research Innovation  
Claude S. Fischer 
Much of what is considered “new research” has actually been around for a while. But that does not mean it lacks value.


 Science Journalism and the Art of Expressing Uncertainty  
Andrew Gelman 
It is all too easy for unsupported claims to get published in scientific publications. How can journalists address this?


 A Scientist Goes Rogue  
Euny Hong 
Can social media and crowdfunding sustain independent researchers?


 Still Waiting for Change  
Sylvia A. Allegretto 
Economists and policymakers alike are ignoring a huge class of workers whose wages have been effectively frozen for decades.

<p>Introduction: David Schminovich points me to  this paper  by Yu Lu, H. Mo, Martin Weinberg, and Neal Katz:
  
We believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape the observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions. The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. . . .
  
And here’s  another  from the same authors, this time on “Bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the K-band luminosity function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation.”

<p>Introduction: John Horton points to  Sims ‘s  comment on Angrist and Pischke :
  
Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)
 
P.S.  I’m still miffed that this journal didn’t invite  me  to comment on that article!</p><p>4 0.89513308 <a title="1969-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_think_we_get_much_out_of_framing_politics_as_the_Tragic_Vision_vs._the_Utopian_Vision.html">1892 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-10-I don’t think we get much out of framing politics as the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision</a></p>

Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>5 0.89485395 <a title="1969-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-06-The_fractal_nature_of_scientific_revolutions.html">1709 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-06-The fractal nature of scientific revolutions</a></p>

I stumbled across your  blog entry  after googling on those terms. 


If I could comment on the closed entry [We had to shut off comments on old blog entries for reasons of spam --- ed.], I’d note: scientific revolutions are fractal; they’re also chaotic in their dynamics. Predictability when a particular scientific revolution will take hold—or be rejected—is problematic.

Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits.

<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .

<p>Introduction: Psychology is a universal science of human nature, whereas political science is centered on the study of particular historical events and trends.  Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that when a psychologist looks at politics, he presents ideas that are thought-provoking but are too general to quite work.  This is fine; political scientists can then take such ideas and try to adapt them more closely to particular circumstances.
 
The psychologist I’m thinking about here is Steven Pinker, who, in  writes  the following on the question, “Why Are States So Red and Blue?”:
  
But why do ideology and geography cluster so predictably? Why, if you know a person’s position on gay marriage, can you predict that he or she will want to increase the military budget and decrease the tax rate . . . there may also be coherent mindsets beneath the diverse opinions that hang together in right-wing and left-wing belief systems.

<p>Introduction: After I posted  this  recent comment on a blog of Steven Pinker (see also  here ), we had the following exchange.  I’m reposting it here (with Pinker’s agreement) not because we achieved any deep insights but because I thought it useful to reveal to people that so-called experts such as us are not so clear on these issues either. 
   
 AG:   I noticed your article on red and blue states and had some thoughts. . . . The short summary is that I think that your idea is interesting but that, as stated, it explains too much, in that your story is based on centuries-long history but it only fits electoral patterns since the 1980s.
 
 SP:   Though the exact alignment between red and blue states, political parties, and particular issues surely shift, I’d be surprised if the basic alignments between geography and the right-left divide, and the issues that cluster on each side of the divide, have radically changed over the past century.

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  blog discussions  a year ago, I published a review of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart,” for the journal Statistics, Politics, and Policy.  I invited Murray to publish a response, and he did so.
 
Here’s the abstract to  my review :
  
This article examines some claims made in a recent popular book of political sociology, with the intent not being to debunk any claims but rather to connect some important social and policy positions to statistical data on income, social class, and political attitudes. The thesis of Charles Murray’s book is that America’s upper and lower classes have become increasingly separate, with elites living more disciplined, orderly lives (characterized by marriage, work, and stable families) while being largely unaware of the lifestyles of the majority of Americans. I argue that some of Murray’s conclusions are sensitive to particular choices of whom to label as elite or upper-class.

<p>Introduction: The paradox of racism is that at any given moment, the racism of the day seems reasonable and very possibly true, but the racism of the past always seems so ridiculous. 
   
I’ve been thinking about this for a few months ever since receiving in the mail a new book, “A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human History,” by New York Times reporter Nicholas Wade.
 
Here’s what I wrote in my review of this book  for Slate :
  
The word “inequality” does not appear in the book’s index, but what Wade is offering is essentially a theory of economic and social inequality, explaining systematic racial differences in prosperity based on a combination of innate traits (“the disinclination to save in tribal societies is linked to a strong propensity for immediate consumption”) and genetic adaptation to political and social institutions (arguing, for example, that generations of centralized rule have effected a selection pressure for Chinese to be accepting of authority).

<p>Introduction: David Schminovich points me to  this paper  by Yu Lu, H. Mo, Martin Weinberg, and Neal Katz:
  
We believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape the observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions. The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. . . .
  
And here’s  another  from the same authors, this time on “Bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the K-band luminosity function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation.”

Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>3 0.89646876 <a title="1892-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-More_reason_to_like_Sims_besides_just_his_name.html">952 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-More reason to like Sims besides just his name</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Horton points to  Sims ‘s  comment on Angrist and Pischke :
  
Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)

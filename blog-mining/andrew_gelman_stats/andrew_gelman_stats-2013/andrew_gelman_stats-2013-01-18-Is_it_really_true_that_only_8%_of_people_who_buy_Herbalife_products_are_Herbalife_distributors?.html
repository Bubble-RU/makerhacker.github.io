</p><p>5 Here are some of my reactions (again, recall that I had not heard about this case before, and these reactions are based on the information provided to me):    I think there are some serious problems here. [sent-15, score-0.196]
</p><p>6 Generalizing from 2000 to the whole population is not a problem—as long as the sample is a representative sample, and as long as the survey responses are correct. [sent-17, score-0.175]
</p><p>7 I did not look at the details of the survey so I don’t know about the issue of representativeness. [sent-18, score-0.111]
</p><p>8 I wonder, though, exactly how they “fished” for respondents in their river sampling. [sent-19, score-0.414]
</p><p>9 It could be that they were more likely to get the sort of person who was interested in dietary supplements. [sent-20, score-0.063]
</p><p>10 However the sampling was done, I worry about the survey responses. [sent-23, score-0.193]
</p><p>11 For example (from  an article  by David Hemenway from 1997):  “The National Rifle reports 3 million dues-paying members, or about 1. [sent-25, score-0.113]
</p><p>12 In national random telephone surveys, however, 4-10% of respondents claim that they are dues-paying NRA members. [sent-27, score-0.363]
</p><p>13 Similarly, although Sports Illustrated reports that fewer than 3% of American households purchase the magazine, in national surveys 15% of respondents claim that they are current subscribers. [sent-28, score-0.723]
</p><p>14 ”  The mathematics is that if there is a small rate of error, it can show up as a large error in the estimate of a small population. [sent-29, score-0.117]
</p><p>15 So, just because 5% of respondents say they used Herbalife products in the previous three months, that doesn’t mean that 5% of respondents actually used Herbalife products in the previous three months. [sent-30, score-1.194]
</p><p>16 I assume that “distributors” buy a lot more Herbalife products than non-distributors. [sent-33, score-0.281]
</p><p>17 Hence, even if 8% of the Herbalife consumers are distributors, I’d guess that a lot more than 8% of Herbalife products are bought by distributors. [sent-34, score-0.416]
</p><p>18 ”  But that’s exactly what you’d expect of a still-active pyramid scheme, no? [sent-39, score-0.239]
</p><p>19 Existing members want new people below them on the pyramid. [sent-40, score-0.066]
</p><p>20 I’m not saying this means it  is  a pyramid scheme, but it doesn’t seem like evidence  against  the hypothesis! [sent-41, score-0.19]

I have a question regarding a randomizing constraint in my current funded electricity experiment. 


After elimination of missing data we have 110 voluntary households from a larger population (resource constraints do not allow us to have more households!). I randomly assign them to threated and non treated where the treatment variable is some ICT that allows the treated to track their electricity consumption in real tim. The ICT is made of two devices, one that is plugged on the household’s modem and the other on the electric meter. A necessary condition for being treated is that the distance between the box and the meter be below some threshold (d), the value of which is 20 meters approximately. 


50 ICTs can be installed. 
60 households will be in the control group.


But, I can only assign 6 households in the control group for whom d is less than 20. Therefore, I have only 6 households in the control group who have a counterfactual in the group of treated.</p><p>4 0.15888372 <a title="1679-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-11-Multilevel_marketing_as_a_way_of_liquidating_participants%E2%80%99_social_networks.html">2130 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-11-Multilevel marketing as a way of liquidating participants’ social networks</a></p>

An executive summary version of Ackman and Dineen’s Powerpoint analysis underscores the potential impact of DSOs [direct selling organizations] upon distributors’ networks:

 
Recruiting family members, friends, work and church acquaintances and others in their communities into a rigged game, one that is highly likely to exact financial and emotional harm on those loved and trusted by them, has an impact that cannot be repaired or recompensed with dollars alone.
 

In class discussions over the years, students have made similar conclusions, with some sharing experiences about how they no longer can socialize with relatives and friends who are members of DSOs because of the relentless pressure to buy and join.  Others continue to do part-time work as DSO members who were recruited by family.</p><p>5 0.13649902 <a title="1679-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Question_28_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1371 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Question 28 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

(Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)
  
Solution:  I was talking about the  work  of Gary Gates, combining an estimate of the percentage of gays in the population with an estimate of the probability that someone is in the military, given that he or she is gay.</p><p>5 0.80931956 <a title="1679-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-10-Estimation_from_an_out-of-date_census.html">405 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-10-Estimation from an out-of-date census</a></p>

When we estimate the number of people from a national sampling survey (such as labor force survey) using sampling weights, don’t we obtain underestimated number of people, if the country’s population is growing and the sampling frame is based on an old census data?  In countries with increasing populations, the probability of inclusion changes over time, but the weights can’t be adjusted frequently because census takes place only once every five or ten years.


I am currently working for UNICEF for a project on estimating number of out-of-school children in developing countries. The project leader is comfortable to use estimates of number of people from DHS and other surveys.  But, I am concerned that we may need to adjust the estimated number of people by the population projection, otherwise the estimates will be underestimated.


I googled around on this issue, but I could not find a right article or paper on this.

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I wrote about the importance of demographics in  political trends . Today I’d like to show you how demographics help predict financial crises.
 
Here are a few examples of countries with major crises.
  
 
 
 The working-age population in Japan  peaked in the 1995 census . 
  The 1995 Financial Crisis in Japan  
 
 
 
 
  The working-age USA population growth slows down to unprecedented levels in 2008 (see figure below) 

 

  Financial crisis of 2007-2010 . (Also, notice previous dips in 2001, 1991 and 1981, and consider the  list of recessions .) 
 
 
  China’s working-age population, age 15 to 64, has grown continuously. The labor pool will  peak in 2015  and then decline.  
  
There are more charts in  Demography and Growth  report by the Reserve Bank of Australia:
 
   
 
Wikipedia surveys  the causes of the financial crisis,  such as “liquidity shortfall in the United States banking system caused by the overvaluation of assets”. Oh my!

<p>Introduction: I only read the  review , not the book.  What puzzled me was not any  lack of self-awareness  but rather this bit:
  
The title of Mr. Rushdie’s new memoir . . . comes from the alias he assumed when British police told him back in 1989 that he needed a pseudonym: the Joseph comes from Joseph Conrad, the Anton from Anton Chekhov. The protection officers issued to him by the British government soon took to calling him “Joe,” an abbreviation he says he detested.
  
The thing that I don’t understand is why he detested the nickname.  If I were in a comparable situation, I think I’d appreciate if my security detail gave me a friendly nickname.  Then again, with the stress that Rushdie’s been under, I can imagine all sorts of personality transformations.</p><p>3 0.93657076 <a title="1679-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Computer_models_of_the_oil_spill.html">243 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Computer models of the oil spill</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>5 0.89834392 <a title="1679-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-18-%E2%80%9CHow_big_is_your_chance_of_dying_in_an_ordinary_play%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1945 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-18-“How big is your chance of dying in an ordinary play?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At first glance, that’s what I thought Tyler Cowen was  asking .
 
I assumed he was asking about the characters, not the audience, as watching a play seems like a pretty safe activity (A. Lincoln excepted).  Characters in plays die all the time.  I wonder what the chance is?  Something between 5% and 10%, I’d guess.
 
I’d guess your chance of dying (as a character) in a movie would be higher.  On the other hand, movies have lots of extras who just show up and leave; if you count them maybe the risk isn’t so high.  Perhaps the right way to do this is to weight people by screen time?
 
P.S.   The Mezzanine  aside, works of art and literature tend to focus on the dramatic moments of lives, so it makes sense that death will be overrepresented.</p><p>6 0.89281535 <a title="1679-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-05-A_cloud_with_a_silver_lining.html">1198 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-05-A cloud with a silver lining</a></p>

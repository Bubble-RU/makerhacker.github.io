<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.12999268 <a title="2091-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-31-A_data_visualization_manifesto.html">61 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-31-A data visualization manifesto</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

It made me [Kahan] start to wonder about what sorts of qualities of a technology will influence its dissemination & also about the availability of benchmarks for proliferation of various sorts of things (e.g, fads & trends, health-promoting behaviors, knowledge of a scientific discovery) that one could use to gauge how meaningful the apparent increase in rates of proliferation of these technologies has been over time.

 This  report claims that eating meat increases the risk of cancer.  I’m sure you can’t read the page but you probably can understand the graphs. Different bars represent subdivision in the amount of the particular type of meat one consumes. And each chunk is different types of meat. Left is for male right is for female.


They claim that the difference is significant, but they are clearly not!!

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, when we deal with scientists, statisticians are often put in a setting reminiscent of Arrow’s paradox, where we are asked to provide estimates that are informative and unbiased and confidence statements that are correct conditional on the data and also on the underlying true parameter. [It's not generally possible for an estimate to do all these things at the same time -- ed.]  Larry Wasserman feels that scientists are truly frequentist, and Don Rubin has told me how he feels that scientists interpret all statistical estimates Bayesianly. I have no doubt that both Larry and Don are correct. Voters want lower taxes and more services, and scientists want both Bayesian and frequency coverage; as the saying goes, everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.</p><p>2 0.96949387 <a title="2091-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Clarity_on_my_email_policy.html">503 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Clarity on my email policy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aki points us to  this discussion  from Rolf Zwaan:
  
The first massive replication project in psychology has just reached completion (several others are to follow). . . . What can we learn from the ManyLabs project? The results here show the effect sizes for the replication efforts (in green and grey) as well as the original studies (in blue). The 99% confidence intervals are for the meta-analysis of the effect size (the green dots); the studies are ordered by effect size.


 


Let’s first consider what we canNOT learn from these data. Of the 13 replication attempts (when the first four are taken together), 11 succeeded and 2 did not (in fact, at some point ManyLabs suggests that a third one, Imagined Contact also doesn’t really replicate). We cannot learn from this that the vast majority of psychological findings will replicate . . .


But even if we had an accurate estimate of the percentage of findings that replicate, how useful would that be? Rather than trying to arrive at a mo</p><p>4 0.96578962 <a title="2091-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-20-The_AAA_Tranche_of_Subprime_Science.html">2179 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-20-The AAA Tranche of Subprime Science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  our new ethics column for Chance , Eric Loken and I write about our current favorite topic:
  
One of our ongoing themes when discussing scientific ethics is the central role of statistics in recognizing and communicating uncer- 
tainty. Unfortunately, statistics—and the scientific process more generally—often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. . . .


We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages—that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty—were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a</p><p>5 0.96565205 <a title="2091-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

Originally I thought we’d get a bunch of bloggers and have a topic each week or each month and get discussions from lots of perspectives.  But it was hard to get people to keep contributing, and the blog+comments approach didn’t seem to be working as a way to get wide-ranging discussion.  I did organize a good  roundtable discussion  at one point, but it took a lot of work on my part.
 
Recently I had another idea for the blog, based on something that Kaiser Fung wrote on  three hours in the life of a statistician , along with a similar (if a bit more impressionistic)  piece  I wrote awhile back describing my experiences on a typical workday.
 
So here’s the plan.  365 of you write vignettes about your statistical lives.  Get into the nitty gritty—tell me what you do, and why you’re doing it.  I’ll collect these and then post them at the Statistics Forum, one a day</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The American Statistical Association has a blog called the Statistics Forum that I edit but haven’t been doing much with.

<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association has a blog called the Statistics Forum that I edit but haven’t been doing much with.  Originally I thought we’d get a bunch of bloggers and have a topic each week or each month and get discussions from lots of perspectives.  But it was hard to get people to keep contributing, and the blog+comments approach didn’t seem to be working as a way to get wide-ranging discussion.  I did organize a good  roundtable discussion  at one point, but it took a lot of work on my part.
 
Recently I had another idea for the blog, based on something that Kaiser Fung wrote on  three hours in the life of a statistician , along with a similar (if a bit more impressionistic)  piece  I wrote awhile back describing my experiences on a typical workday.
 
So here’s the plan.  365 of you write vignettes about your statistical lives.  Get into the nitty gritty—tell me what you do, and why you’re doing it.  I’ll collect these and then post them at the Statistics Forum, one a day</p><p>2 0.844441 <a title="1678-lsi-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-04-The_Case_for_More_False_Positives_in_Anti-doping_Testing.html">648 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-04-The Case for More False Positives in Anti-doping Testing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Martyn Plummer , the creator of the open-source, C++, graphical-model compiler  JAGS  (aka “Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), runs a forum on the JAGS site that has a very similar feel to the mail-bag posts on this blog.  Martyn answers general statistical computing questions (e.g., why slice sampling rather than Metropolis-Hastings?) and general modeling (e.g., why won’t my model converge with this prior?).
 
Here’s the link to the top-level JAGS site, and to the forum:
  
   JAGS Forum 
    JAGS Home Page 
   
The forum’s pretty active, with the stats page showing hundreds of views per day and very regular posts and answers.  Martyn’s last post was today.
 
Martyn also has a blog devoted to JAGS and other stats news:

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>2 0.98970747 <a title="1678-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-08-More_on_those_dudes_who_will_pay_your_professor_%248000_to_assign_a_book_to_your_class%2C_and_related_stories_about_small-time_sleazoids.html">329 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-08-More on those dudes who will pay your professor $8000 to assign a book to your class, and related stories about small-time sleazoids</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.

Can you post the announcement below on your blog? And, by all means, if you find heresy in my interview with Ron Wasserstein, feel free to criticize it with your readers.
  
I responded that I’m not religious, so he’ll have to look for someone else if he’s looking for findings of heresy.  I did, however, want to share his announcement:
  
The American Statistical Association has announced  a new Prize , “Causality in Statistics Education”, aimed to encourage the teaching of basic causal inference in introductory statistics courses.  


The motivations for the prize are discussed in  an interview  I [Pearl] gave to Ron Wasserstein. I hope readers of this list will participate, either by innovating new tools for teaching causation or by nominating candidates who deserve the prize.  


And speaking about education, Bryant and I [Pearl] have revised  our survey  of econometrics textbooks, and would love to hear your suggestions on how to restore causal inference to e</p><p>4 0.98423511 <a title="1678-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-14-Type_M_errors_in_the_lab.html">908 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-14-Type M errors in the lab</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>5 0.97558564 <a title="1678-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-19-Statistical_discrimination_again.html">1541 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-19-Statistical discrimination again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Johnstone writes:
  
I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?


One proposal has been to fit ‘black boxes’ into cars so more individual data can be collected, as opposed to relying heavily on aggregates.

<p>Introduction: Christian Robert points to  this  absurd patent of the Monte Carlo method (which, as Christian notes, was actually invented by Stanislaw Ulam and others in the 1940s).
 
The whole thing is pretty unreadable.  I wonder if they first wrote it as a journal article and then it got rejected everywhere, so they decided to submit it as a patent instead.
 
What’s even worse is this bit:
  
This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 0612170 and 0347408 awarded by the National Science Foundation.
  
So our tax dollars are being given to IBM so they can try to bring statistics to a halt by patenting one of our most basic tools?  I’d say this is just a waste of money, but given that our country is run by lawyers, there must be some outside chance that this patent could actually succeed?

I know you commented before about patents on statistical methods. Did you know this patent ( http://www.archpatent.com/patents/8032473 )? Do you have any comment on patents that don’t describe mathematically how it works and how and if they’re any different from previous methods? And what about the lack of scientific validation of the claims in such a method?

  
The patent in question, “US 8032473: “Generalized reduced error logistic regression method,” begins with the following “claim”:
  

A system for machine learning comprising: a computer including a computer-readable medium having software stored thereon that, when executed by said computer, performs a method comprising the steps of being trained to learn a logistic regression match to a target class variable so to exhibit classification learning by which: an estimated error in each variable’s moment in the logistic regression be modeled and reduce</p><p>6 0.1682338 <a title="1885-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-06-Info_on_patent_trolls.html">892 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-06-Info on patent trolls</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Edward Wyatt  reports :
  
Now the Obama administration is cracking down on what many call  patent trolls , shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid . . . “The United States patent system is vital for our economic growth, job creation, and technological advance,” [Senator] Leahy said in a statement. “Unfortunately, misuse of low-quality patents through patent trolling has tarnished the system’s image.”
  
There is some opposition:
  
But some big software companies, including Microsoft, expressed dismay at some of the proposals, saying they could themselves stifle innovation.
  
Microsoft . . . patent trolls . . . hmmm, where have we heard this connection  before ?
 
There is also some support for the bill:

<p>Introduction: From “Judge Savage,” by Tim Parks:
  
That evening, Daniel called Hilary’s parents.  These people always disliked me, he knew.  He had never understood if it was a racial thing, or whether they would have disliked any partner of Hilary’s.
  
Very clever.  Parks demonstrates Daniel’s blind spot–he can’t imagine that maybe Hilary’s parents hate him because of his unpleasant personality–but does it entirely from Daniel’s perspective.  I wonder if this just came naturally to Parks, or whether he figured it out as a puzzle to solve–how to convey a blind spot from the perspective of the person looking and not noticing it–or whether Parks wasn’t thinking at all about this and it just happened.
 
Considering the character Daniel’s psychology, I’d consider the above as an example of the so-called fundamental attribution error, in that he’s attributing Hilary’s parents dislike of him to situational factors rather than to his own personality.
 
I’ll have more on “Judge Savage” later (on the topic</p><p>3 0.84799862 <a title="1885-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-06-New_words_of_1917.html">1970 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-06-New words of 1917</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I happened to come across a little book, “Current Glossary:  Words Coined Since the War.”  Here are some of them:
 
as’pi-rin, n.  A white compound used as a drug in the cure of headaches and rheumatism.
 
bob’go, n.  A kind of antelope in Africa; its meat is good for food.
 
cat’ta-lo, n.  A cross between an American bison and a cow.
 
dart, n.  A short, pointed spear-like weapon of steel dropped by airmen in attacks on the enemy.
 
free’lance, n.  A rover in literature, a writer not in the employ of one firm.
 
griz’zly bear.  A new kind of dance.
 
You get the idea.

<p>Introduction: Xian and I respond to the four discussants of our paper, “Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference.”  Here’s the abstract of  our rejoinder :
  
Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood. The present article arose from our memory of a particularly intemperate anti-Bayesian statement that appeared in Feller’s beautiful and classic book on probability theory. We felt that it was worth exploring the very extremeness of Feller’s words, along with similar anti-Bayesian remarks by others, in order to better understand the background underlying contr</p><p>6 0.82017124 <a title="1885-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-07-Bechdel_wasn%E2%80%99t_kidding.html">701 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-07-Bechdel wasn’t kidding</a></p>

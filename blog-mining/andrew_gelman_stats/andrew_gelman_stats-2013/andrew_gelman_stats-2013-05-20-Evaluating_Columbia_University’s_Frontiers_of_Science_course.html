<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

Dear Prof Gelman,


In collaboration with Frontiers in Psychology, we are organizing a Research Topic titled “Causal discovery and generalization”, hosted by Mimi Liljeholm and Marc Buehner.  As host editor, I would like to encourage you to contribute to this topic.


A brief description of the topic is provided on our homepage on the Frontiers website (section “Frontiers in Cognition”).  This is also where all articles will appear after peer-review and where participants in the topic will be able to hold relevant discussions: http://www.frontiersin.org/Cognition/researchtopics/Causal_discovery_and_generaliz/1906


Frontiers, a Swiss open-access publisher, recently partnered with Nature Publishing Group to expand its researcher-driven Open Science platform.

<p>Introduction: April Galyardt writes:
  
I’m teaching my first graduate class this semester. It’s intro stats for graduate students in the college of education. Most of the students are first year PhD students. Though, there are a number of master’s students who are primarily in-service teachers. The difficulties with teaching an undergraduate intro stats course are still present, in that mathematical preparation and phobia vary widely across the class.


I’ve been enjoying the class and the students, but I’d like your take on an issue I’ve been thinking about. How do I balance teaching the standard methods, like hypothesis testing, that these future researchers have to know because they are so standard, with discussing the problems with those methods (e.g.  p-value as a measure of sample size , and  the decline effect , not to mention multiple testing and other common mistakes).

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>3 0.8779406 <a title="1864-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-13-Student_project_competition.html">1008 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-13-Student project competition</a></p>

I [Guan] recently began a collaboration with OpenIntro, a group of volunteers from around the country (Duke, Harvard, UCLA, and U.Miami) focused on contributing to improvements in introductory statistics education. They are an active group that has a lot of energy and neat ideas.


On behalf of OpenIntro, I’d like to invite the students in your introductory statistics course to participate in a student project competition we are sponsoring this semester. Chris Barr (Assistant Professor at Harvard Biostatistics) and I are co-chairing the competition this Fall. We are hoping to highlight the excellent work that students do by hosting the two best projects from each class at OpenIntro.org and publishing the winners of a larger competition in a paperback volume with brief discussion about each project.

<p>Introduction: While visiting the education school at the University of Pennsylvania a couple months ago, I had a long conversation with Bob Boruch, a prominent researcher in the field of evidence-based education.  We shared  Fred Mosteller stories  and talked about a lot of other things too.
 
Boruch sent me an article about teaching randomized controlled trials to education students, which gave me the following idea which connects to my longstanding embarrassment (and subject of my next column on ethics, forthcoming in Chance magazine) about the lack of systematic measurement, sampling, or experimentation in our own teaching efforts.
 
Anyway, here’s my idea for experimentation in statistics teaching, an idea that I think could work particularly well in classes with education students.
 
Each class could, as part of the course, design an educational experiment to be performed on next year’s class.  Easier said than done, I know, but perhaps ed school students would be particularly motivated to do t</p><p>5 0.87135893 <a title="1864-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-Tenure_lets_you_handle_students_who_cheat.html">1028 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-Tenure lets you handle students who cheat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>6 0.86520791 <a title="1864-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-19-Grad_students%3A__Participate_in_an_online_survey_on_statistics_education.html">1813 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-19-Grad students:  Participate in an online survey on statistics education</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Mike Betancourt and I wrote a discussion for the article, Can quantum probability provide a new direction for cognitive modeling?, by Emmanuel Pothos and Jerome Busemeyer, in Behavioral and Brain Sciences.  We didn’t say much, but it was a milestone for me because, with this article, BBS became the 100th journal I’d published in.
 
Anyway, the full article with its 34 discussions just appeared  in the journal .   Here  it is.
 
What surprised me, in reading the full discussion, was how supportive the commentary was.  Given the topic of Pothos and Busemeyer’s article, I was expecting the discussions to range from gentle mockery to outright abuse.  The discussion that Mike and I wrote was moderately encouraging, and I was expecting this to fall on the extreme positive end of the spectrum.
 
Actually, though, most of the discussions were positive, and only a couple were purely negative (those would be “Quantum models of cognition as Orwellian newspeak” by Michael Lee a</p><p>2 0.98564374 <a title="1864-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-15-A_silly_paper_that_tries_to_make_fun_of_multilevel_models.html">854 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-15-A silly paper that tries to make fun of multilevel models</a></p>

I wondered what your reaction would be to  this paper  from a recent issue of European Political Science.


It came out already in March this year, so you might have seen it or even commented on it before. Is is a joke at the expense of the whole polisci discipline, a joke the Editors did not catch, or the sequel to the Sokal affair, just with quanto social science as the target? 
  
My reply:  Yes, several people pointed me to this article.  I don’t think it’s a hoax, it’s more of a joke:  the author is making the point that with fancy statistics you can discover all sorts of patterns that don’t make sense.  The implication, I believe, is that many patterns that social scientists  do  find through statistical analysis are not actually meaningful.
 
I agree with this point, which could be even more pithily stated as “correlation does not imply causation.”  I am irritated, however, by the singling out of multilevel models here, as the point could be mad</p><p>3 0.98373008 <a title="1864-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice. The breadth of vN’s work is just too m</p><p>5 0.98042428 <a title="1864-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-01-Two_Postdoc_Positions_Available_on_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Modeling.html">62 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-01-Two Postdoc Positions Available on Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Postdoc #1. Hierarchical Modeling and Computation: We are fitting hierarchical regression models with deep interactions. We’re working on new models with structured prior distributions, and this also requires advances in Bayesian computation. Applications include public opinion, climate reconstruction, and education research.
 
Postdoc #1 is funded by grants from the Department of Energy, Institute of Education Sciences, and National Science Foundation.
 
Postdoc #2. Hierarchical Modeling and Statistical Graphics: The goal of this research program is to investigate the application of the latest methods of multi-level data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem: forecasting retail sales at the individual item level. These forecasts are used to make ordering, pricing and promotions decisions which can have significant economic impact to the retail chain such that even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions, across a large retailer’s</p><p>6 0.97948098 <a title="1864-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-19-The_grasshopper_wins%2C_and_Greg_Mankiw%E2%80%99s_grandmother_would_be_%E2%80%9Cshocked_and_appalled%E2%80%9D_all_over_again.html">1728 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-19-The grasshopper wins, and Greg Mankiw’s grandmother would be “shocked and appalled” all over again</a></p>

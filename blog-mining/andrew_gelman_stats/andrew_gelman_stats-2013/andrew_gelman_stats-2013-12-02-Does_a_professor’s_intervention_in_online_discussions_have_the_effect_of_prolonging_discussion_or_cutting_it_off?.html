For the Modern Poetry course, where there’s quite a bit of activity in the forums, the instructor (Al Filreis) is interested in what the factors are that lead to discussion threads being longer or shorter. For example, he wonders whether his own (fairly frequent) interventions have the effect of prolonging discussion or cutting it off.

I’m working on a paper examining the effect of superpower alliance on a binary DV (war). I hypothesize that the size of the effect is much higher during the Cold War than it is afterwards. I’m going to run a Chow test to check whether this effect differs significantly between 1960-1989 and 1990-2007 (Scott Long also has a method using predicted probabilities), but I’d also like to show the trend graphically, and thought that your “Secret Weapon” would be useful here. I wonder if there is anything I should be concerned about when doing this with a (rare-events) logistic regression. I was thinking to graph the coefficients in 5-year periods, moving a single year at a time (1960-64, 1961-65, 1962-66, and so on), reporting the coefficient in the graph for the middle year of each 5-year range).

<p>Introduction: We had 28 class periods, so I wrote an exam with an approximate correspondence of one question per class.  Rather than dumping the exam in your lap all at once, I’ll post the questions once per day.  Then each day I’ll post the answer to yesterday’s questions.  So it will be 29 days in all.  I’ll post them to appear late in the day so as not to interfere with our main daily posts (which are currently backed up to early June).
 
The course was offered in the political science department and covered a mix of statistical and political topics.  Followers of our  recent discussion  on test questions won’t be surprised to learn that some of the questions are ambiguous.  This wasn’t on purpose.  I tried my best, but good questions are hard to write.

<p>Introduction: Don Green and Holger Kern write  on one of my  favorite topics , treatment interactions (see also  here ):
  
We [Green and Kern] present a methodology that largely automates the search for systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in large-scale experiments. We introduce a nonparametric estimator developed in statistical learning, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), to model treatment effects that vary as a function of covariates. BART has several advantages over commonly employed parametric modeling strategies, in particular its ability to automatically detect and model relevant treatment-covariate interactions in a flexible manner.


To increase the reliability and credibility of the resulting conditional treatment effect estimates, we suggest the use of a split sample design. The data are randomly divided into two equally-sized parts, with the first part used to explore treatment effect heterogeneity and the second part used to confirm the results. This approach permits a re</p><p>6 0.11720885 <a title="2120-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-05-A_locally_organized_online_BDA_course_on_G%2B_hangout%3F.html">2009 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-05-A locally organized online BDA course on G+ hangout?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Last year  we discussed  an important challenge in causal inference:  The standard advice (given in many books, including ours) for causal inference is to control for relevant pre-treatment variables as much as possible.  But, as Judea Pearl has pointed out, instruments (as in “instrumental variables”) are pre-treatment variables that we would  not  want to “control for” in a matching or regression sense.
 
At first, this seems like a minor modification, with the new recommendation being to apply instrumental variables estimation using all pre-treatment instruments, and to control for all other pre-treatment variables.  But that can’t really work as general advice.  What about weak instruments or covariates that have some instrumental aspects?
 
I asked Paul Rosenbaum for his thoughts on the matter, and he wrote the following:

In my book “Uneducated Guesses” in the chapter on value-added models, I discuss how the treatment of missing data can have a profound effect on the estimates of teacher scores. I made up how a principal might send the best students on a field trip at the beginning of the year when the ‘pre-test’ was given (and their scores would be imputed from the students who showed up) and that the bottom half of the class would have a matching field trip on the day of the post test. Everyone laughed.


But apparently someone decided to take it seriously.

The course went really well (it was a couple of years ago now). The course was run through a partnership my department has with the Ontario Fire College. Basically, firefighters can do a certificate and sometimes a degree in public administration and part of that is a course on methods. It was a small group — about 8 or so — very motivated guys (all guys). Some of them were chiefs or deputy chiefs from small towns, others captains who were doing the certificate in order to improve their chances for promotion or as a step into a broader public admin career. 


I had asked them ahead of time to bring with them whatever data they could get their hands on and that they thought would be interesting. This included response times, data on professional v voluntary firefighters, some insurance data and the like.

<p>Introduction: Peter Bergman writes:
  
is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?  I [Bergman] have a sample size of roughly 400 people, and several binary variables correlate strongly with the outcome of interest and would also define interesting subgroups for analysis.  The problem is, stratifying over all of these (five or six) variables leaves me with strata that have only 1 person in them.  I have done some background reading on whether there is a rule of thumb for the maximum number of variables to stratify.  There does not seem to be much agreement (some say there should be between N/50-N/100 strata, others say as few as possible).  In economics, the paper I looked to is here, which seems to summarize literature related to clinical trials.  In short, my question is: is it bad to have several strata with 1 person in them? Should I group these people in with another stratum?

<p>Introduction: Usually I don’t post answers to questions right away, but Mark Liberman was kind enough to answer my question  yesterday  so I think I should reciprocate.  Mark asks:
  
I’ve been playing around with data from Coursera transaction logs, for an economics course and a modern poetry course so far.


For the Modern Poetry course, where there’s quite a bit of activity in the forums, the instructor (Al Filreis) is interested in what the factors are that lead to discussion threads being longer or shorter. For example, he wonders whether his own (fairly frequent) interventions have the effect of prolonging discussion or cutting it off.


Some background explorations are  here  with the relevant stuff mostly at the end, including  this .


With respect to Al’s specific question, my thought was to look at each of his comments, each one being the nth in some sequence, and to look at the empirical probability of continuing (at all, or perhaps for at least 1,2,3,… additional turns) in those cases c</p><p>2 0.98190856 <a title="2120-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy_of_Bayes_and_non-Bayes%3A__A_dialogue_with_Deborah_Mayo.html">291 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy of Bayes and non-Bayes:  A dialogue with Deborah Mayo</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>3 0.98170888 <a title="2120-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated%3A__A_place_to_post_your_statistics_questions.html">1061 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated:  A place to post your statistics questions</a></p>

I [Rogers] am a member of an online community of statisticians where I burn a great deal of time (and a recovering cog sci researcher). Our community website is a peer-reviewed Q and A spanning stats topics ranging from applications to mathematical theory. Our online community consists of mostly university faculty, grad students and technical consultants. The answer quality is very strong and the web design is intuitive. I think you and your readers are like-minded and would be really interested in some of the topics on the site,  CrossValidated  (you may know the sister site:  stackoverflow.com ). The philosophy is purely to further knowledge for the sake of knowledge and take pride in learning.
  
I took a quick look and the site seemed like it could be useful to people.  The only thing I didn’t understand is, why doesn’t it have a search function?  (Or maybe it was there somewhere and I couldn’t find it.)

<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.
 
 Fernando:   Incentives? Impact factors? Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . .

<p>Introduction: David Backus writes:
  
 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics.  The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money.  But how do we know it’s not the reverse:  that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well.  As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true.  What I’d call the demand-side story (more spending leads to more output) is everywhere, including this piece, from the usually reliable David Leonhardt.
  
This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?

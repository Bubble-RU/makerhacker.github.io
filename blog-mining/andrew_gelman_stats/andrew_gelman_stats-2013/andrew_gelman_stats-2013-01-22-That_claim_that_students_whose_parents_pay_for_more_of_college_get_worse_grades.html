</p><p>6 So I clicked through to the study and indeed found a problem, and it’s the one you might expect if you follow this sort of thing. [sent-6, score-0.176]
</p><p>7 Hamilton regresses college grades on the amount parents spent on college, and finds a negative correlation:  more parental spending is associated with lower grades. [sent-7, score-1.135]
</p><p>8 ”  If you’re not doing so well in college but it’s being paid for, you might stay. [sent-9, score-0.285]
</p><p>9 This would induce the negative correlation in the data, but not at all through the causal story that Hamilton is telling, that students who are parentally-supported “dial down their academic efforts. [sent-11, score-0.528]
</p><p>10 You really really shouldn’t control for whether a student is working during school, if you’re trying to estimate the effect of parental support. [sent-16, score-0.72]
</p><p>11 Hamilton also performs an analysis on a different dataset including within-student comparisons when student aid varied over time. [sent-17, score-0.413]
</p><p>12 This is fine but it has the same problem that it doesn’t seem that students get counted after they drop out. [sent-18, score-0.246]
</p><p>13 Again, an observed correlation does not necessarily correspond to a causal effect—and I don’t say this in a vague “correlation does not equal causation” sense but more specifically that there’s a clear selection problem going on here (as well as a comparison conditional on intermediate outcomes). [sent-19, score-0.55]
</p><p>14 Hamilton writes, “These results provide strong evidence that selectivity processes are not driving the negative relationship between parental aid and GPA,” but I don’t see it. [sent-20, score-0.664]
</p><p>15 As a side note, I’m slightly bothered by this graph from the paper:       I mean, sure, a graph is better than a table full of numbers such as “-11. [sent-21, score-0.14]
</p><p>16 A footnote says, “The funds needed to provide parental aid can come from a variety of sources . [sent-27, score-0.686]
</p><p>17 Parents may thus offer funds that exceed income earned in a given year. [sent-30, score-0.196]
</p><p>18 And, when it does, I’d expect the impact on the student to be different from funds supplied by a richer family. [sent-32, score-0.498]
</p><p>19 I can’t imagine it feels so much like free money to a student if parents are paying more for college than they (the parents) make in a year. [sent-33, score-0.972]
</p><p>20 I’m surprised the reviewers for the American Sociological Review didn’t catch these problems, which are pretty standard issues in causal inference:  survivorship bias and controlling for intermediate variables. [sent-35, score-0.401]

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.

In the 1930s, the average GPA at American colleges and universities was about 2.35, a number that corresponds with data compiled by W. Perry in 1943. By the 1950s, the average GPA was about 2.52. GPAs took off in the 1960s with grades at private schools rising faster than public schools, lulled in the 1970s, and began to rise again in the 1980s at a rate of about 0.10 to 0.15 increase in GPA per decade. The grade inflation that began in the 1980s has yet to end. . . . These trends may help explain why private school students are disproportionately represented in Ph.D. study in science and engineering and why they tend to dominate admission into the most prestigious professional schools.

<p>Introduction: I received the following question from an education researcher:
  
 
I was wondering if I could ask you a question about an HLM model I’m working on.  The basic design is that we have 5 years of 8th grade student achievement data (standardized test scores, this is the dependent variable), 4th grade test scores, demographics (e.g., gender and ethnicity) and status wrt special ed or ELL, etc..  In addition, we have some school- or second-level information such as school averages of the student information, type of school (grade configuration), enrollment and so.  In total there are thousands of students and many schools over the 5 years of information.


The model we’re using is quite parsimonious, using only 7 student-level effects and 4 school-level effects.   What’s puzzling us is that the correlation between predicted and actual is unrealistically high…r=0.999.   We’re using the HPMIXED procedure in SAS but that shouldn’t matter.  By dropping variables, obviously we can get the corre</p><p>5 0.15696067 <a title="1688-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-07-Pay_for_an_A%3F.html">71 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-07-Pay for an A?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judah Guber writes about his  new company :
  
What we have done with Ultrinsic is created a system of incentives for students to allow them to invest in their ability to achieve a certain grade and when they achieve that grade we reward them with a cash incentive on top of receiving their original investment. This helps remove one of the large barriers students have to studying and staying motivated over the course of long semesters of college by giving them rewards on a much more immediate basis.


We have been doing a pilot program in 2 schools, NYU and Penn, for the past year or so, and are currently in the process of a major roll out of our services to 37 schools all across the country. This is due to our popularity and inquiries from students in tons of schools all around the country regarding getting Ultrinsic’s services in their school. In the Fall 2010 semester, Ultrinsic will be revolutionizing student motivation on a grand scale .

<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>4 0.81879562 <a title="1688-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Why_girls_do_better_in_school.html">1803 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Why girls do better in school</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls. In every subject area, bo</p><p>5 0.81695175 <a title="1688-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-My_proposal_for_making_college_admissions_fairer.html">93 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-My proposal for making college admissions fairer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.
 
2.  Subtract points for taking the SAT multiple times.  A simple rule would be:  You can use your highest SAT score, but you lose 50 points for every other time</p><p>6 0.81401205 <a title="1688-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-07-Pay_for_an_A%3F.html">71 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-07-Pay for an A?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone just stopped by and dropped off a copy of the book Wizardry:  Baseball’s All-time Greatest Fielders Revealed, by Michael Humphreys.  I don’t have much to say about the topic–I did see Brooks Robinson play, but I don’t remember any fancy plays.  I must have seen Mark Belanger but I don’t really recall.  Ozzie Smith was cool but I saw only him on TV.  The most impressive thing I ever saw live was Rickey Henderson stealing a base.  The best thing about that was that everyone was expecting him to steal the base, and he still was able to do it.  But that wasn’t fielding either.
 
Anyway, Humphreys was nice enough to give me a copy of his book, and since I can’t say much (I didn’t have it in me to study the formulas in detail, nor do I know enough to be able to evaluate them), I might as well say what I can say right away.
 
(Note:  Humphreys replies to some of these questions in  a comment .)

<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

<p>Introduction: Theodore Vasiloudis writes:
  
I came upon  this article  by Laura Hamilton, an assistant professor in the University of California at Merced, that claims that “The more money that parents provide for higher education, the lower the grades their children earn.”


I can’t help but feel that there something wrong with the basis of the study or a confounding factor causing this apparent correlation, and since you often comment on studies on your blog I thought you might find this study interesting.
  
My reply:  I have to admit that the description above made me suspicious of the study before I even looked at it.  On first thought, I’d expect the effect of parent’s financial contributions to be positive (as they free the student from the need to get a job during college), but not negative.  Hamilton argues that “parental investments create a disincentive for student achievement,” which may be—but I’m generally suspicious of arguments in which the rebound is bigger than the main effect.</p><p>4 0.96432674 <a title="1688-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-More_consulting_experiences%2C_this_time_in_computational_linguistics.html">1596 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-More consulting experiences, this time in computational linguistics</a></p>

I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals.

<p>Introduction: The other day I  posted  some remarks on Stan Liebowitz’s analysis of coauthorship in economics.  Liebowitz followed up with some more thoughts:
  
I [Liebowitz] am not arguing for an increase or decrease in coauthorship, per se. I would prefer an efficient amount of coauthorship, whatever that is, and certainly it will vary by paper and by field. If you feel you are more productive with many coauthors, that is not in contrast to anything in my paper. My point is that you will pick the correct number of coauthors if you and your coauthors are given 1/n credit (assuming you believe each author contributed equally). If, however, all of the coauthors are given full credit for the paper (and I have evidence that, in economics at least, authors are far more likely to receive full credit than 1/n credit), authors will get credit for more papers if they use more coauthors than would otherwise be best for total research productivity. My criticism is in the inefficiency induced by not using 1/n</p><p>6 0.96285099 <a title="1688-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-Some_thoughts_on_academic_cheating%2C_inspired_by_Frey%2C_Wegman%2C_Fischer%2C_Hauser%2C_Stapel.html">901 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-Some thoughts on academic cheating, inspired by Frey, Wegman, Fischer, Hauser, Stapel</a></p>

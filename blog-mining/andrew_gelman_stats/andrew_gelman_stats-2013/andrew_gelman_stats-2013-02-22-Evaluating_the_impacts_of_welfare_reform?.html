I saw  a post  on Andrew Sullivan’s blog today about life expectancy in different US counties. With a bunch of the worst counties being in Mississippi, I thought that it might be another case of analysts getting extreme values from small counties.


However, the paper (see  here ) includes a pretty interesting methods section. This is from page 5, “Specifically, we used a mixed-effects Poisson regression with time, geospatial, and covariate components. Poisson regression fits count outcome variables, e.g., death counts, and is preferable to a logistic model because the latter is biased when an outcome is rare (occurring in less than 1% of observations).”


They have downloadable data. I believe that the data are predicted values from the model. A web appendix also gives 90% CIs for their estimates.


Do you think they solved the small county problem and that the worst counties really are where their spreadsheet suggests?

<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>5 0.13764775 <a title="1732-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-21-Everything_I_need_to_know_about_Bayesian_statistics%2C_I_learned_in_eight_schools..html">2180 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-21-Everything I need to know about Bayesian statistics, I learned in eight schools.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I’m aware that there  are  some people who use a Bayesian approach largely because it allows them to provide a highly informative prior distribution based subjective judgment, but that is not the appeal of Bayesian methods for a lot of us practitioners. It’s disappointing and surprising, twenty years after my initial experiences, to still hear highly informed professional statisticians who think that what distinguishes Bayesian statistics from Frequentist statistics is “subjectivity” ( as seen in  a recent blog post and its comments ).
 
 My first encounter with Bayesian statistics was just over 20 years ago. I was a postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a new PhD in theoretical atomic physics but working on various problems related to the geographical and statistical distribution of indoor radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be dangerous if present at high concentrations).

Your blog has skirted around the value of observational studies and chided folks for using causal language when they only have associations but I sense that you ultimately find value in these associations. I would love for you to expand this thought in a blog. Specifically:


Does a measured association “suggest” a causal relationship? Are measured associations a good and efficient way to narrow the field of things that should be studied? Of all the things we should pursue, should we start with the stuff that has some largish measured association? Certainly many associations are not directly causal but due to joint association. Similarly, there must be many variables that are directly causally associated ( A -> B) but the effect, measured as an association, is masked by confounders. So if we took the “measured associations are worthwhile” approach, we’d never or rarely find the masked effects.

<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.  Computer science student Elias Bareinboim gave the following example:  “suppose we know nothing a</p><p>5 0.79040527 <a title="1732-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical.

<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.

I was recently in a conversation with some colleagues regarding the evaluation of recent welfare reform in California. The discussion centered around what types of design might allow us to understand the impact the changes. Experimental designs were out, as random assignment is not feasible. Our data is pre/post, and some of my colleagues believed that the best we can do under these circumstance was a descriptive study; i.e. no causal inference. All of us were concerned with changes in economic and population changes over the pre-to-post period; i.e. over-estimating the effects in an improving economy. 


I was thought a quasi-experimental design was possible using MLM. Briefly, my suggestion was the following:


Match our post-participants to a set of pre-participants on relevant person level factors, and treat the pre/post differences as a random effect at the county level.

Why do some innovations spread so swiftly and others so slowly? Consider the very different trajectories of surgical anesthesia and antiseptics, both of which were discovered in the nineteenth century. The first public demonstration of anesthesia was in 1846. The Boston surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow was approached by a local dentist named William Morton, who insisted that he had found a gas that could render patients insensible to the pain of surgery. That was a dramatic claim. In those days, even a minor tooth extraction was excruciating. Without effective pain control, surgeons learned to work with slashing speed. Attendants pinned patients down as they screamed and thrashed, until they fainted from the agony. Nothing ever tried had made much difference. Nonetheless, Bigelow agreed to let Morton demonstrate his claim.


On October 16, 1846, at Massachusetts General Hospital, Morton administered his gas through an inhaler in</p><p>4 0.98691094 <a title="1732-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-30-Infill_asymptotics_and_sprawl_asymptotics.html">1877 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-30-Infill asymptotics and sprawl asymptotics</a></p>

Penalized regression methods, such as L1 regularization, are routinely used in high-dimensional applications, and there is a rich literature on optimality properties under sparsity assumptions. In the Bayesian paradigm, sparsity is routinely induced through two-component mixture priors having a probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunting computational problems in high dimensions. This has motivated an amazing variety of continuous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale mixtures of Gaussians, facilitating computation. In sharp contrast to the corresponding frequentist literature, very little is known about the properties of such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide precise results on prior and posterior concentration. Interestingly, we demonstrate that most commonly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian Lasso, are suboptimal in hig</p><p>5 0.98304933 <a title="1732-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Term_Limits_for_the_Supreme_Court%3F.html">235 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Term Limits for the Supreme Court?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.

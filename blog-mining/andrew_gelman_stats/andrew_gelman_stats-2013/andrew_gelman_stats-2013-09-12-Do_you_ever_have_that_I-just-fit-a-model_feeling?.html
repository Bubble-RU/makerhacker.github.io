<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Psychologists perform experiments on Canadian undergraduate psychology students and draws conclusions that (they believe) apply to humans in general; they publish in Science. A drug company decides to embark on additional trials that will cost tens of millions of dollars based on the results of a careful double-blind study….whose patients are all volunteers from two hospitals. A movie studio holds 9 screenings of a new movie for volunteer viewers and, based on their survey responses, decides to spend another $8 million to re-shoot the ending.  A researcher interested in the effect of ventilation on worker performance conducts a months-long study in which ventilation levels are varied and worker performance is monitored…in a single building.
 
In almost all fields of research, most studies are based on convenience samples, or on random samples from a larger population that is itself a convenience sample. The paragraph above gives just a few examples.  The benefit</p><p>3 0.11278563 <a title="2018-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-07-Reproducible_science_FAIL_%28so_far%29%3A__What%E2%80%99s_stoppin_people_from_sharin_data_and_code%3F.html">1447 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-07-Reproducible science FAIL (so far):  What’s stoppin people from sharin data and code?</a></p>

Your  recent post  on sharing data was of great interest to me, as my own research in computer science asks how to incentivize and lower barriers to data sharing.   I was particularly curious about your highlighting of effort as the major dis-incentive to sharing.  I would love to hear more, as this question of effort is on we specifically target in our development of tools for data authoring and publishing.


As a straw man, let me point out that sharing data technically requires no more than posting an excel spreadsheet online.  And that you likely already produced that spreadsheet during your own analytic work.   So, in what way does such low-tech publishing fail to meet your data sharing objectives?


Our own hypothesis has been that the effort is really quite low, with the problem being a lack of *immediate/tangible* benefits (as opposed to the long-term values you accurately describe).

<p>Introduction: AT  discusses  [link broken; see P.P.S. below] a new paper of his that casts doubt on the robustness of the  controversial  Christakis and Fowler papers.  AT writes that he ran some simulations of contagion on social networks and found that (a) in a simple model assuming the contagion of the sort hypothesized by Christakis and Fowler, their procedure would indeed give the sorts of estimates they found in their papers, but (b) in another simple model assuming a different sort of contagion, the C&F; estimation would give indistinguishable estimates.  Thus, if you believe AT’s simulation model, C&F;’s procedure cannot statistically distinguish between two sorts of contagion (directional and simultaneous).
 
I have not looked at AT’s paper so I can’t fully comment, but I don’t fully understand his method for simulating network connections.  AT uses what he calls a “rewiring” model.

While reading your  postings  [or  here ] on the subject of testing your model by running fake data I was reminded of the fact that I got one of these kinds of tests actually published in a GAO report back in the day.  Reading your posts on Unz and  political vs. economic discourse  made me think of that work again.  I thought I’d actually drop you a line on the subject.


Back in 2003 GAO was asked to look at Farmer Mac, including a look at the Farm Credit Agency’s regulation of Farmer Mac.  As the resident mortgage econometrician back then I was asked to look at FCA’s risk based capital stress test for Farmer Mac.  The work was pretty easy.  I found a lot of oddities, but the biggest one was that they were using a discrete choice set up (loan goes bad or doesn’t) instead of a hazard model (loan goes bad this period or survives to the next).  Not necessarily a problem – lots of mortgage models run that way.

<p>Introduction: For the past few weeks I’ve been in pain much of the time, some sort of spasms in my neck and shoulder.  Things are mostly better now, but last night I woke up at 5am and my neck was killing me.  On the upside, I’d just been having a dream about multiple imputation and in the dream I had a brilliant idea of how to reconcile conditional and joint model specifications.  Amazingly enough, when I awoke, I remembered the idea from the dream, and, even more amazingly, it really was a good idea.  And, I was in pain and couldn’t fall back asleep.  That was good news because that meant I didn’t forget the idea.  I mentioned it to Jingchen in our midday meeting today and he didn’t shoot it down.
 
At this point, I don’t really know what will happen.  Sometimes I have a sudden inspiration and is works out  just as planned  or even  better than anticipated ; other times, what seems like a brilliant plan goes nowhere.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  quotes  Bentley University economics professor Scott Sumner  writing  on the first anniversary of his blog:
  
Be careful what you wish for.  Last February 2nd I [Sumner] started this blog with very low expectations… I knew I wasn’t a good writer . . . And I was also pretty sure that the content was not of much interest to anyone.


Now my biggest problem is time–I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the blog, seven days a week.  Several hours are spent responding to reader comments and the rest is spent writing long-winded posts and checking other economics blogs. . . .


I [Sumner] don’t think much of the official methodology in macroeconomics.  Many of my fellow economists seem to have a Popperian view of the social sciences.  You develop a model.  You go out and get some data.  And then you try to refute the model with some sort of regression analysis. . . .


My problem with this view is that it doesn’t reflect the way macro and finance actually work.

Here’s something I’ve been wondering for a while, and I thought your blog might be the right place to get the views from a wider group, too. How would you describe that feeling when—after going through the theory, collecting data, specifying the model, perhaps debugging the code—you hit enter and get the first results (of a new study) on your screen?


I find this quite an exciting moment in research, somehow akin making a (silly) bet with a friend, but at the same time more serious as I’m wagering (part) of my view how the world functions.


Anyhow, I thought it could be interesting to hear from others how they feel in that moment.
  
For me it’s often an anticlimax, in that once I’ve gone through all the effort to successfully fit a model, then I have to go through another long set of steps to understand what I have in front of me.  Every once in awhile the results just jump out and are exciting, but usually it takes a lot of work to see what I’m looking for.</p><p>2 0.95524114 <a title="2018-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-15-How_effective_are_football_coaches%3F.html">1804 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-15-How effective are football coaches?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>3 0.95306486 <a title="2018-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-07-Cause_he_thinks_he%E2%80%99s_so-phisticated.html">2323 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-07-Cause he thinks he’s so-phisticated</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story  (“Yale tells students to keep Kissinger talk secret . . . ‘Dr. Kissinger’s visit to campus will not be publicized, so we appreciate your confidentiality…’”) reminds me of two things:
 
- In the 1980s, I once went to a public lecture at Harvard by Kissinger protogé Ted Koppel, who indeed has that deep Ted Koppel voice even when he’s just chatting (as I overheard).  Koppel insisted that the contents of his talk not be reported.  It was no great loss; he didn’t really have anything newsworthy to say.  The talk was fine, he told us some interesting things, just nothing that would’ve made the news or even the campus newspaper.  Still, it seemed kinda tacky for a reporter whose shtick was access to the powerful, to not want his own speech to be reported. 
 
- In the 1990s, a colleague of mine in a different dept told us that this professor from another university was coming by to give a lecture.  I told my colleague that I’d like to meet with the guy, as I wanted to ask his opin</p><p>4 0.95035356 <a title="2018-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding_the_p-value.html">1760 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding the p-value</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The New York Times has a feature in its Tuesday science section, Take a Number, to which I occasionally contribute (see  here  and  here ).
 
Today’s  column , by Nicholas Balakar, is in error.  The column begins:
  
When medical researchers report their findings, they need to know whether their result is a real effect of what they are testing, or just a random occurrence. To figure this out, they most commonly use the p-value.
  
This is wrong on two counts.  First, whatever researchers might feel, this is something they’ll never know.  Second, results are a combination of real effects and chance, it’s not either/or.
 
Perhaps the above is a forgivable simplification, but I don’t think so; I think it’s a simplification that destroys the reason for writing the article in the first place.  But in any case I think there’s no excuse for this, later on:
  
By convention, a p-value higher than 0.05 usually indicates that the results of the study, however good or bad, were probably due only</p><p>5 0.95013547 <a title="2018-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-29-Ya_don%E2%80%99t_know_Bayes%2C_Jack.html">117 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-29-Ya don’t know Bayes, Jack</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.  It’s just that he’s fighting against a bu</p><p>6 0.94886756 <a title="2018-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-20-A_kaleidoscope_of_responses_to_Dubner%E2%80%99s_criticisms_of_our_criticisms_of_Freaknomics.html">1223 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-20-A kaleidoscope of responses to Dubner’s criticisms of our criticisms of Freaknomics</a></p>

[sent-26, score-0.464]
</p><p>2 Here are some important contributions that come to mind (in no particular order):  bootstrap, lasso, generalized estimating equations (I actually hate that stuff but it’s undeniably had lots of inference), false discovery rates (ditto), multiple imputation, various methods in imaging. [sent-28, score-0.398]
</p><p>3 It’s hard for me to single out a particular contribution here, but I’m thinking of the cluster of papers from about 1970 to 1980 where a bunch of researchers demonstrated that multilevel models can work in a general way in many different application areas. [sent-30, score-0.444]
</p><p>4 Various theoretical ideas, I suppose, although it’s hard for me to weigh the importance of these, as compared with methods and applications. [sent-37, score-0.268]
</p><p>5 Another example would be the work of Berger and others on Lindley’s paradox:  I think this work would have to be included because it is so influential and has affected practice as well, even though it did not directly lead to any model or method. [sent-39, score-0.342]
</p><p>6 I’ll let others judge what is the most important work in that area. [sent-41, score-0.382]
</p><p>7 It’s tough to pinpoint any particular work in this area as representing a key contribution. [sent-44, score-0.262]
</p><p>8 This work changed the face of statistics but I’d feel uncomfortable giving an award for a set of methods that nobody ever actually uses, or should use. [sent-49, score-0.501]
</p><p>9 Should preference be given to ideas such as slice sampling that seem to stand alone as unique contributions? [sent-55, score-0.322]
</p><p>10 Or does it make more sense to give awards to general areas such as tempering and multigrid methods that have been hammered out by dozens of computational physicists working on lots of problems? [sent-56, score-0.601]
</p><p>11 From the standpoint of statistical computing it’s really nothing special compared to stuff that physicists were doing in the 1940s. [sent-58, score-0.245]
</p><p>12 The central application areas of statistics are survey sampling and causal inference. [sent-63, score-0.479]
</p><p>13 It’s not difficult to find examples of theoretical work (for example, by Rubin, Imbens, and Pearl) making fundamental contributions to causal inference, but I think applied work in the area deserves a prize too, perhaps the work of Greenland and Robins. [sent-66, score-1.278]
</p><p>14 It could be difficult to pick out a single applied paper but the body of work is important. [sent-67, score-0.417]
</p><p>15 Just as, in biology, the development of a useful lab technique can have important scientific implications, similarly, in statistics, a series of successful applications can lead the way to important methodological developments. [sent-68, score-0.24]
</p><p>16 The big thing here is Mister P (or so I think), and, again, progress has been slow, starting with work on small-area estimation in the 1970s and then continuing through the 1990s and today with a gradual integration of model-based and design-based approaches. [sent-70, score-0.315]
</p><p>17 Experimental design is another hugely important topic in statistics but I don’t know if there have been any really important contributions in this area by researchers who are still alive. [sent-72, score-0.657]
</p><p>18 I think if experimental design as an old, classical topic (and a topic that’s important enough that it continues to be rediscovered by outsiders), but that might just be my own ignorance. [sent-73, score-0.294]
</p><p>19 To go in an entirely different direction:  I’m not sure how to consider work that’s tied to specific application areas. [sent-74, score-0.364]
</p><p>20 Finally, I suspect there are some big ideas I’ve missed, either because I forgot them or just because there are big areas of statistics that I don’t know much about. [sent-84, score-0.551]

<p>Introduction: Catherine Rampell  writes :
  
On Monday the Nobel Foundation, which bestows the world’s most prestigious academic, literary and humanitarian prizes, said it was reducing the cash awarded with Nobel Prizes by about 20 percent. . . .


Peter A. Diamond, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also received the Nobel in economic science in 2010, observed that over the long run, cutting the cash award could dilute the prize’s prestige.


But he added that Monday’s news overstates the financial blow to future laureates. “One of the things that comes with the prize, besides the prestige and the money,” he said, “is the opportunities to make more money.”
  
I wouldn’t think these guys need the money, but I suppose it’s part of their professional code that they have to say that?  (Recall our earlier  discussion  of the economist who said he’d stop working once his marginal tax rate reached the anticipated value of 93%.)</p><p>3 0.17311253 <a title="2151-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m postponing today’s scheduled post (“Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models”) to continue the lively discussion from yesterday,  What if I were to stop publishing in journals? . 
   
 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Christian Robert is  planning  a graduate seminar in which students read 15 classic articles of statistics.  (See  here  for more details and a slightly different list.)
 
Actually, he just writes “classics,” but based on his list, I assume he only wants articles, not books.  If he wanted to include classic books, I’d nominate the following, just for starters: 
- Fisher’s Statistical Methods for Research Workers 
- Snedecor and Cochran’s Statistical Methods 
- Kish’s Survey Sampling 
- Box, Hunter, and Hunter’s Statistics for Experimenters 
- Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Cleveland’s The Elements of Graphing Data 
- Mosteller and Wallace’s book on the Federalist Papers. 
Probably Cox and Hinkley, too.  That’s a book that I don’t think has aged well, but it seems to have had a big influence.
 
I think there’s a lot more good and accessible material in these classic books than in the equivalent volume of classic articles.  Journal articles can be difficult to read and are typicall</p><p>6 0.14600618 <a title="2151-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-09-A_tale_of_two_discussion_papers.html">1848 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-09-A tale of two discussion papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was asked to write an article for the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) 50th anniversary volume.   Here it is  (it’s labeled as “Chapter 1,” which isn’t right; that’s just what came out when I used the template that was supplied).  The article begins as follows:
  
The field of statistics continues to be divided into competing schools of thought. In theory one might imagine choosing the uniquely best method for each problem as it arises, but in practice we choose for ourselves (and recom- mend to others) default principles, models, and methods to be used in a wide variety of settings. This article briefly considers the informal criteria we use to decide what methods to use and what principles to apply in statistics problems.
  
And then I follow up with these sections:
  
Statistics: the science of defaults


Ways of knowing

<p>Introduction: For the past several months I’ve been circling around and around some questions related to the issue of how we build trust in statistical methods and statistical results.  There are lots of examples but let me start with my own career.  My most cited publications are my books and my methods papers, but I think that much of my credibility as a statistical researcher comes from my applied work.  It somehow matters, I think, when judging my statistical work, that I’ve done (and continue to do) real research in social and environmental science.
 
Why is this?  It’s not just that my applied work gives me good examples for my textbooks.  It’s also that the applied work motivated the new methods.  Most of the successful theory and methods that my collaborators and I have developed, we developed in the context of trying to solve active applied problems.  We weren’t trying to shave a half a point off the predictive error in the Boston housing data; rather, we were attacking new problems that we</p><p>4 0.81430131 <a title="2151-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-19-David_Blackwell.html">155 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-19-David Blackwell</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Blackwell was already retired by the time I came to Berkeley, and probably our closest connection was that I taught the class in decision theory that he used to teach.  I enjoyed that class a lot, partly because it took me out of my usual comfort zone of statistical inference and data analysis toward something more theoretical and mathematical.  Blackwell was one of the legendary figures in the department at that time and was also one of the most tolerant of alternative approaches to statistics, perhaps because of combination of a mathematical background, applied research in the war and after (which I learned about in  this recent obituary ), and personal experiences,
 
Blackwell may be best known in statistics for the  Rao-Blackwell theorem .  Rao, of course, is also famoust for the Cramer-Rao lower bound.  Both theorems relate to minimum-variance statistical estimators.

<p>Introduction: Sociologist Fabio Rojas  reports  on “a conversation I [Rojas] have had a few times with statisticians”:
  
Rojas:  “What does your research tell us about a sample of, say, a few hundred cases?”


Statistician: “That’s not important. My result works as n–> 00.”


Rojas: “Sure, that’s a fine mathematical result, but I have to estimate the model with, like, totally finite data. I need inference, not limits. Maybe the estimate doesn’t work out so well for small n.”


Statistician: “Sure, but if you have a few million cases, it’ll work in the limit.”


Rojas: “Whoa. Have you ever collected, like, real world network data? A million cases is hard to get.”
  
The conversation continues in this frustrating vein.  Rojas writes:
  
This illustrates a fundamental issue in statistics (and other sciences). One you formalize a model and work mathematically, you are tempted to focus on what is mathematically interesting instead of the underlying problem motivating the science. . . .

<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>2 0.98156655 <a title="2151-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-20-Do_differences_between_biology_and_statistics_explain_some_of_our_diverging_attitudes_regarding_criticism_and_replication_of_scientific_claims%3F.html">2218 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-20-Do differences between biology and statistics explain some of our diverging attitudes regarding criticism and replication of scientific claims?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last month we discussed an opinion piece by Mina Bissell, a nationally-recognized leader in cancer biology.  Bissell argued that there was too much of a push to replicate scientific findings.  I  disagreed , arguing that scientists should  want  others to be able to replicate their research, that it’s in everyone’s interest if replication can be done as fast and reliably as possible, and that if a published finding cannot be easily replicated, this is at best a failure of communication (in that the conditions for successful replication have not clearly been expressed), or possibly a fragile finding (that is, a phenomenon that appears under some conditions but not others), or at worst a plain old mistake (possibly associated with lab error or maybe with statistical error of some sort, such as jumping to certainty based on a statistically significant claim that arose from  multiple comparisons ).
 
So we disagreed.  Fair enough.

<p>Introduction: Ta-Nehisi Coates recently published  a fascinating column  on the “culture of poverty,” in particular focusing on the idea that behavior that is rational and adaptive in some settings is not so appropriate in others:
  
The set of practices required for a young man to secure his safety on the streets of his troubled neighborhood are not the same as those required to place him on an honor roll . . . The way to guide him through this transition is not to insult his native language. . . .


For black men like us, the feeling of having something to lose, beyond honor and face, is foreign. We grew up in communities—New York, Baltimore, Chicago—where the Code of the Streets was the first code we learned. Respect and reputation are everything there. These values are often denigrated by people who have never been punched in the face. But when you live around violence there is no opting out. A reputation for meeting violence with violence is a shield. That protection increases when you are part</p><p>4 0.97824377 <a title="2151-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:


1) When building a track record and scientific rep</p><p>5 0.97779441 <a title="2151-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-17-Replication_backlash.html">2137 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-17-Replication backlash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Raghuveer Parthasarathy pointed me to an article in Nature by Mina Bissell, who  writes , “The push to replicate findings could shelve promising research and unfairly damage the reputations of careful, meticulous scientists.”
 
I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

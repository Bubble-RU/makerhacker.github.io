<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: Some thoughts  from Mark Palko:
  
Of all the subjects a student is likely to encounter after elementary school, mathematics is by far the easiest to teach yourself. . . . 


What is it that makes math teachers so expendable? . . .


At some point all disciplines require the transition from passive to active and that transition can be challenging. In courses like high school history and science, the emphasis on passively acquiring knowledge (yes, I realize that students write essays in history classes and apply formulas in science classes but that represents a relatively small portion of their time and, more importantly, the work those students do is fundamentally different from the day-to-day work done by historians and scientists). By comparison, junior high students playing in an orchestra, writing short stories or solving math problems are almost entirely focused on processes and those processes are essentially the same as those engaged in by professional musicians, writers and mat</p><p>5 0.10349887 <a title="1843-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-28-New_book_by_Stef_van_Buuren_on_missing-data_imputation_looks_really_good%21.html">1642 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-28-New book by Stef van Buuren on missing-data imputation looks really good!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben points us to a new book,  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data .  It’s excellent and I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth the $89.95.  Van Buuren’s book is great even if you don’t end up using the algorithm described in the book (I actually like their approach but I do think there are some limitations with their particular implementation, which is one reason we’re developing our own  package ); he supplies lots of intuition, examples, and graphs. 
   
P.S.  Stef’s book features an introduction by Don Rubin, which gets me thinking:  if Don can find the time to write an introduction to somebody else’s book, he surely should be willing to read and comment on the third edition of his own book, no?</p><p>6 0.10095491 <a title="1843-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Dodging_the_diplomats.html">232 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Dodging the diplomats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was stunned  this  from Jenny Davidson about mystery writers:
  
The crime fiction community is smart and adult and welcoming, and so many good books are being written (Lee Child was mentioning his peer group – i.e. they were the new kids around the same tie – being Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman – the list speaks for itself) . . .
  
Why was I stunned?  Because just a few days earlier I had a look at a book by Robert Crais.  It just happened that Phil, when he was visiting, had finished this book (which he described as “pretty good”) and left it with me so he wouldn’t have to take it back with him.  I’d never heard of Crais, but it had pretty amazing blurbs on the cover and Phil recommended it, so I took a look.
 
It was bad.  From page 1 it was bad.  It was like a bad cop show.  I could see the seams where the sentences were stitched together.  I could see how  somebody  might like this sort of book, but I certainly can’t understand the blurbs or the i</p><p>3 0.84113228 <a title="1843-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-28-New_book_by_Stef_van_Buuren_on_missing-data_imputation_looks_really_good%21.html">1642 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-28-New book by Stef van Buuren on missing-data imputation looks really good!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I happened to come across a little book, “Current Glossary:  Words Coined Since the War.”  Here are some of them:
 
as’pi-rin, n.  A white compound used as a drug in the cure of headaches and rheumatism.
 
bob’go, n.  A kind of antelope in Africa; its meat is good for food.
 
cat’ta-lo, n.  A cross between an American bison and a cow.
 
dart, n.  A short, pointed spear-like weapon of steel dropped by airmen in attacks on the enemy.
 
free’lance, n.  A rover in literature, a writer not in the employ of one firm.
 
griz’zly bear.  A new kind of dance.
 
You get the idea.

<p>Introduction: I used to think that fiction is about making up stories, but in recent years I’ve decided that fiction is really more of a method of telling true stories.  One thing fiction allows you to do is explore what-if scenarios.  I recently read two books that made me think about this:  The Counterlife by Philip Roth and Things We Didn’t See Coming by Steven Amsterdam.  Both books are explicitly about contingencies and possibilities:  Roth’s tells a sequence of related but contradictory stories involving his Philip Roth-like (of course) protagonist, and Amsterdam’s is based on an alternative present/future.  (I picture Amsterdam’s book as being set in Australia, but maybe I’m just imagining this based on my knowledge that the book was written and published in that country.)  I found both books fascinating, partly because of the characters’ voices but especially because they both seemed to exemplify George Box’s dictum that to understand a system you have to perturb it.

<p>Introduction: This was an good idea:  take a bunch of old (and some recent) news articles on developments in mathematics and related ares from the past hundred years.  Fun for the math content and historical/nostalgia value.  Relive the four-color theorem, Fermat, fractals, and early computing.
 
I have too much of a technical bent to be the ideal reader for this sort of book, but it seems like an excellent gift for a non-technical reader who nonetheless enjoys math.  (I assume that such people are out there, just as there are people like me who canâ&euro;&trade;t read music but still enjoy reading about the subject.)
 
The book is organized by topic.  My own preference would have been chronological and with more old stuff.  I particularly enjoyed the material from many decades ago, such as the news report on one of the early computers.  This must have been a fun book to compile.</p><p>2 0.97398102 <a title="1843-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians%3A_When_We_Teach%2C_We_Don%E2%80%99t_Practice_What_We_Preach.html">1237 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians: When We Teach, We Don’t Practice What We Preach</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As announced  earlier , I’ll be putting my Bayesian Data Analysis course on a G+ hangout.  It meets each Friday 8h30 Paris time, starting 18 Oct.
 
Just to try things out, I’ll do a mini-hangout tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30.  What I’ll do is set up the hangout, then post the url in a new blog post.  I’ll then talk for a few minutes.  You should be able to click the url into your browser and see me.
 
If this all works, I’ll do the same thing this Friday 8h30, with a new blog post and a new url.</p><p>5 0.94496059 <a title="1843-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-23-The_economics_of_the_mac%3F__A_paradox_of_competition.html">867 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-23-The economics of the mac?  A paradox of competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I switched to the mac and it’s great  I’d like a bit more real estate on my laptop but Malecki assures me that soon I’ll get used to jumping between windows.
 
Anyway, my impression is that now the mac dominates the pc, but a few years ago it wasn’t so clear.  The mac had some nice features but often ran slowly, and thinkpads could do a lot.  At the time, the way I understood this was that only one company made macs but several made pc’s, thus there was a lot of competition, stimulating innovation in the pc market.
 
But what’s the story now?  The macbook air is awesome and a real advance on what came before, while the thinkpads and all the rest have stagnated.  So what’s my new theory?  There’s lots of competition on pc’s, but what they’re all competing on is price.  Meanwhile, only one company makes the mac and so they have the freedom to make something good.
 
But I’m just blathering here.  I’m sure someone can offer some thick description to reveal the real story.</p><p>6 0.94261301 <a title="1843-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-16-Detecting_cheating_in_chess.html">1676 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-16-Detecting cheating in chess</a></p>

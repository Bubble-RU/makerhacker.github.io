<p>Introduction: A  link  from Simon Jackman’s blog led me to  an article  by James Heckman, Hedibert Lopes, and Remi Piatek from 2011, “Treatment effects:  A Bayesian perspective.”  I was pleasantly surprised to see this, partly because I didn’t know that Heckman was working on Bayesian methods, and partly because the paper explicitly refers to the “potential outcomes model,” a term I associate with Don Rubin.  I’ve had the impression that Heckman and Rubin don’t like each other (I was a student of Rubin and have never met Heckman, so I’m only speaking at second hand here), so I was happy to see some convergence.
 
I was curious how Heckman et al. would source the potential outcome model.  They do not refer to Rubin’s 1974 paper or to Neyman’s 1923 paper (which was republished in 1990 and is now taken to be the founding document of the Neyman-Rubin approach to causal inference).  Nor, for that matter, do Heckman et al. refer to the more recent developments of these theories by Robins, Pearl, and other</p><p>4 0.12629324 <a title="2090-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-23-More_on_Bayesian_methods_and_multilevel_modeling.html">2033 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-23-More on Bayesian methods and multilevel modeling</a></p>

In a previous post, http://andrewgelman.com/2013/07/30/the-roy-causal-model/ you pointed to a paper on Bayesian methods by Heckman. At around the same time I came across another one of his papers, “The Effects of Cognitive and Noncognitive Abilities on Labor Market Outcomes and Social Behavior (2006)” (http://www.nber.org/papers/w12006 or published version http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/504455). In this paper they implement their model as follows:

 
We use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to compute the sample likelihood. Our use of Bayesian methods is only a computational convenience. Our identification analysis is strictly classical. Under our assumptions, the priors we use are asymptotically irrelevant.
 

Some of the authors have also done something similar earlier in:

<p>Introduction: Benedict Carey  writes  a follow-up article on ESP studies and Bayesian statistics.  ( See here  for my previous thoughts on the topic.)  Everything Carey writes is fine, and he even uses an example I recommended:
  
The statistical approach that has dominated the social sciences for almost a century is called significance testing. The idea is straightforward. A finding from any well-designed study — say, a correlation between a personality trait and the risk of depression — is considered “significant” if its probability of occurring by chance is less than 5 percent.


This arbitrary cutoff makes sense when the effect being studied is a large one — for example, when measuring the so-called Stroop effect. This effect predicts that naming the color of a word is faster and more accurate when the word and color match (“red” in red letters) than when they do not (“red” in blue letters), and is very strong in almost everyone.

<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: Two different people pointed me to  this article  by Vlastimil Hart et al. in the journal Frontiers in Zoology: 
  
  
It is for the first time that (a) magnetic sensitivity was proved in dogs, (b) a measurable, predictable behavioral reaction upon natural MF fluctuations could be unambiguously proven in a mammal, and (c) high sensitivity to small changes in polarity, rather than in intensity, of MF was identified as biologically meaningful. Our findings open new horizons in magnetoreception research. Since the MF is calm in only about 20 % of the daylight period, our findings might provide an explanation why many magnetoreception experiments were hardly replicable and why directional values of records in diverse observations are frequently compromised by scatter.

<p>Introduction: Ryan King writes:
  
I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.  Given the massive scale of the datasets (genetics …), extensive sensitivity a</p><p>2 0.98275697 <a title="2090-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-25-Avoiding_boundary_estimates_using_a_prior_distribution_as_regularization.html">779 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-25-Avoiding boundary estimates using a prior distribution as regularization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For awhile I’ve been fitting most of my multilevel models using lmer/glmer, which gives point estimates of the group-level variance parameters (maximum marginal likelihood estimate for lmer and an approximation for glmer).  I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.  Typically, when this happens, it’s not that we’re so sure the variance is close to zero or that the correlation is close to 1 or -1; rather, the marginal likelihood does not provide a lot of information about these parameters of the group-level error distribution.
 
I don’t want point estimates on the boundary.  I don’t want to say that the unexplained variance in some dimension is exactly zero.

<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>4 0.97955394 <a title="2090-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-%E2%80%9CThe_difference_between_._._.%E2%80%9D%3A__It%E2%80%99s_not_just_p%3D.05_vs._p%3D.06.html">1072 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-“The difference between . . .”:  It’s not just p=.05 vs. p=.06</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of  this post  by Sanjay Srivastava illustrates an annoying misconception that’s crept into the (otherwise delightful) recent  publicity  related to my  article  with Hal Stern, he difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant.
 
When people bring this up, they keep referring to the difference between p=0.05 and p=0.06, making the familiar (and correct) point about the arbitrariness of the conventional p-value threshold of 0.05.  And, sure, I agree with this, but everybody knows that already.
 
The point Hal and I were making was that even apparently large differences in p-values are not statistically significant. For example, if you have one study with z=2.5 (almost significant at the 1% level!) and another with z=1 (not statistically significant at all, only 1 se from zero!), then their difference has a z of about 1 (again, not statistically significant at all). So it’s not just a comparison of 0.05 vs. 0.06, even a differenc</p><p>5 0.97932452 <a title="2090-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Steve_Jobs%E2%80%99s_cancer_and_science-based_medicine.html">953 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Steve Jobs’s cancer and science-based medicine</a></p>

I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.

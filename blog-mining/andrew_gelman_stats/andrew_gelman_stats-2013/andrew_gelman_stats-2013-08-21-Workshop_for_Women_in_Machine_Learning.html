<p>Introduction: If you need an excuse to go skiing in Tahoe next month, our paper on Stan as a probabilistic programming language was accepted for:
  
  Workshop on Probabilistic Programming  
NIPS 2012 
7–8 December, 2012, Lake Tahoe, Nevada
   
The workshop is organized by the folks behind the probabilistic programming language  Church  and has a great lineup of invited speakers (Chris Bishop, Josh Tennenbaum, and Stuart Russell).  And in case you’re interested in the main conference, here’s the list of accepted  NIPS 2012 papers and posters .  
 
To learn more about Stan, check out the links to the manual on the
  
  Stan Home Page  
  
We’ll put up a link to our final NIPS workshop paper there when we finish it.</p><p>3 0.28728554 <a title="1992-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-21-Workshop_on_science_communication_for_graduate_students.html">1687 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-21-Workshop on science communication for graduate students</a></p>

Participants will build the communication skills that technical professionals need to express complex ideas to their peers, experts in other fields, and the general public.  There will be panel discussions on the following topics:


* Engaging Non-Scientific Audiences 
* Science Writing for a Cause 
* Communicating Science Through Fiction 
* Sharing Science with Scientists

<p>Introduction: David Ebert sends this along:
  
Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>4 0.68960249 <a title="1992-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Time_to_apply_for_the_hackNY_summer_fellows_program.html">412 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Time to apply for the hackNY summer fellows program</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Wiggins writes of an interesting-looking summer program that undergraduate or graduate students can apply to:
  
The hackNY Fellows program is an initiative to mentor the next generation of technology innovators in New York, focusing on tech startups. Last summer’s  class of fellows  was paired with NYC startups which demonstrated they could provide a mentoring environment (a clear project, a person who could work with the Fellow, and sufficient stability to commit to 10 weeks of compensation for the Fellow).  hackNY, with the support of the Kauffman foundation and the Internet Society of New York, provided shared housing in NYU dorms in Union Square, and organized a series of pedagogical lectures. 


hackNY was founded by Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly, Evan Korth, professor of CS at NYU, and Chris Wiggins, professor of applied mathematics at Columbia. Each of us has spent thousands of student-hours teaching and mentoring, and is committed to help build a strong communi</p><p>5 0.66911203 <a title="1992-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-23-AI_Stats_conference_on_Stan_etc..html">1911 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-23-AI Stats conference on Stan etc.</a></p>

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS


Workshop for Women in Machine Learning 
Co-located with NIPS 2013, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, USA 
December 5, 2013


http://www.wimlworkshop.org


Deadline for abstract submissions: September 16, 2013
  
  
  
WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


The Workshop for Women in Machine Learning is a day-long event taking place on the first day of NIPS. 
The workshop aims to showcase the research of women in machine learning and to strengthen their community. 
The event brings together female faculty, graduate students, and research scientists for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in pursuing machine learning research are encouraged to participate. While all presenters will be female, all genders are invited to attend.


Scholarships will be provided to female students and postdoctoral attendees with accepted abstracts to partially offset travel costs.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  asks  the interesting question:  How do you measure what restaurants are “overrated”?  You can’t just ask people, right?  There’s some sort of social element here, that “overrated” implies that someone’s out there doing the rating.</p><p>3 0.90920591 <a title="1992-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-04-Bayesian_Page_Rank%3F.html">1098 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-04-Bayesian Page Rank?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Loren Maxwell writes: 
  
  
I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.


For example, in the attached spreadsheet, Column D shows e</p><p>4 0.86042869 <a title="1992-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-22-Grade_inflation%3A_why_weren%E2%80%99t_the_instructors_all_giving_all_A%E2%80%99s_already%3F%3F.html">1507 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-22-Grade inflation: why weren’t the instructors all giving all A’s already??</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My upstairs colleague Blattman  writes :
  
The trend is unsurprising. Schools have every incentive to move to the highest four or five piles [grades] possible. . . . Then grade inflation will stop because . . there will be nowhere to go. . . . So why resist the new equilibrium?
  
I don’t have any argument for resisting, but I don’t think everything’s quite so simple as Chris is saying.
 
First, you can easily get compression so that almost everyone gets the same grade (“A”).  So, no four or five piles.
 
Second, the incentives for grading high have been there for awhile.  To me, the more interesting question is:  how is it that grade inflation hasn’t gone faster?  Why would it take so many decades to reach a natural and obvious equilibrium?  Here’s what I wrote  last year : 
   
As a teacher who, like many others, assigns grades in an unregulated environment (that is, we have no standardized tests and no rules on how we should grade), all the incentives to toward giving only A’s:  Wh</p><p>5 0.85927987 <a title="1992-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-09-Using_ranks_as_numbers.html">136 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-09-Using ranks as numbers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Shor writes:
  
I’m dealing with a situation where I have two datasets, one that assigns each participant a discrete score out of five for a set of particular traits (Dog behavior characteristics by breed), and another from an independent source that ranks each breed by each characteristic. It’s also possible to obtain the results of a survey, where experts were asked to rank 7 randomly picked breeds by characteristics.


I’m interested in obtaining estimates for each trait, and intuitively, it seems clear that the second and third dataset provide a lot of information. But it’s unclear how to incorporate them to infer latent variables, since only sample ranks are observed. This seems like it is a common problem, do you have any suggestions?
  
My quick answer is that you can treat ranks as numbers (a point we make somewhere in Bayesian Data Analysis, I believe) and just fit an item-response model from there.

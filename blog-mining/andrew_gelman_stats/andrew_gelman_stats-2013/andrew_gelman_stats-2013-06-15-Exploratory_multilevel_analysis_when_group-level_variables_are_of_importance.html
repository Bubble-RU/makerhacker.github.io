I am using a multilevel model with three levels. I read that you wrote a book about multilevel models, and wonder if you can solve the following question.  


The data structure is like this: 


Level one: customer (8444 customers) 
Level two: companys (90 companies) 
Level three: industry (17 industries) 


I use 6 level-three variables (i.e. industry characteristics) to explain the variance of the level-one effect across industries. The question here is whether there is an over-fitting problem since there are only 17 industries. I understand that this must be a problem for non-multilevel models, but is it also a problem for multilevel models?
  
My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.  This is an interesting and important area of statistics research, to do this sort of thing systematically.

Suppose I have survey data from  say 10 countries where by each country collected the data based on different sampling routines –  the results of this being that  each country has its own weights for the data that can be used in the analyses. If I analyse the data of each country separately then I can incorporate the survey design in the analyses e.g in Stata once can use svyset …..


But what happens when I want to do a pooled analysis of the all the data from the 10 countries:


Presumably either 


1.  I analyse the data from each country separately (using multiple or logistic regression, …) accounting for the survey design and then combine the estimates using a meta analysis (fixed or random)


  OR


2.  Assume that the data from each country is a simple random sample from the population, combine the data from the 10 countries and then use multilevel or hierarchical models

<p>Introduction: Having established that survey weighting is a mess, I should also acknowledge that, by this standard, regression modeling is also a mess, involving many arbitrary choices of variable selection, transformations and modeling of interaction. Nonetheless, regression modeling is a mess with which I am comfortable and, perhaps more relevant to the discussion, can be extended using multilevel models to get inference for small cross-classifications or small areas.

<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>4 0.82721311 <a title="1900-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-28-Using_randomized_incentives_as_an_instrument_for_survey_nonresponse%3F.html">2152 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-28-Using randomized incentives as an instrument for survey nonresponse?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following question:
  
Is there a classic paper on instrumenting for survey non-response?  some colleagues in public health are going to carry out a survey and I wonder about suggesting that they build in a randomization of response-encouragement (e.g. offering additional $ to a subset of those who don’t respond initially).  Can you recommend a basic treatment of this, and why it might or might not make sense compared to IPW using covariates (without an instrument)?
  
My reply:   Here’s  the best analysis I know of on the effects of incentives for survey response.  There have been several survey-experiments on the subject.  The short answer is that the effect on nonresponse is small and the outcome is highly variable, hence you can’t very well use it as an instrument in any particular survey.
 
My recommended approach to dealing with nonresponse is to use multilevel regression and poststratification; an example is  here .

<p>Introduction: David Hogg points me to  this  announcement of a program from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics of the National Science Foundation:
  
The Center would like to enhance its efforts to support analytic and methodological research in support of its surveys, and to engage in the education and training of researchers in the use of large-scale nationally representative datasets. NCSES welcomes efforts by the research community to use NCSES data for research on the science and technology enterprise.
  
This sounds like a job for Mister P.  My first thought when David sent this to me was  not  to post it, because maybe I’d want to apply myself!  But then I thought better of my piggy instincts, so here it is.  I think some of the readers of this blog are doing research that would be relevant for this program, so . . . go for it!</p><p>2 0.98998117 <a title="1900-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-20-%E2%80%9CPeople_with_an_itch_to_scratch%E2%80%9D.html">101 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-20-“People with an itch to scratch”</a></p>

I have just finished my Ph.D. in statistics and am currently working in applied statistics (plant ecology) using Bayesian statistics.  As the statistician in the group I only ever get the ‘hard analysis’ problems that don’t readily fit into standard models.  As I delve into the computational aspects of Bayesian analysis, I find myself increasingly frustrated with the current set of tools.  I was delighted to see  JAGS 2.0  just came out and spent yesterday happily playing with it.


My question is, where do you see the short-term future of Bayesian computing going and what can we do to steer it in a particular direction?
      
In your book with Dr Hill, you mention that you expect BUGS (or its successor) to become increasingly sophisticated and, for example, re-parameterizations that increase convergence rates would be handled automatically.  Just as R has been successful because users can extend it, I think progress here also will be made by input from ‘p</p><p>3 0.98864782 <a title="1900-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-08-Of_parsing_and_chess.html">1847 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-08-Of parsing and chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus  writes ,
  
An algorithm that is good at chess won’t help parsing sentences, and one that parses sentences likely won’t be much help playing chess.
  
That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.  I’d much rather have had twice as much detail on the first part of the life and then had the post-1972 era compr</p><p>same-blog 4 0.98860085 <a title="1900-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-15-Exploratory_multilevel_analysis_when_group-level_variables_are_of_importance.html">1900 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-15-Exploratory multilevel analysis when group-level variables are of importance</a></p>

Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

I’m happy to see you’ve articulated similar gripes I had w/ the piece, which makes me feel like I’m not crazy. I remember discussing this with colleagues (I work at a research institute w/ economists) and only a couple of them shared any concern. It seems that by virtue of being published in ‘the AER’ the results are unquestionable. I agree that the idea is interesting and worth pursuing but as you say it’s one thing to go from that to asserting ‘causality’ (I still don’t know what definition of causality they’re using?). All the data torture along the way is just tipping the hat to convention rather than serving any scientific purpose.
  
Some researchers are so uptight about identification that, when they think they have it, all their skepticism dissolves.

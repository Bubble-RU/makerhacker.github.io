<p>Introduction: James Robins, Tyler VanderWeele, and Richard Gill  write :
  
Neyman introduced a formal mathematical theory of counterfactual causation that now has become standard language in many quantitative disciplines, but not in physics. We use results on causal interaction and interference between treatments (derived under the Neyman theory) to give a simple new proof of a well-known result in quantum physics, namely, Bellís inequality.


Now the predictions of quantum mechanics and the results of experiment both violate Bell’s inequality. In the remainder of the talk, we review the implications for a counterfactual theory of causation. Assuming with Einstein that faster than light (supraluminal) communication is not possible, one can view the Neyman theory of counterfactuals as falsified by experiment. . . .


Is it safe for a quantitative discipline to rely on a counterfactual approach to causation, when our best confirmed physical theory falsifies their existence?

<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.

My reply:  I’m a big fan of Popper (search this blog for details), especially as interpreted by Lakatos, but as far as I can tell, Popper’s theory of probability is hopeless.

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Mike Betancourt and I wrote a discussion for the article, Can quantum probability provide a new direction for cognitive modeling?, by Emmanuel Pothos and Jerome Busemeyer, in Behavioral and Brain Sciences.  We didn’t say much, but it was a milestone for me because, with this article, BBS became the 100th journal I’d published in.
 
Anyway, the full article with its 34 discussions just appeared  in the journal .   Here  it is.
 
What surprised me, in reading the full discussion, was how supportive the commentary was.  Given the topic of Pothos and Busemeyer’s article, I was expecting the discussions to range from gentle mockery to outright abuse.  The discussion that Mike and I wrote was moderately encouraging, and I was expecting this to fall on the extreme positive end of the spectrum.
 
Actually, though, most of the discussions were positive, and only a couple were purely negative (those would be “Quantum models of cognition as Orwellian newspeak” by Michael Lee a</p><p>5 0.89437604 <a title="1857-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-29-I_agree_with_this_comment.html">2272 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-29-I agree with this comment</a></p>

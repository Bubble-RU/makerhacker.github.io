</p><p>9 I beat my dad, who on occasion beat his dad, who was really good. [sent-19, score-1.018]
</p><p>10 Grandpa Moses probably beat some serious tournament players from time to time (he played at coffeehouses etc. [sent-20, score-1.105]
</p><p>11 , not tournaments, but I think some competitive players would show up), and one of the people he beat must have had a win against one of the top U. [sent-21, score-0.701]
</p><p>12 Just take the oldest guy who Kasparov ever lost to, then the oldest American player that guy lost to, . [sent-29, score-0.635]
</p><p>13 So then my Kasparov number would be 9 (dad, grandpa, the (hypothetical) tournament player my grandpa beat, the top guy he beat, then the next 2 guys in the chain, then the American player who beat the old guy who beat Kasparov). [sent-33, score-2.18]

</p><p>16 If I were to count it though, then I’m pretty sure this guy got into a lot of fights after that, but it would take a long long chain of slugging to get to Michael Spinks or whatever. [sent-42, score-0.377]
</p><p>17 If my Ali number (or even my Chuck Wepner number) is less than infinity, it must be in the hundreds. [sent-43, score-0.157]
</p><p>18 Phil reports that the best opponent he ever beat in a tournament had a rating of something like  1562  1800, so maybe we could get to Kasparov that way. [sent-46, score-0.795]
</p><p>19 Someone who was 1800 when he played Phil might ultimately have reached 1900 and beat someone who at some point reached 2100, etc etc etc. [sent-47, score-1.047]
</p><p>20 I don’t really have a good sense of whether the Phil path or the Grandpa path would get me faster to that elusive Kasparov victory. [sent-48, score-0.168]

That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.

<p>Introduction: Today I was reminded of a riddle from junior high: 
Q:  What do you get when you cross an elephant with peanut butter? 
A:  Peanut butter that never forgets, or an elephant that sticks to the roof of your mouth.
 
The occasion was a  link  from Tyler Cowen to a new book by Garry Kasparov and . . . Peter Thiel.
 
Kasparov we all know about.  I still remember how he pulled out a victory in  the last game of his tournament with Karpov.  Just amazing:  he had to win the game, a draw would not be enough.  Both players knew that Kasparov had to win.  And he did it.  A feat as impressive as Kirk Gibson’s off-the-bench game-winning home run in the 1987 Series.
 
Peter Theil is a more obscure figure.  He’s been featured a  couple  of  times  on this blog and comes across as your typical overconfident rich dude.
 
It’s an odd combination, sort of like what you might get if Rickey Henderson and Peter Angelos were to write a book about how to reform baseball.

My question is about Bayesian analysis of the linear regression model. It seems to me that in some cases this approach throws out useful information.


As an example, imagine you have two basketball players randomly drawn from the pool of NBA players (which provides the prior). You’d like to estimate how many free throws each can make out of 100. You have two pieces of information:


- Session 1: Each player shoots 100 shots, and you learn player A’s total minus player B’s total


- Session 2: Player A does another session where he shoots 100 shots alone, and you learn his total


If we take the regression approach:


y_i = number of shots made 
beta_A = player A’s expected number out of 100 
beta_B = player B’s expected number out of 100 
x_i = vector of zeros and ones showing which player took shots


In the above example, our datapoints are:


y_1 (first number reported) = beta_A * 1 + beta_B * (-1) + epsilon_1 
y_2 (second number reported) = beta_A * 1 +</p><p>6 0.12239386 <a title="2105-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-30-%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_at_least_as_much_as_an_80_percent_chance_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">982 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-30-“There’s at least as much as an 80 percent chance . . .”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>4 0.84064811 <a title="2105-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-16-Chess_vs._checkers.html">615 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-16-Chess vs. checkers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces. The result is a series of elegant graph problems where the viable paths change with each move of your opponent. To draw an analogy with chess, imagine if moving your knight could allow your opponent’s bishop to move like a rook. Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?


Part of the problem is that we learn the game as children so we tend to think of it as a children’s game. We focus on how simple the rules are and miss how much complexity and subtlety you can get out of those ru</p><p>5 0.84010082 <a title="2105-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-23-The_pinch-hitter_syndrome_again.html">1467 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-23-The pinch-hitter syndrome again</a></p>

P.S.  Just a thought:  is it possible that one reason for the effectiveness of relief pitchers is that, by the end of the game, the starting players (that is, the hitters who have been playing all game) are getting tired?  Iâ&euro;&trade;m pretty sure that lots of baseball-statistics experts will know the answer to this.</p><p>6 0.79590434 <a title="2105-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-25-Diving_chess.html">1638 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-25-Diving chess</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Personally my Kasparov number is two: I beat ** in a regular tournament game, and ** beat Kasparov!
  
That’s pretty impressive, especially given that I didn’t know this guy played chess at all!  Anyway, this got me thinking, what’s my Kasparov number?  OK, that’s easy.  I beat Magnus Carlsen the other day when he was passing through town on vacation, Carlsen beat Anand, . . .
 
OK, just kidding.  What  is  my Kasparov number, though? Note that the definition, unlike that of the Erdos or Bacon numbers, is asymmetric:  it has to be that I had a victory over person 1, and person 1 had a victory over person 2, etc., and ultimately person N-1 had a victory over Kasparov.  The games don’t have to be in time order, they just all have to be victories.  And we’ll further require that the games all be played after childhood and before senility (i.e., it doesn’t count if I happened to play someone who happens to be a cousin of some grandmaster whom he beat when they were b</p><p>2 0.84440124 <a title="2105-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-10-%E2%80%9CProposition_and_experiment%E2%80%9D.html">1797 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-10-“Proposition and experiment”</a></p>

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.

<p>Introduction: Washington Post and Slate reporter Anne Applebaum wrote a  dismissive  column about Wikileaks, saying that they “offer nothing more than raw data.”
 
Applebaum argues that “The notion that the Internet can replace traditional news-gathering has just been revealed to be a myth. . . . without more journalism, more investigation, more work, these documents just don’t matter that much.”
 
Fine.  But don’t undervalue the role of mere data!  The usual story is that we  don’t  get to see the raw data underlying newspaper stories.  Wikileaks and other crowdsourced data can be extremely useful, whether or not they replace “traditional news-gathering.”</p><p>4 0.82502675 <a title="2105-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-Obama_and_Reagan%2C_sitting_in_a_tree%2C_etc..html">551 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-Obama and Reagan, sitting in a tree, etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>5 0.82186675 <a title="2105-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-10-Stan_Model_of_the_Week%3A__PK_Calculation_of_IV_and_Oral_Dosing.html">2242 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-10-Stan Model of the Week:  PK Calculation of IV and Oral Dosing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: [Update: Revised given comments from Wingfeet, Andrew and germo.  Thanks!  I'd mistakenly translated the dlnorm priors in the first version --- amazing what a difference the priors make.  I also escaped the less-than and greater-than signs in the constraints in the model so they're visible.  I also updated to match the thin=2 output of JAGS.]
 
We’re going to be starting a Stan “model of the P” (for some time period P) column, so I thought I’d kick things off with one of my own.  I’ve been following the  Wingvoet blog , the author of which is identified only by the Blogger handle  Wingfeet ;  a couple of days ago this lovely post came out:
  
  PK calculation of IV and oral dosing in JAGS 
   
Wingfeet’s post implemented an answer to question 6 from chapter 6 of problem from Rowland and Tozer’s 2010 book,   Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  , Fourth edition, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins.

<p>Introduction: Social science research has been getting pretty bad press recently, what with the Excel buccaneers who didn’t know how to handle data with different numbers of observations per country, and the psychologist who published dozens of papers based on fabricated data, and the Evilicious guy who wouldn’t let people review his data tapes, etc etc.  And that’s not even considering Dr. Anil Potti.
 
On the other hand, the revelation of all these problems can be taken as evidence that things are getting better.  Psychology researcher Gary Marcus  writes :
  
There is something positive that has come out of the crisis of replicability—something vitally important for all experimental sciences. For years, it was extremely difficult to publish a direct replication, or a failure to replicate an experiment, in a good journal. . . . Now, happily, the scientific culture has changed. . . . The Reproducibility Project, from the Center for Open Science is now underway . . .

<p>Introduction: Another entry in the growing literature on systematic flaws in the scientific research literature.
 
This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data. Regrettably, only 24% of the authors shared their data, despite our request</p><p>4 0.12641908 <a title="1842-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t_think_of_it_as_duplication._Think_of_it_as_a_single_paper_in_a_superposition_of_two_quantum_journals.%E2%80%9D.html">1654 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-“Don’t think of it as duplication.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>5 0.11878934 <a title="1842-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-09-The_difference_between_significant_and_not_significant%E2%80%A6.html">897 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-09-The difference between significant and not significant…</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve earlier written that  science is science communication —that is, the act of communicating scientific ideas and findings to ourselves and others is itself a central part of science.  My point was to push against a conventional separation between the act of science and the act of communication, the idea that science is done by scientists and communication is done by communicators.  It’s a rare bit of science that does not include communication as part of it.  As a scientist and science communicator myself, I’m particularly sensitive to devaluing of communication.  (For example, Bayesian Data Analysis is full of original research that was done in order to communicate; or, to put it another way, we often think we understand a scientific idea, but once we try to communicate it, we recognize gaps in our understanding that motivate further research.)
 
I once saw the following on one of those inspirational-sayings-for-every-day desk calendars: “To have ideas is to gather flowers.

<p>Introduction: I pointed Steven Pinker to my post,  How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless? , and he responded:
  
Clearly it *is* important to call out publicized research whose conclusions are likely to be false. The only danger is that it’s so easy and fun to criticize, with all the perks of intellectual and moral superiority for so little cost, that there is a moral hazard to go overboard and become a professional slasher and snarker. (That’s a common phenomenon among literary critics, especially in the UK.) There’s also the risk of altering the incentive structure for innovative research, so that researchers stick to the safest kinds of paradigm-twiddling. I think these two considerations were what my late colleague Dan Wegner had in mind when he made the bumbler-pointer contrast — he himself was certainly a discerning critic of social science research.

<p>Introduction: This is a killer story  (from Brian Nosek, Jeffrey Spies, and Matt Motyl).
 
Part 1:
  
Two of the present authors, Motyl and Nosek, share interests in political ideology. We were inspired by the fast growing literature on embodiment that demonstrates surprising links between body and mind (Markman & Brendl, 2005; Proffitt, 2006) to investigate embodiment of political extremism. Participants from the political left, right and center (N = 1,979) completed a perceptual judgment task in which words were presented in different shades of gray. Participants had to click along a gradient representing grays from near black to near white to select a shade that matched the shade of the word. We calculated accuracy: How close to the actual shade did participants get? The results were stunning. Moderates perceived the shades of gray more accurately than extremists on the left and right (p = .01).

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this post  by Gary Marcus, reviewing  this skeptics’ all-star issue  of Perspectives on Psychological Science that features replication culture heroes Jelte Wicherts, Hal Pashler, Arina Bones, E. J. Wagenmakers, Gregory Francis, Hal Pashler, John Ioannidis, and Uri Simonsohn.  I agree with pretty much everything Marcus has to say.  In addition to Marcus’s suggestions, which might be called cultural or psychological, I also have various statistical ideas that might help move the field forward.  Most notably I think we  need  to go beyond uniform priors and null-hypothesis testing to a more realistic set of models for effects and variation.  I’ll discuss more at some other time, but in the meantime I thought I’d share these links.
 
P.S.  Marcus  updates  with a glass-is-half-full take.</p><p>2 0.87709492 <a title="1842-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-05-High_temperatures_cause_violent_crime_and_implications_for_climate_change%2C_also_some_suggestions_about_how_to_better_summarize_these_claims.html">1522 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-05-High temperatures cause violent crime and implications for climate change, also some suggestions about how to better summarize these claims</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  writes :
  
I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years. The results tell the aggression story using street-level data very clearly  [click to</p><p>3 0.87407416 <a title="1842-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-10-Don%E2%80%99t_trust_the_Turk.html">1932 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-10-Don’t trust the Turk</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>5 0.86299717 <a title="1842-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>6 0.86231232 <a title="1842-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-23-AI_Stats_conference_on_Stan_etc..html">1911 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-23-AI Stats conference on Stan etc.</a></p>

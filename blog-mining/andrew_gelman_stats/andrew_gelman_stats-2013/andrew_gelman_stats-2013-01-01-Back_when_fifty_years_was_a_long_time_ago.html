<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>4 0.13291976 <a title="1646-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-17-The_disappearing_or_non-disappearing_middle_class.html">1767 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-17-The disappearing or non-disappearing middle class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Despite the title, this post is mostly not about economics or even politics but rather about the central role of  comparisons  in statistics and statistical graphics.
 
It started when someone pointed me to  this article  in which Megan McArdle points out the misleadingness of a graph that seems to show a bimodal income distribution but only by combining cells in the tail:
 
 
 
McArdle makes a good point:  of course, if you spread the histogram along a uniform scale (or, for that matter, a log scale), you don’t see that bump at the high end.  McArdle reproduces some Census charts showing income stability over the past few decades:
 
 
 
Before I had a chance to chance to write about this, I noticed that Mark Palko  did the job  for me.  Palko writes:
  
To the extent that statistics includes data visualization, this is definitely bad statistics.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
I can understand the appeal of the cutting edge. The new stuff is sexier. It gets people’s attention. The trouble is, those cutting edge studies often collapse under scrutiny. Some can’t be replicated. Others prove to be not that important.


Confirmation, on the other hand, is not sexy. It doesn’t drive traffic. It’s harder to fit into a paragraph. In a way, though, it’s more interesting because it has a high likelihood of being true and fills in the gaps in big, important questions. The interaction between the ideas is usually the interesting part.
  
In this particular example, Palko is telling the story of a journalist who reports a finding as new when it is essentially a replication of decades-old work.  Palko’s point is not that there’s anything wrong with replication but rather that the journalist seems to feel that it is necessary to report the idea as new and cutting-edge, even if it falls within a long tradition.

<p>Introduction: New Year’s Day is an excellent time to look back at changes, not just in the past year, but in the past half-century.
 
Mark Palko has an interesting  post  on the pace of changes in everyday life.  We’ve been hearing a lot in the past few decades about how things are changing faster and faster.  But, as Palko points out, the difference between life in 1962 and life today does not seem so different, at least for many people in the United States.  Sure, there are some big changes:  nonwhites get more respect, people mostly live longer, many cancers can be cured, fewer people are really really poor but it’s harder to hold down a job, cars are more reliable, you can get fresh fish in the suburbs, containers are lighter and stronger, vacations in the Caribbean instead of the Catskills, people have a lot more stuff and a lot more place to put it, etc etc etc.  But life in the 1950s or 1960s just doesn’t seem so different from how we live today.

<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .
  
OK, fine, so individual creatives aren’t doing so well?  But what about the larger urban economies?

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Salmon is dismissive of the claim that there are fifty million over-the-air television viewers:

 
The 50 million number, by the way, should not be considered particularly reliable: it’s Aereo’s guess as to the number of people who ever watch free-to-air TV, even if they mainly watch cable or satellite. (Maybe they have a hut somewhere with an old rabbit-ear TV in it.)
 

And he strongly suggests the number is not only smaller but shrinking. By comparison, here’s a story from the broadcasting news site TV News Check from June of last year (if anyone has more recent numbers please let me know):

 
According to new research by GfK Media, the number of Americans now relying solely on over-the-air (OTA) television reception increased to almost 54 million, up from 46 million just a year ago. The recently completed survey also found that the demographics of broadcast-only households skew towards younger adults, minorities and lower-income families.

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

<p>Introduction: Daniel Mendelsohn recently  asked , “Why do we love the Titanic?”, seeking to understand how it has happened that: 
  
  
It may not be true that ‘the three most written-about subjects of all time are Jesus, the Civil War, and the Titanic,’ as one historian has put it, but it’s not much of an exaggeration. . . . The inexhaustible interest suggests that the Titanic’s story taps a vein much deeper than the morbid fascination that has attached to other disasters. The explosion of the Hindenburg, for instance, and even the torpedoing, just three years after the Titanic sank, of the Lusitania, another great liner whose passenger list boasted the rich and the famous, were calamities that shocked the world but have failed to generate an obsessive preoccupation. . . . 


If the Titanic has gripped our imagination so forcefully for the past century, it must be because of something bigger than any fact of social or political or cultural history.

My reply:  All’s well with me.  And yes, that’s one horrible graph.  It has all the problems with a bad infographic with none of the virtues.  Compared to this monstrosity, the typical USA Today graph is a stunning, beautiful masterpiece.  I don’t think I want to soil this webpage with the image.

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>3 0.95886451 <a title="1646-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-23-Foundation_for_Open_Access_Statistics.html">1820 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-23-Foundation for Open Access Statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now here’s a foundation I (Bob) can get behind: 
  

 Foundation for Open Access Statistics  (FOAS)

  
Their  mission  is to “promote free software, open access publishing, and reproducible research in statistics.”  To me, that’s like supporting  motherhood and apple pie !
 
FOAS spun out of and is partially designed to support the   Journal of Statistical Software   (aka  JSS , aka  JStatSoft ). I adore  JSS  because it (a) is open access, (b) publishes systems papers on statistical software, (c) has fast reviewing turnaround times, and (d) is free for authors and readers.  One of the next items on my to-do list is to write up the  Stan  modeling language and submit it to  JSS .
 
As a not-for-profit with no visible source of income, they are quite sensibly  asking for donations  (don’t complain — it beats $3K author fees or not being able to read papers).</p><p>4 0.95573097 <a title="1646-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-09-%E2%80%9CMuch_of_the_recent_reported_drop_in_interstate_migration_is_a_statistical_artifact%E2%80%9D.html">404 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-09-“Much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Greg Kaplan writes:
  
I noticed that you have blogged a little about interstate migration trends in the US, and thought  that you might be interested in  a new working paper  of mine (joint with Sam Schulhofer-Wohl from the Minneapolis Fed) which I have attached.


Briefly, we show that much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact: The Census Bureau made an undocumented change in its imputation procedures for missing data in 2006, and this change significantly reduced the number of imputed interstate moves. The change in imputation procedures — not any actual change in migration behavior — explains 90 percent of the reported decrease in interstate migration between the 2005 and 2006 Current Population Surveys, and 42 percent of the decrease between 2000 and 2010.

I’m reminded of our recent  discussions  of coauthorship, where I argued that I see real advantages to having multiple people taking responsibility for the result.  Jay Verkuilen responded: “On the flipside of collaboration . . . is diffusion of responsibility, where everybody thinks someone else ‘has that problem’ and thus things don’t get solved.”  That’s what seems to have happened (hilariously) here.</p><p>6 0.94207847 <a title="1646-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-The_most_dangerous_jobs_in_America.html">1086 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-The most dangerous jobs in America</a></p>

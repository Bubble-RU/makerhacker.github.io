<p>Introduction: Sociologist Fabio Rojas  reports  on “a conversation I [Rojas] have had a few times with statisticians”:
  
Rojas:  “What does your research tell us about a sample of, say, a few hundred cases?”


Statistician: “That’s not important. My result works as n–> 00.”


Rojas: “Sure, that’s a fine mathematical result, but I have to estimate the model with, like, totally finite data. I need inference, not limits. Maybe the estimate doesn’t work out so well for small n.”


Statistician: “Sure, but if you have a few million cases, it’ll work in the limit.”


Rojas: “Whoa. Have you ever collected, like, real world network data? A million cases is hard to get.”
  
The conversation continues in this frustrating vein.  Rojas writes:
  
This illustrates a fundamental issue in statistics (and other sciences). One you formalize a model and work mathematically, you are tempted to focus on what is mathematically interesting instead of the underlying problem motivating the science. . . .

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas  writes :
  
After reading the  Fowler/Christakis paper on networks and obesity , a student asked why it was that friends had a stronger influence on spouses. In other words, if we believe the F&C; paper, they report that your friends (57%) are more likely to transmit obesity than your spouse (37%) (see page 370).


This might be interpreted in two ways. First, it might be seen as a counter argument. This might really indicate that homophily is at work. We probably select spouses for some traits that are not self-similar. While we choose friends mainly on self-similarity of leisure and consumption (e.g, diet and exercise). Second, there might be an explanation based on transmission. We choose friends because we want them to influence us, while spouses are (supposed?) to accept us.


Your thoughts?
  
My thought:  No.  No no no no no.  No no no.  No.
 
From the linked paper:
  
A person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if h</p><p>4 0.13546561 <a title="1742-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-19-Believe_your_models_%28up_to_the_point_that_you_abandon_them%29.html">1269 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-19-Believe your models (up to the point that you abandon them)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a discussion of his variant of the write-a-thousand-words-a-day strategy (as he puts it, “a system for the production of academic results in writing”), Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
Believe the claims you are making. That is, confine yourself to making claims you believe. I always emphasize this when I [Basbøll] define knowledge as “justified, true belief”. . . . I think if there is one sure way to undermine your sense of your own genius it is to begin to say things you know to be publishable without being sure they are true. Or even things you know to be “true” but don’t understand well enough to believe.
  
He points out that this is not so easy:
  
In times when there are strong orthodoxies it can sometimes be difficult to know what to believe. Or, rather, it is all too easy to know what to believe (what the “right belief” is). It is therefore difficult to stick to statements of one’s own belief.

<p>Introduction: Statistics is the science of defaults.
 
One of the differences between statistics and other branches of engineering is that we have a special love for default procedures, perhaps because so many statistical problems are routine (or, at least, people would like them to be).  We have standard estimates for all sorts of models, books of statistical tests, and default settings for everything.  Recently I’ve been working on default weakly informative priors (which are  not  the same as the typically noninformative “reference priors” of the Bayesian literature).  From a Bayesian point of view, the appropriate default procedure could be defined as that which is appropriate for the population of problems that one might be studying.
 
More generally, much of our job as statisticians is to come up with methods that will be used by others in routine practice.  (Much of the rest of our job is to come up with methods for evaluating new and existing statistical methods, and methods for coming up wi</p><p>6 0.12439866 <a title="1742-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-06-Against_optimism_about_social_science.html">1844 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-06-Against optimism about social science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: “Explanation” is this thing that social scientists (or people in their everyday lives, acting like social scientists) do, where some event X happens and we supply a coherent story that concludes with X.  Sometimes we speak of an event as “overdetermined,” when we can think of many plausible stories that all lead to X.

To understand why this is a question worth asking at all, compare to prediction.

<p>Introduction: As a statistician I am particularly worried about the rhetorical power of anecdotes (even though I use them in my own reasoning; see discussion below).  But much can be learned from a  true  anecdote.  The rough edges—the places where the anecdote doesn’t fit your thesis—these are where you learn.
 
We have recently had a discussion ( here  and  here ) of Karl Weick, a prominent scholar of business management who plagiarized a story and then went on to draw different lessons from the pilfered anecdote in several different publications published over many years.
 
Setting aside an issues of plagiarism and rulebreaking, I argue that, by hiding the source of the story and changing its form, Weick and his management-science audience are losing their ability to get anything out of it beyond empty confirmation.
 
A full discussion follows.

<p>Introduction: In “Story:  A Definition,” visual analysis researcher Robert Kosara  writes :
  
A story

 
 ties facts together. There is a reason why this particular collection of facts is in this story, and the story gives you that reason. 
 provides a narrative path through those facts. In other words, it guides the viewer/reader through the world, rather than just throwing them in there. 
 presents a particular interpretation of those facts. A story is always a particular path through a world, so it favors one way of seeing things over all others. 
 
  
The relevance of these ideas to statistical graphics is apparent.
 
From a completely different direction, in “When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences,” Thomas Basbøll and I  write :
  
Storytelling has long been recognized as central to human cognition and communication.

It is therefore difficult to stick to statements of one’s own belief. I sometimes worry that our universities, which are systems of formal education and for</p><p>5 0.78585923 <a title="1742-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-17-Attractive_models_%28and_data%29_wanted_for_statistical_art_show..html">471 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-17-Attractive models (and data) wanted for statistical art show.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have agreed to do a local art exhibition in February. 
 
An excuse to think about form, colour and style for plotting almost individual observation likelihoods – while invoking the artists privilege of refusing to give interpretations of their own work.
 
In order to make it possibly less dry I’ll try to use intuitive suggestive captions like in this example  TheTyranyof13.pdf 
 
thereby side stepping the technical discussions like here  RadfordNealBlog 
 
Suggested models and data sets (or even submissions) would be most appreciated.
 
I likely be sticking to realism i.e. plots that represent ‘statistical reality’ faithfully.

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>3 0.95377493 <a title="1742-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-06-My_talk_at_Northwestern_University_tomorrow_%28Thursday%29.html">651 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-06-My talk at Northwestern University tomorrow (Thursday)</a></p>

Participants will build the communication skills that technical professionals need to express complex ideas to their peers, experts in other fields, and the general public.  There will be panel discussions on the following topics:


* Engaging Non-Scientific Audiences 
* Science Writing for a Cause 
* Communicating Science Through Fiction 
* Sharing Science with Scientists 
* The World of Non-Academic Publishing 
* Communicating using Multimedia and the Web


In addition to these discussions, ample time is allotted for interacting with the experts and with att</p><p>5 0.95291984 <a title="1742-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-10-Update_on_Levitt_paper_on_child_car_seats.html">1491 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-10-Update on Levitt paper on child car seats</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  noted  the following quote from applied microeconomist Steven Levitt:
  
Is it surprising that scientists would try to keep work that disagrees with their findings out of journals? When I told my father that I [Levitt] was sending my work saying car seats are not that effective to medical journals, he laughed and said they would never publish it because of the result, no matter how well done the analysis was. (As is so often the case, he was right, and I eventually published it in an economics journal.)


Within the field of economics, academics work behind the scenes constantly trying to undermine each other. I’ve seen economists do far worse things than pulling tricks in figures. When economists get mixed up in public policy, things get messier.
  
At the time, I expressed dismay about Levitt’s air of (as I read it) amused, world-weary tolerance of scientists behaving against the interest of science.  But I took his story about the car seats at face value.

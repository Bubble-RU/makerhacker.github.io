My problem with the notebook I have now is that the ink is too heavy—that is, the lines are too dark.  I want very faint lines, just visible enough to be used as guides but not so heavy that to be overwhelming.

I’ve been happily using R for a number of years now and recently came across Stan. Looks big and powerful, so I’d like to pick an appropriate project and try it out. I wondered if you could point me to a link or document that goes into the motivation for this tool (aside from the Stan user doc)?  What I’d like to understand is, at what point might you look at an emergent R project and advise, “You know, that thing you’re trying to do would be a whole lot easier/simpler/more straightforward to implement with Stan.” (or words to that effect).
  
My reply:  For my collaborators in political science, Stan has been most useful for models where the data set is not huge (e.g., we might have 10,000 data points or 50,000 data points but not 10 million) but where the model is somewhat complex (for example, a model with latent time series structure).

<p>Introduction: My C-oriented Stan collaborators have convinced me to use underscore (_) rather than dot (.) as much as possible in expressions in R.  For example, I can name a variable n_years rather than n.years.  This is fine.  But I’m getting annoyed because I need to press the shift key every time I type the underscore.
 
What do people do about this?  I know that it’s easy enough to reassign keys (I could, for example, assign underscore to backslash, which I never use).  I’m just wondering what C programmers actually do.  Do they reassign the key or do they just get used to pressing Shift?
 
P.S.  In comments, Ben Hyde  points  to Google’s R style guide, which recommends that variable names use dots,  not  underscore or camel case, for variable names (for example, “avg.clicks” rather than “avg_Clicks” or “avgClicks”).  I think they’re recommending this to be consistent with  R coding conventions .

<p>Introduction: OK, so this sort of thing happens sometimes.  I was working on a new idea (still working on it; if it ultimately works out—or if it doesn’t—I’ll let you know) and as part of it I was fitting little models in Stan, in a loop.  I thought it would make sense to start with linear regression with normal priors and known data variance, because then the exact solution is Gaussian and I can also work with the problem analytically.  So I programmed up the algorithm and, no surprise, it didn’t work.  I went through my R code, put in print statements here and there, and cleared out bug after bug until at least it stopped crashing.  But the algorithm still wasn’t doing what it was supposed to do.
 
So I decided to do something simpler, and just check that the Stan linear regression gave the same answer as the analytic posterior distribution:  I ran Stan for tons of iterations, then computed the sample mean and variance of the simulations.  It was an example with two coefficients—I’d originally cho</p><p>5 0.68693978 <a title="1716-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic%21.html">1580 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic!</a></p>

I’ve been translating a few ongoing data analysis projects into  Stan  code, mostly with success. The most important for me right now has been a hierarchical zero-inflated gamma problem. This a “hurdle” model, in which a bernoulli GLM produces zeros/nonzeros, and then a gamma GLM produces the nonzero values, using varying effects correlated with those in the bernoulli process.


The data are 20 years of human foraging returns from a subsistence hunting population in Paraguay (the Ache), comprising about 15k hunts in total (Hill & Kintigh. 2009. Current Anthropology 50:369-377). Observed values are kilograms of meat returned to camp. The more complex models contain a 147-by-9 matrix of varying effects (147 unique hunters), as well as imputation of missing values.


Originally, I had written the sampler myself in raw R code. It was very slow, but I knew what it was doing at least.

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.
  
Cool.  We’ll have to do that ex</p><p>4 0.78233135 <a title="1716-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing_hardware.html">214 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing hardware</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lyric Semiconductor   posted:
  

For over 60 years, computers have been based on digital computing principles. Data is represented as bits (0s and 1s). Boolean logic gates perform operations on these bits. A processor steps through many of these operations serially in order to perform a function. However, today’s most interesting problems are not at all suited to this approach.


Here at Lyric Semiconductor, we are redesigning information processing circuits from the ground up to natively process probabilities: from the gate circuits to the processor architecture to the programming language.  As a result, many applications that today require a thousand conventional processors will soon run in just one Lyric processor, providing 1,000x efficiencies in cost, power, and size.

Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

<p>Introduction: Nurit Baytch posted a document,  A Critique of Ron Unz’s Article “The Myth of American Meritocracy” , that is relevant to an ongoing discussion we had on this blog. Baytch’s article begins:
  
In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show. In addition, Unz’s arguments have proven to be untenable in light of a recent survey of incoming Harvard freshmen conducted by The Harvard Crimson, which found that students who identified as Jewish reported a mean SAT score of 2289</p><p>4 0.53238362 <a title="1768-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-28-Different_modes_of_discourse.html">1743 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-28-Different modes of discourse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.  Negotiation doesn</p><p>5 0.45315588 <a title="1768-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-12-That_claim_that_Harvard_admissions_discriminate_in_favor_of_Jews%3F__After_seeing_the_statistics%2C_I_don%E2%80%99t_see_it..html">1720 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-12-That claim that Harvard admissions discriminate in favor of Jews?  After seeing the statistics, I don’t see it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!

<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.
  
But these numbers are incorrect, as I learned from a professor of oncology at the Univ</p><p>6 0.89068407 <a title="1768-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-28-Different_modes_of_discourse.html">1743 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-28-Different modes of discourse</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Antonio Ramos writes:
  
The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.  Beyond that, I think there is good work in psychometrics on covaraince structures but I donâ&euro;&trade;t know the literature.</p><p>2 0.95336056 <a title="1768-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-An_Olympic_size_swimming_pool_full_of_lithium_water.html">179 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-An Olympic size swimming pool full of lithium water</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Hykel Hosni noticed  this bit  from the Lindley Prize page of the Society for Bayesan Analysis:
  
Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley’s move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: “it was as though a Jehovah’s Witness had been elected Pope.”
  
From my perspective, this was amusing (if commonplace):  a group of rationalists jocularly characterizing themselves as religious fanatics.  And some of this is in response to intense opposition from outsiders (see the Background section  here ).
 
That’s my view.  I’m an insider, a statistician who’s heard all jokes about religious Bayesians, from Bayesian and non-Bayesian statisticians alike.
 
But Hosni is an outsider, and here’s how he sees the above-quoted paragraph:

<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

<p>Introduction: Chris Wiggins writes of an interesting-looking summer program that undergraduate or graduate students can apply to:
  
The hackNY Fellows program is an initiative to mentor the next generation of technology innovators in New York, focusing on tech startups. Last summer’s  class of fellows  was paired with NYC startups which demonstrated they could provide a mentoring environment (a clear project, a person who could work with the Fellow, and sufficient stability to commit to 10 weeks of compensation for the Fellow).  hackNY, with the support of the Kauffman foundation and the Internet Society of New York, provided shared housing in NYU dorms in Union Square, and organized a series of pedagogical lectures. 


hackNY was founded by Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly, Evan Korth, professor of CS at NYU, and Chris Wiggins, professor of applied mathematics at Columbia.

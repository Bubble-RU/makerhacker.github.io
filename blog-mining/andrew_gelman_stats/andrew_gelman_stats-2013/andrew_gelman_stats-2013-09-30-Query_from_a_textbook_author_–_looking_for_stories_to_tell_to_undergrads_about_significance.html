<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics. 

       

 I can see how, from a statisti</p><p>5 0.10357914 <a title="2044-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-22-Going_Beyond_the_Book%3A_Towards_Critical_Reading_in_Statistics_Teaching.html">1023 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-22-Going Beyond the Book: Towards Critical Reading in Statistics Teaching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>6 0.10317632 <a title="2044-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-06-%E2%80%9CSampling%3A__Design_and_Analysis%E2%80%9D%3A__a_course_for_political_science_graduate_students.html">749 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-06-“Sampling:  Design and Analysis”:  a course for political science graduate students</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>6 0.70785743 <a title="2044-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-Evaluating_Columbia_University%E2%80%99s_Frontiers_of_Science_course.html">1864 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-Evaluating Columbia University’s Frontiers of Science course</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone sent me the following email:
  
I am an environmental journalist writing an Environmental Science 101 textbook and I’m currently working on the section on hypothesis testing and statistical significance. I am searching for a story to make the importance of thinking statistically come alive for the students, ideally one from the environmental sciences. I’m looking for a time when an effect seemed huge to the naked eye, but wasn’t or a time when an error made an insignificant result look significant. Or maybe a story about how the media took an insignificant relationship and blew it out of proportion. Or maybe a story, like the one you told so well recently in Slate, about how you can find “significance” if you just keep throwing enough mud at the wall. 


It could be old or new, obscure or well known. The key thing, to make it work for the textbook, is that it have consequences—either implications outside of science, or high drama inside science.

Ed Vul and I are working on something that, although less exciting than the struggle against voodoo correlations in fMRI :-) might interest you and your readers.  The background is this:  we have been struck for a long time by how many people get frustrated and confused trying to figure out whether something they are doing/eating/etc is triggering something bad, whether it be migraine headaches, children’s tantrums, arthritis pains, or whatever. It seems crazy to try to do such computations in one’s head–and the psychological literature suggests people must be pretty bad at this kind of thing–but what’s the alternative?  We are trying to develop one alternative approach–starting with migraine as a pilot project.


We created  a website  that migraine sufferers can sign up for. The users select a list of factors that they think might be triggering their headaches (eg drinking red wine, eating stinky cheese, etc.–the website suggests a big list of candidates drawn</p><p>4 0.92631102 <a title="2044-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-23-My_new_writing_strategy.html">727 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-23-My new writing strategy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In high school and college I would write long assignments using a series of outlines.  I’d start with a single sheet where I’d write down the key phrases, connect them with lines, and then write more and more phrases until the page was filled up.  Then I’d write a series of outlines, culminating in a sentence-level outline that was roughly one line per sentence of the paper.  Then I’d write.  It worked pretty well.  Or horribly, depending on how you look at it.  I was able to produce 10-page papers etc. on time.  But I think it crippled my writing style for years.  It’s taken me a long time to learn how to write directly–to explain clearly what I’ve done and why.  And I’m still working on the “why” part.  There’s a thin line between verbosity and terseness.
 
I went to MIT and my roommate was a computer science major.  He wrote me a word processor on his Atari 800, which did the job pretty well.  For my senior thesis I broke down and used the computers in campus.

<p>Introduction: I Paid a Bribe  by Janaagraha, a Bangalore based not-for-profit, harnesses the collective energy of citizens and asks them to report on the nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of corruption activities. These reports would be used to argue for improving governance systems and procedures, tightening law enforcement and regulation and thereby reduce the scope for corruption.
 
Here’s a presentation of data from the application: 
   
 
 
 Transparency International  could make something like this much more widely available around the  world .
 
While awareness is good, follow-up is even better. For example, it’s known that New York’s subway signal inspections  were being falsified . Signal inspections are pretty serious stuff, as failures lead to  disasters , such as the one in Washington. Nothing much happened after: the person responsible (making $163k a year) was merely  reassigned .</p><p>6 0.92030501 <a title="2044-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-02-At_least_he_didn%E2%80%99t_prove_a_false_theorem.html">741 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-02-At least he didn’t prove a false theorem</a></p>

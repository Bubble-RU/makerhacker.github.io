<p>Introduction: After seeing a document sent to me and others regarding the  crisis  of spurious, statistically-significant research findings in psychology research, I had the following reaction:
  
I am unhappy with the use in the document of the phrase “false positives.”  I feel that this expression is unhelpful as it frames science in terms of “true” and “false” claims, which I don’t think is particularly accurate.  In particular, in most of the recent disputed Psych Science type studies (the ESP study excepted, perhaps), there is little doubt that there is _some_ underlying effect.  The issue, as I see it, as that the underlying effects are much smaller, and much more variable, than mainstream researchers imagine.  So what happens is that Psych Science or Nature or whatever will publish a result that is purported to be some sort of universal truth, but it is actually a pattern specific to one data set, one population, and one experimental condition.

<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

<p>Introduction: John Cook  writes :
  
When I hear someone say “personalized medicine” I want to ask “as opposed to what?”


All medicine is personalized. If you are in an emergency room with a broken leg and the person next to you is lapsing into a diabetic coma, the two of you will be treated differently.


The aim of personalized medicine is to increase the degree of personalization, not to introduce personalization. . . .
  
This to me is a statistical way of thinking, to change an “Is it or isn’t it?” question into a “How much?” question.  This distinction arises in many settings but particularly in discussions of causal inference, for example  here  and  here , where I use the “statistical thinking” approach of imagining everything as being on some continuous scale, in contrast to computer scientist Elias Bareinboim and psychology researcher Steven Sloman, both of whom prefer what might be called the “civilian” or “common sense” idea that effects are either real or not, or that certain data can</p><p>5 0.15716586 <a title="1883-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-Write_This_Book.html">1605 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-Write This Book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>3 0.86139596 <a title="1883-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-23-Discussion_on_preregistration_of_research_studies.html">2183 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-23-Discussion on preregistration of research studies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Chambers and I had an enlightening discussion the other day at the blog of Rolf Zwaan, regarding the Garden of Forking Paths ( go here  and scroll down through the comments).
 
Chris sent me the following note:
  
I’m writing a book at the moment about reforming practices in psychological research (focusing on various bad practices such as p-hacking, HARKing, low statistical power, publication bias, lack of data sharing etc. – and posing solutions such as pre-registration, Bayesian hypothesis testing, mandatory data archiving etc.) and I am arriving at rather unsettling conclusion: that null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) simply isn’t valid for observational research. If this is true then most of the psychological literature is statistically flawed.


I was wonder what your thoughts were on this, both from a statistical point of view and from your experience working in an observational field.

<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham sent me  this , by Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes:
  
In this report we [Baggerly and Coombes] examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.
  
This is horrible!  But, in a way, it’s not surprising.  I make big mistakes in my applied work all the time.  I mean, all the time.  Sometimes I scramble the order of the 50 states, or I’m plotting a pure noise variable, or whatever.  But usually I don’t drift too far from reality because I have a lot of cross-checks and I (or my</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97280657 <a title="1883-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-04-Interrogating_p-values.html">1883 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-04-Interrogating p-values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article  is a discussion of a  paper  by Greg Francis for a special issue, edited by E. J. Wagenmakers, of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology.  Here’s what I wrote:
  
Much of statistical practice is an effort to reduce or deny variation and uncertainty. The reduction is done through standardization, replication, and other practices of experimental design, with the idea being to isolate and stabilize the quantity being estimated and then average over many cases. Even so, however, uncertainty persists, and statistical hypothesis testing is in many ways an endeavor to deny this, by reporting binary accept/reject decisions.


Classical statistical methods produce binary statements, but there is no reason to assume that the world works that way. Expressions such as Type 1 error, Type 2 error, false positive, and so on, are based on a model in which the world is divided into real and non-real effects. To put it another way, I understand the general scientific distinction of real vs</p><p>3 0.9712851 <a title="1883-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-19-Updated_solutions_to_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_homeworks.html">42 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-19-Updated solutions to Bayesian Data Analysis homeworks</a></p>

I wrote most of these in 1996, and I like them a lot.  I think several of them would’ve made good journal articles, and in retrospect I wish I’d published them as such.

<p>Introduction: After seeing  this recent discussion , Ezra Hauer sent along  an article of his  from the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention, describing three examples from accident research in which null hypothesis significance testing led researchers astray.  Hauer writes:
  
The problem is clear. Researchers obtain real data which, while noisy, time and again point in a certain direction. However, instead of saying: “here is my estimate of the safety effect, here is its precision, and this is how what I found relates to previous findings”, the data is processed by NHST, and the researcher says, correctly but pointlessly: “I cannot be sure that the safety effect is not zero”. Occasionally, the researcher adds, this time incorrectly and unjustifiably, a statement to the effect that: “since the result is not statistically significant, it is best to assume the safety effect to be zero”. In this manner, good data are drained of real content, the direction of empirical conclusions reversed, and ord</p><p>5 0.96496487 <a title="1883-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-01-Post-publication_peer_review%3A__How_it_%28sometimes%29_really_works.html">2004 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-01-Post-publication peer review:  How it (sometimes) really works</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an ideal world, research articles would be open to criticism and discussion in the same place where they are published, in a sort of non-corrupt version of Yelp.  What is happening now is that the occasional paper or research area gets lots of press coverage, and this inspires reactions on science-focused blogs.  The trouble here is that it’s easier to give off-the-cuff comments than detailed criticisms.
 
Here’s an example.  It starts a couple years ago with  this article  by Ryota Kanai, Tom Feilden, Colin Firth, and Geraint Rees, on brain size and political orientation:
  
In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants.

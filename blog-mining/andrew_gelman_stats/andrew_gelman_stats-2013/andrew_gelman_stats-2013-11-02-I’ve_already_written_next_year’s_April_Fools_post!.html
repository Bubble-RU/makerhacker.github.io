<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>3 0.12014803 <a title="2085-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-01-Non-topical_blogging.html">1964 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-01-Non-topical blogging</a></p>

What I do is post once a day; when I write new posts, I schedule them for the future.  I currently have approx 2-month lag.

<p>Introduction: People keep telling me that Sas isn’t as bad as everybody says, but then I see (from  Christian Robert ) this listing from the Sas website of “disadvantages in using Bayesian analysis”:
  
There is no correct way to choose a prior. Bayesian inferences require skills to translate prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior. If you do not proceed with caution, you can generate misleading results. . . . From a practical point of view, it might sometimes be difficult to convince subject matter experts who do not agree with the validity of the chosen prior.
  
That is so tacky! As if least squares, logistic regressions, Cox models, and all those other likelihoods mentioned in the Sas documentation are so automatically convincing to subject matter experts.
 
P.S.  For some more serious objections to Bayesian statistics, see  here  and  here .
 
P.P.S.  In case you’re wondering why I’m commenting on month-old blog entries . . .

<p>Introduction: I post (approximately) once a day and don’t plan to change that.
 
I have enough material to post more often—for example, I could intersperse existing blog posts with summaries of my published papers or of other work that I like; and, beyond this, we currently have a one-to-two-month backlog of posts—but I’m afraid that if the number of posts were doubled, the attention given to each would be roughly halved.
 
Looking at it the other way, I certainly don’t want to  reduce  my level of posting.  Sure, it takes time to blog, but these are things that are important for me to say.  If I were to blog less frequently, it would only be because I was pouring all these words into a different vessel, for example a book.  For now, though, I think it makes sense to blog and then collect the words later as appropriate.  With blogging I get comments, and many of these comments are helpful—either directly (by pointing out errors in my thinking or linking to relevant software or literature) or indirec</p><p>6 0.089737244 <a title="2085-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated%3A__A_place_to_post_your_statistics_questions.html">1061 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated:  A place to post your statistics questions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m trying to temporarily kick the blogging habit as I seem to be addicted.  I’m currently on a binge and my plan is to schedule a bunch of already-written entries at one per weekday and not blog anything new for awhile.
 
Yesterday I fell off the wagon and posted 4 items, but maybe now I can show some restraint.
 
P.S.  In keeping with the spirit of this blog, I scheduled it to appear on 13 May, even though I wrote it on 15 Apr.  Just about everything you’ve been reading on this blog for the past several weeks (and lots of forthcoming items) were written a month ago.  The only exceptions are whatever my cobloggers have been posting and various items that were timely enough that I inserted them in the queue afterward.
 
P.P.S  I bumped it up to 22 Jun because, as of 14 Apr, I was continuing to write new entries.  I hope to slow down soon!
 
P.P.P.S. (20 June) I was going to bump it up again–the horizon’s now in mid-July–but I thought, enough is enough!
 
Right now I think that about ha</p><p>4 0.76769745 <a title="2085-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-16-RSS_mess.html">91 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-16-RSS mess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Apparently some of our new blog entries are appearing as old entries on the RSS feed, meaning that those of you who read the blog using RSS may be missing a lot of good stuff.  We’re working on this.  But, in the meantime, I recommend you click on  the blog itself  to see what’s been posted in the last few weeks.  Enjoy.</p><p>5 0.7614817 <a title="2085-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-20-Why_I_blog%3F.html">220 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-20-Why I blog?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There is sometimes a line of news, a thought or an article sufficiently aligned with the general topics on this blog that is worth sharing. 
 
I could have emailed it to a few friends who are interested. Or I could have gone through the relative hassle of opening up the blog administration interface, cleaned it up a little, added some thoughts and made it pretty to post on the blog. And then itâ&euro;&trade;s poring through hundreds of spam messages, just to find two or three false positives in a thousand spams. Or, finding the links, ideas and comments reproduced on another blog without attribution or credit. Or, even, finding the whole blog mirrored on another website.
 
It might seem all work and no fun, but what keeps me coming back is your comments: the discussions, the additional links, information and insights you provide, this is what makes it all worthwhile. 
 
Thanks, those of you who are commenters! And let us know what would make your life easier.</p><p>6 0.70201707 <a title="2085-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Our_new_improved_blog%21__Thanks_to_Cord_Blomquist.html">856 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Our new improved blog!

<p>Introduction: I was just reading  an old post  and came across this example which I’d like to share with you again:
  
Here’s a story of R-squared = 1%. Consider a 0/1 outcome with about half the people in each category. For.example, half the people with some disease die in a year and half live. Now suppose there’s a treatment that increases survival rate from 50% to 60%. The unexplained sd is 0.5 and the explained sd is 0.05, hence R-squared is 0.01.</p><p>4 0.92125672 <a title="2085-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-%E2%80%A6pretty_soon_you%E2%80%99re_talking_real_money..html">68 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-…pretty soon you’re talking real money.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  New York Times article  reports the opening of a half-mile section of bike path, recently built along the west side of Manhattan at a cost of $16M, or roughly $30 million per mile.  That’s about $5700 per linear foot.  Kinda sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?   
 
Well, $30 million per mile for about one car-lane mile is a lot, but it’s not out of line compared to other urban highway construction costs.  The Doyle Drive project in San Francisco — a freeway to replace the current old and deteriorating freeway approach to the Golden Gate Bridge — is currently under way at $1 billion for 1.6 miles…but hey, it will have six lanes each way, so that isn’t so bad, at $50 million per lane-mile.  And there are other components to the project, too, not just building the highway (there will also be bike paths, landscaping, on- and off-ramps, and so on).  All in all it seems roughly in line with the New York bike lane project.
 
Speaking of the Doyle Drive project, one expense was the cost of movin</p><p>5 0.91894472 <a title="2085-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-An_IV_won%E2%80%99t_save_your_life_if_the_line_is_tangled.html">550 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-An IV won’t save your life if the line is tangled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  See section 4 of  this article .
 
More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

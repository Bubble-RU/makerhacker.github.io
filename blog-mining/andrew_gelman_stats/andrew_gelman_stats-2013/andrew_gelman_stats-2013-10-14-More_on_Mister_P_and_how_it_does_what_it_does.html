It was nice to see our article mentioned and discussed by Andrew, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza on Andrew’s blog in this post on Wednesday.  As noted in the post, we recently published an  article  in Political Analysis on how well multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) performs at producing estimates of state opinion with conventional national surveys where N≈1,500.  Our central claims are that (i) the performance of MRP is highly variable, (ii) in the absence of knowing the true values, it is difficult to determine the quality of the MRP estimates produced on the basis of a single national sample, and, (iii) therefore, our views about the usefulness of MRP in instances where a researcher has a single sample of N≈1,500 are less optimistic than the ones expressed in previous research on the topic.

[sent-2, score-0.627]
</p><p>2 The question that motivated our article was this:  With a national sample of 1,500 respondents can a researcher be confident that MRP will produce “good” state-level estimates of opinion? [sent-10, score-0.649]
</p><p>3 If we have read the blog posts correctly, then there is agreement among us all that a researcher should not assume that MRP will perform well and instead the MRP estimates ought to be validated. [sent-11, score-0.431]
</p><p>4 One is: In the absence of knowing true state opinion, is it possible to validate and assess the quality of the MRP estimates? [sent-13, score-0.499]
</p><p>5 (Our Monte Carlo simulations, discussed in the article, also suggest that the relationship between interstate variation and intrastate variation in opinion is also important for MRP performance. [sent-21, score-0.319]
</p><p>6 If one knew true opinion across the states, then it would be easy to assess the quality of the state-level predictors. [sent-25, score-0.531]
</p><p>7 But, if the researcher knew true opinion across the states, then the researcher would not be trying to estimate it by applying MRP to a sample of 1,500 respondents. [sent-26, score-0.723]
</p><p>8 So, with only a sample of 1,500 respondents – the situation that applied researchers will find themselves in – is there a valid and reliable way to determine if one has good state-level predictors? [sent-27, score-0.276]
</p><p>9 Assessing the quality of the state-level predictors would be less important if the state-level predictors were only rarely “not good” or if MRP (for whatever reason) only rarely produced low quality estimates. [sent-30, score-0.434]
</p><p>10 Previous analyses of MRP do not show how its performance varies across different samples drawn from the same population to estimate the same opinion. [sent-33, score-0.281]
</p><p>11 But as we show in the figures in our article, variability is evident when we look across different samples for the same opinion and across opinions. [sent-34, score-0.47]
</p><p>12 If one agrees with Ghitza and his assertion that measuring “true” preferences with MRP does not lead to overestimating the performance and consistency of MRP with small samples, then there is less actual variation in MRP performance than the amount we report in our article. [sent-36, score-0.353]
</p><p>13 ”   Put another way, based on the results reported in Ghitza’s figure, could a researcher who has produced state opinion estimates with MRP from a sample of 1,500 respondents be confident that MRP has performed well? [sent-38, score-0.86]
</p><p>14 After drawing a sample of 1,500 and estimating the multilevel model of opinion on it, we produced state estimates based on the predictions from the multilevel model, weighted by the “census” weights. [sent-45, score-0.688]
</p><p>15 Consider the question that motivated our article: How confident should a researcher who only has a single national survey sample of 1,500 (or even 3,000) respondents be in the MRP estimates of state opinion produced with it? [sent-52, score-0.923]
</p><p>16 Setting aside our article, the only other published studies that assess MRP performance with samples like these are Lax and Phillips (2009) and  Warshaw and Rodden (2012) . [sent-53, score-0.305]
</p><p>17 And, Warshaw and Rodden (2012) do find what we would call nontrivial variation in average MRP performance across items (look at the MRP entries for the six opinion items when N=2,500 in their  Figure 5 ; we highlighted the relevant entries. [sent-55, score-0.436]
</p><p>18 )  On the basis of Lax and Phillips (2009) and Warshaw and Rodden (2012), then, we would not draw the inference that MRP will consistently and routinely perform well across different opinions or even for the same opinion at different points in time. [sent-56, score-0.416]
</p><p>19 The investigations of MRP performance that preceded ours – and ours, too – all assess the quality of the estimates by comparing them to “true” values. [sent-58, score-0.448]
</p><p>20 In the absence of knowing the true values we do not see how the researcher could determine how “good” or “bad” the MRP estimates are, and we would therefore hesitate to use them. [sent-59, score-0.631]

<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science—and soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It’s taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power—as well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.
 
As a method becomes used more and more widely, there will be natural concerns about its domains of applicability.

<p>Introduction: Ben Highton and Matt Buttice point us to  this response  addressing some of the issues Jeff Lax  raised  in his most recent MRP post.
 
P.S.  Jeff replies in comments:
  
It sounds like we’ve converged. They acknowledge MRP performance is significantly better on average than reported in their new paper in PA and yet performance variation in terms of correlation to “truth” remains higher than some might have thought.
  
Cool.  I hope this sort of blog exchange can be a model of scientific discussion.  Instead of a paper just sitting there by itself, it can be openly explored.  Ideally, the published paper would include a link to these discussions of Highton, Buttice, Lax, Phillips, and Ghitza, so that readers would automatically get all this information.</p><p>5 0.30616155 <a title="2061-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>6 0.2635451 <a title="2061-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-Question_26_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1367 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-Question 26 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

It sounds like we’ve converged. They acknowledge MRP performance is significantly better on average than reported in their new paper in PA and yet performance variation in terms of correlation to “truth” remains higher than some might have thought.
  
Cool.  I hope this sort of blog exchange can be a model of scientific discussion.  Instead of a paper just sitting there by itself, it can be openly explored.  Ideally, the published paper would include a link to these discussions of Highton, Buttice, Lax, Phillips, and Ghitza, so that readers would automatically get all this information.</p><p>5 0.76273239 <a title="2061-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>6 0.67524523 <a title="2061-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-17-Distorting_the_Electoral_Connection%3F_Partisan_Representation_in_Confirmation_Politics.html">152 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-17-Distorting the Electoral Connection?

<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.
 
I guess what I’m saying is:</p><p>2 0.9640013 <a title="2061-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above is the title of  a talk  that Thad Tarpey gave at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2009.  Here’s the abstract:
  
Students of statistics are often introduced to George Box’s famous quote: “all models are wrong, some are useful.” In this talk I [Tarpey] argue that this quote, although useful, is wrong. A different and more positive perspective is to acknowledge that a model is simply a means of extracting information of interest from data. The truth is infinitely complex and a model is merely an approximation to the truth. If the approximation is poor or misleading, then the model is useless. In this talk I give examples of correct models that are not true models. I illustrate how the notion of a “wrong” model can lead to wrong conclusions.
  
I’m curious what he had to say—maybe he could post the slides?

<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?

<p>Introduction: Following up on  our discussion  the other day, Matt Buttice and Ben Highton write:
  
It was nice to see our article mentioned and discussed by Andrew, Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza on Andrew’s blog in this post on Wednesday.  As noted in the post, we recently published an  article  in Political Analysis on how well multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) performs at producing estimates of state opinion with conventional national surveys where N≈1,500.  Our central claims are that (i) the performance of MRP is highly variable, (ii) in the absence of knowing the true values, it is difficult to determine the quality of the MRP estimates produced on the basis of a single national sample, and, (iii) therefore, our views about the usefulness of MRP in instances where a researcher has a single sample of N≈1,500 are less optimistic than the ones expressed in previous research on the topic.

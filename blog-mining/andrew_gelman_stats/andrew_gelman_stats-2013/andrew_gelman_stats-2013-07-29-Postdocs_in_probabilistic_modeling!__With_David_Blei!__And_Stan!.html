<p>Introduction: If you need an excuse to go skiing in Tahoe next month, our paper on Stan as a probabilistic programming language was accepted for:
  
  Workshop on Probabilistic Programming  
NIPS 2012 
7–8 December, 2012, Lake Tahoe, Nevada
   
The workshop is organized by the folks behind the probabilistic programming language  Church  and has a great lineup of invited speakers (Chris Bishop, Josh Tennenbaum, and Stuart Russell).  And in case you’re interested in the main conference, here’s the list of accepted  NIPS 2012 papers and posters .

<p>Introduction: We’re working with polling company YouGov to track public opinion, state-by-state and district-by-district, during the 2014 campaign.  We’ll be using multilevel regression and poststratification, and implementing it in Stan, and developing the necessary new parts of Stan to get this running scalably and efficiently.  And we’ll be making the most detailed, up-to-date election forecasts.
 
What you’ll be doing if you join us as a postdoc: 
- You’ll be in the midst of the most advanced polling team anywhere; 
- You’ll be doing cutting-edge statistical research on MRP with deep interactions; 
- You’ll be doing basic research in statistical computing, developing fast and scalable deterministic and stochastic algorithms for fitting multilevel models; 
- You’ll be working inside Stan, the most advanced general computational framework for Bayesian analysis. 
 We’re doing research, not just implementing existing methods.

<p>Introduction: Statistical Methods and Data Skepticism 
  
Data analysis today is dominated by three paradigms:  null hypothesis significance testing, Bayesian inference, and exploratory data analysis.  There is concern that all these methods lead to overconfidence on the part of researchers and the general public, and this concern has led to the new “data skepticism” movement.


But the history of statistics is already in some sense a history of data skepticism.  Concepts of bias, variance, sampling and measurement error, least-squares regression, and statistical significance can all be viewed as formalizations of data skepticism.  All these methods address the concern that patterns in observed data might not generalize to the population of interest.


We discuss the challenge of attaining data skepticism while avoiding data nihilism, and consider some proposed future directions.

The Department of Mental Health invites applications for a post-doctoral research fellow in Statistical Methods for Mental Health Research, to be supervised by Dr. Elizabeth Stuart.  The successful applicant for this position will work on an NIH funded study to develop and evaluate propensity score methods when the covariates are measured with error, or when datasets contain similar, but not identical, measures of covariates of interest.  The post-doc will work with a team of researchers on development of new statistical methods, analysis of existing data, Monte Carlo simulations, and will take the lead on scientific publications.  Opportunities will be provided for training in causal inference, missing data, latent variable methods, the evaluation of statistical methods, and the application of statistics to mental health and education.

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.

<p>Introduction: 1.  Freakonomics  characterizes  drunk driving as an example of “the human tendency to worry about rare problems that are unlikely to happen.”
 
2.  The CDC  reports , “Alcohol-impaired drivers are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.”
 
No offense to the tenured faculty at the University of Chicago, but I’m going with the CDC on this one. 
   
P.S.  The Freakonomics blog deserves to be dinged another time, not just for claiming, based on  implausible assumptions  and making the all-else-equal  fallacy  that “drunk walking is 8 times more likely to result in your death than drunk driving” but for presenting this weak inference as a fact rather than as a speculation.
 
When doing “Freakonomics,” you can be counterintuitive, or you can be sensible, but it’s hard to be both. I mean, sure, sometimes you can be. But there’s a tradeoff, and in this case, they’re choosing to push the envelope on counterintuitiveness.</p><p>3 0.94658619 <a title="1961-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Question_21_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1356 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Question 21 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions.. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
 
 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>4 0.93926144 <a title="1961-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-20-Problemen_met_het_boek.html">1332 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-20-Problemen met het boek</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regarding the so-called Dutch Book argument for Bayesian inference (the idea that, if your inferences do not correspond to a Bayesian posterior distribution, you can be forced to make incoherent bets and ultimately become a money pump), I wrote:
 
I have never found this argument appealing, because a bet is a game not a decision.  A bet requires 2 players, and one player has to offer the bets.  I do agree that in some bounded settings (for example, betting on win place show in a horse race), I’d want my bets to be coherent; if they are incoherent (e.g., if my bets correspond to P(A|B)*P(B) not being equal to P(A,B)), then I should be able to do better by examining the incoherence.  But in an “open system” (to borrow some physics jargon), I don’t think coherence is possible.  There is always new information coming in, and there is always additional prior information in reserve that hasn’t entered the model.</p><p>5 0.92979288 <a title="1961-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-30-Systematic_review_of_publication_bias_in_studies_on_publication_bias.html">1291 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-30-Systematic review of publication bias in studies on publication bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>6 0.92856622 <a title="1961-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-%E2%80%9CCity_Opens_Inquiry_on_Grading_Practices_at_a_Top-Scoring_Bronx_School%E2%80%9D.html">529 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-“City Opens Inquiry on Grading Practices at a Top-Scoring Bronx School”</a></p>

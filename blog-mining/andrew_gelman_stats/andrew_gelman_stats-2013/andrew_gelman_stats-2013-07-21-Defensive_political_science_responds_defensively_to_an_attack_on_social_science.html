<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points us to  a discussion in Statistics in Medicine  of the  famous claims  by Christakis and Fowler on the contagion of obesity etc.
 
 
 
 James O’Malley  and  Christakis and Fowler  present the positive case.
 
 Andrew Thomas  and  Tyler VanderWeele  present constructive criticism.
 
Christakis and Fowler  reply .
 
Coincidentally, a couple weeks ago an epidemiologist was explaining to me the differences between the Framingham Heart Study and the Nurses Health Study and why Framingham got the postmenopausal supplement risks right while Nurses got it wrong.
 
P.S.  The journal issue also includes a comment on “A distribution-free test of constant mean in linear mixed effects models.”  Wow!  I had no idea people still did this sort of thing.  How horrible.  But I guess that’s what half-life is all about.  These ideas last forever, they just become less and less relevant to people.</p><p>5 0.13119729 <a title="1949-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.

I will restrict my discussion to social science examples. Social scientists are often tempted to illustrate their ideas with examples from medical research. When it comes to medicine, though, we are, with rare exceptions, at best ignorant laypersons (in my case, not even reaching that level), and it is my impression that by reaching for medical analogies we are implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes. Evidence-based medicine is the subject of a large literature of its own (see, for example, Lau, Ioannidis, and Schmid, 1998).</p><p>4 0.78668433 <a title="1949-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-21-Responding_to_a_bizarre_anti-social-science_screed.html">1335 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-21-Responding to a bizarre anti-social-science screed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philosophy professor Gary Gutting  writes :
  
Public policy debates often involve appeals to results of work in social sciences like economics and sociology. . . . How much authority should we give to such work in our policy decisions? . . . The core natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) are so well established that we readily accept their best-supported conclusions as definitive. . . . But how reliable is even the best work on the effects of teaching?  How, for example, does it compare with the best work by biochemists on the effects of light on plant growth? Since humans are much more complex than plants and biochemists have far more refined techniques for studying plants, we may well expect the biochemical work to be far more reliable. . . . While the physical sciences produce many detailed and precise predictions, the social sciences do not.
  
OK, fine.  But then comes the punchline:

Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis, a medical scientist perhaps best known for his  controversial  claim (see also  here ), based on joint work with James Fowler, that obesity is contagious,  writes : 
  
  
The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .


I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics.

<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . .

There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.
  
I  disagreed , saying that Christakis wasn’t giving social science research enough credit:
  
I’m no economist so I can let others discuss the bit about “monopoly power is bad for markets.” I assume that the study by</p><p>3 0.98331648 <a title="1949-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-13-Lame_Statistics_Patents.html">1761 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-13-Lame Statistics Patents</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manoel Galdino wrote in a comment off-topic on another post (which I erased):
  

I know you commented before about patents on statistical methods. Did you know this patent ( http://www.archpatent.com/patents/8032473 )? Do you have any comment on patents that don’t describe mathematically how it works and how and if they’re any different from previous methods? And what about the lack of scientific validation of the claims in such a method?

  
The patent in question, “US 8032473: “Generalized reduced error logistic regression method,” begins with the following “claim”:
  

A system for machine learning comprising: a computer including a computer-readable medium having software stored thereon that, when executed by said computer, performs a method comprising the steps of being trained to learn a logistic regression match to a target class variable so to exhibit classification learning by which: an estimated error in each variable’s moment in the logistic regression be modeled and reduce</p><p>4 0.98271459 <a title="1949-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-07-Small_world%3A__MIT%2C_asymptotic_behavior_of_differential-difference_equations%2C_Susan_Assmann%2C_subgroup_analysis%2C_multilevel_modeling.html">507 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-07-Small world:  MIT, asymptotic behavior of differential-difference equations, Susan Assmann, subgroup analysis, multilevel modeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague recently sent me a copy of some articles on the estimation of treatment interactions (a topic that’s interested me for awhile).  One of the articles, which appeared in the Lancet in 2000, was called “ Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials ,” by Susan F. Assmann, Stuart J. Pocock, Laura E. Enos, and Linda E. Kasten. . . . 
 
Hey, wait a minute–I know Susan Assmann!  Well, I sort of know her.  When I was a freshman in college, I asked my adviser, who was an applied math prof, if I could do some research.  He connected me to Susan, who was one of his Ph.D. students, and she gave me a tiny part of her thesis to work on.
 
The problem went as follows.  You have a function f(x), for x going from 0 to infinity, that is defined as follows.  Between 0 and 1, f(x)=x.  Then, for x higher than 1, f’(x) = f(x) – f(x-1).  The goal is to figure out what f(x) does.  I think I’m getting this right here, but I might be getting confused on some of the detai</p><p>5 0.98149586 <a title="1949-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-30-More_on_the_correlation_between_statistical_and_political_ideology.html">638 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-30-More on the correlation between statistical and political ideology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a chance for me to combine two of my interests–politics and statistics–and probably to irritate both halves of the readership of this blog.  Anyway…
 
I recently  wrote  about the apparent correlation between Bayes/non-Bayes statistical ideology and liberal/conservative political ideology:
  
The Bayes/non-Bayes fissure had a bit of a political dimension–with anti-Bayesians being the old-line conservatives (for example, Ronald Fisher) and Bayesians having a more of a left-wing flavor (for example, Dennis Lindley). Lots of counterexamples at an individual level, but my impression is that on average the old curmudgeonly, get-off-my-lawn types were (with some notable exceptions) more likely to be anti-Bayesian.
  
This was somewhat based on my experiences at Berkeley.  Actually, some of the cranky anti-Bayesians were probably Democrats as well, but when they were being anti-Bayesian they seemed pretty conservative.

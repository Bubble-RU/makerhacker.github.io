<p>Introduction: When linking to my  review  of Duncan Watts’s book in a recent post, I came across some fun bits that I’d like to share (for those of you who didn’t just click through and read the whole thing):
 
On business books:
  
I’m not so interested in the business angle but I suppose that’s how you sell books these days. The business part of the book was ok—I’m not saying it was filler—it’s just that I’m not particularly interested in which format of videocassette wins, or whether Cisco Systems is a well-run company. I realize that a lot of people care about this sort of things nowadays, but I’d rather talk about sports or politics.
  
On dodgy science writer John Gribbin:
  
Sure, people write all sorts of silly things but usually they have some sort of political or religious excuse for why it’s ok to believe them. Truth is not the only important value in life, there are also other concerns such as political convictions, religious beliefs, and the simple desire to avoid offending people.

<p>Introduction: I was reading a book of Alfred Kazin’s letters—I don’t know if they’d be so interesting to someone who hadn’t already read a bunch of his  stuff , but I found them pretty interesting—and came across this amazing bit, dated August 11, 1957:
 
 
 
No, really, Al.  Tell us what you really feel.  This was in his private diary, so I can’t really criticize him for it.  And all of us have private thoughts, sometimes publicly expressed, that are unworthy of our better self.  For example, once I was crossing a street and a taxi driver came dangerously close, and I screamed at him, “Go back to your own country, you #&@#%*^&.”  So I’m not claiming that I’m any better than Kazin.  I just thought that quote was pretty amazing.  I guess that’s how (some) people thought, back in the fifties.
 
Also interesting that he wrote “ass-hole” in that context.  The hyphen surprised me, also I don’t think people would use that word in this way anymore.  Nowadays I think of an asshole as a person, not a place.</p><p>4 0.10128544 <a title="1935-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-14-Oswald_evidence.html">2134 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-14-Oswald evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin writes:
  
 This story  is interesting in its own right . . .  I have a question so I thought I would ask a Bayesian statistician.


One fact I learned on reading this article is that Oswald had a job in the building that Kennedy drove by before Kennedy’s route was chosen. So Oswald didn’t get the job to shoot Kennedy. Does this “prove” there was no conspiracy or indeed have any bearing on the likelihood of that inference?
  
My reply:  I actually have a friend whose father worked on the Warren Commission so I’ve long been convinced that Oswald acted alone.
 
But, sure, this piece of information should shift the probability a bit.  The difficulty is that the amount (and even the direction) of the shifting of the probability depends on the model you are assuming for various possibilities, and these possibilities themselves are not so clearly defined.  Bayesian statistician Jay Kadane wrote a book a few years ago on the Sacco and Vanzetti case, going into the evidence supplie</p><p>5 0.095353819 <a title="1935-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-06-Twitteo_killed_the_bloggio_star_._._._Not%21.html">841 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-06-Twitteo killed the bloggio star . . .

<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.
 
The scary part, though, was how the casino company craftily enabled her to</p><p>3 0.80787283 <a title="1935-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Alfred_Kahn.html">487 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Alfred Kahn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Appointed “inflation czar” in late 1970s, Alfred Kahn is  most famous  for deregulating the airline industry.  At the time this seemed to make sense, although in retrospect I’m less a fan of consumer-driven policies than I used to be.  When I was a kid we subscribed to Consumer Reports and so I just assumed that everything that was good for the consumer–lower prices, better products, etc.–was a good thing.  Upon reflection, though, I think it’s a mistake to focus too narrowly on the interests of consumers.  For example (from  my Taleb review  a couple years ago):
  
The discussion on page 112 of how Ralph Nader saved lives (mostly via seat belts in cars) reminds me of his car-bumper campaign in the 1970s. My dad subscribed to Consumer Reports then (he still does, actually, and I think reads it for pleasure–it must be one of those Depression-mentality things), and at one point they were pushing heavily for the 5-mph bumpers. Apparently there was some federal regulation about how strong</p><p>4 0.80478752 <a title="1935-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-03-The_statistical_properties_of_smart_chains_%28and_referral_chains_more_generally%29.html">1882 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-03-The statistical properties of smart chains (and referral chains more generally)</a></p>

The premise of  the column  this guy is starting is interesting:  Noah Davis interviews a smart person and then interviews the smartest person that smart person knows and so on. 


It reminded me of you mentioning survey design strategy of asking people about other people, like “How many people do you know named Stuart?” or “How many people do you know that have had an abortion?”


Ignoring the interview aspect of what this guy is doing, I think there’s some cool questions about the distribution/path behavior of smartest-person-I-know chains (say, seeded at random).  Do they loop?  If so, how long do they run before looping, how large are the loops?  What parts of the population do the explore?  Do you know of anything that’s been done on something like this?
  
My reply:  Interesting question.  It could be asked of any referral chain, for example asking a sequence of people, “Who’s the tallest person you know?” or “Who’s the best piano player you know” or “Who’</p><p>5 0.80079979 <a title="1935-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-04-Tesla_fires%21.html">2123 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-04-Tesla fires!</a></p>

I hadn’t heard about this at all!  I mean, sure, I’d heard of Tesla, this is an electric car being built by some  eccentric billionaire .  But I didn’t know they were catching on fire!  At this point I  was  curious so I followed the link.
 
It was an interesting discussion to read, partly because some of the commenters were so open about their financial interests;  for example ,

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.
 
I’m guessing that the taxi driver quoted above is subject to the same illusions</p><p>2 0.87947452 <a title="1935-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-21-Least_surprising_headline_of_the_year.html">919 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-21-Least surprising headline of the year</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>4 0.71477115 <a title="1935-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-21-%E2%80%9CReadability%E2%80%9D_as_freedom_from_the_actual_sensation_of_reading.html">1179 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-21-“Readability” as freedom from the actual sensation of reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.
  
Well put.  I wish Pierpoint would come out with ano</p><p>5 0.7129817 <a title="1935-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-02-At_least_he_didn%E2%80%99t_prove_a_false_theorem.html">741 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-02-At least he didn’t prove a false theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Siobhan Mattison pointed me to  this .  I’m just disappointed they didn’t use my  Fenimore Cooper  line.  Although I guess that reference wouldn’t resonate much outside the U.S.
 
P.S.  My guess was correct   See comments below.  Actually, the reference probably wouldn’t resonate so well among under-50-year-olds in the U.S. either.  Sort of like the Jaycees story.</p><p>6 0.70346189 <a title="1935-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-03-Bribing_statistics.html">500 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-03-Bribing statistics</a></p>

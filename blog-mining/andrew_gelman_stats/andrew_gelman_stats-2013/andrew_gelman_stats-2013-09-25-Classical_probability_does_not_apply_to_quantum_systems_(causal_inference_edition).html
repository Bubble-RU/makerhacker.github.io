<p>Introduction: I read  this article  by Rivka Galchen on quantum computing.  Much of the article was about an eccentric scientist in his fifties named David Deutch.  I’m sure the guy is brilliant but I wasn’t particularly interested in his not particularly interesting life story (apparently he’s thin and lives in Oxford).  There was a brief description of quantum computing itself, which reminds me of the discussion we had a couple years ago under the heading,  The laws of conditional probability are false  (and the update  here ).
 
I don’t have anything new to say here; I’d just never heard of quantum computing before and it seemed relevant to our discussion.  The uncertainty inherent in quantum computing seems closely related to Jouni’s idea of  fully Bayesian computing , that uncertainty should be inherent in the computational structure rather than tacked on at the end.
 
P.S.  No, I’m not working on July 4th!  This post is two months old, we just have a long waiting list of blog entries.</p><p>3 0.20508467 <a title="2037-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Applying_quantum_probability_to_political_science.html">877 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Applying quantum probability to political science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:

<p>Introduction: Several months ago, Mike Betancourt and I wrote a discussion for the article, Can quantum probability provide a new direction for cognitive modeling?, by Emmanuel Pothos and Jerome Busemeyer, in Behavioral and Brain Sciences.  We didn’t say much, but it was a milestone for me because, with this article, BBS became the 100th journal I’d published in.
 
Anyway, the full article with its 34 discussions just appeared  in the journal .   Here  it is.
 
What surprised me, in reading the full discussion, was how supportive the commentary was.  Given the topic of Pothos and Busemeyer’s article, I was expecting the discussions to range from gentle mockery to outright abuse.  The discussion that Mike and I wrote was moderately encouraging, and I was expecting this to fall on the extreme positive end of the spectrum.
 
Actually, though, most of the discussions were positive, and only a couple were purely negative (those would be “Quantum models of cognition as Orwellian newspeak” by Michael Lee a</p><p>5 0.15925573 <a title="2037-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-24-In_which_I_side_with_Neyman_over_Fisher.html">1869 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-24-In which I side with Neyman over Fisher</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a data analyst and a scientist, Fisher > Neyman, no question.  But as a theorist, Fisher came up with ideas that worked just fine in his applications but can fall apart when people try to apply them too generally.
 
Here’s an example that recently came up.
 
Deborah Mayo pointed me to a  comment  by Stephen Senn on the so-called Fisher and Neyman null hypotheses.  In an experiment with n participants (or, as we used to say, subjects or experimental units), the Fisher null hypothesis is that the treatment effect is exactly 0 for every one of the n units, while the Neyman null hypothesis is that the individual treatment effects can be negative or positive but have an average of zero.
 
Senn explains why Neyman’s hypothesis in general makes no sense—the short story is that Fisher’s hypothesis seems relevant in some problems (sometimes we really are studying effects that are zero or close enough for all practical purposes), whereas Neyman’s hypothesis just seems weird (it’s implausible</p><p>6 0.12456185 <a title="2037-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties_with_Bayesian_model_averaging.html">754 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties with Bayesian model averaging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lee Sechrest sends along  this article  by Brian Haig and writes that it “presents what seems to me a useful perspective on much of what scientists/statisticians do and how science works, at least in the fields in which I work.”  Here’s Haig’s abstract: 
  
  
A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

<p>Introduction: Commenter Wonks Anonymous  writes :
  
After the recent EconNobel announcement I decided to check Dimensional’s Fama-French blog to see if it had much new content recently, and while it was dissapointingly sparse it did have an interesting bit where Fama linked to the  best advice he’d ever gotten , from his statistics professor Harry Roberts:

 
With formal statistics, you say something — a hypothesis — and then you test it. Harry always said that your criterion should be not whether or not you can reject or accept the hypothesis, but what you can learn from the data. The best thing you can do is use the data to enhance your description of the world.
 
  
I responded:  That’s a great quote. Except that I disagree with what Fama says about “formal statistics.” Or, should I say, he has an old-fashioned view of formal statistics. (See  this paper  by X and me for some discussion of old-fashioned views.)

<p>Introduction: James Robins, Tyler VanderWeele, and Richard Gill  write :
  
Neyman introduced a formal mathematical theory of counterfactual causation that now has become standard language in many quantitative disciplines, but not in physics. We use results on causal interaction and interference between treatments (derived under the Neyman theory) to give a simple new proof of a well-known result in quantum physics, namely, Bellís inequality.


Now the predictions of quantum mechanics and the results of experiment both violate Bell’s inequality. In the remainder of the talk, we review the implications for a counterfactual theory of causation. Assuming with Einstein that faster than light (supraluminal) communication is not possible, one can view the Neyman theory of counterfactuals as falsified by experiment. . . .


Is it safe for a quantitative discipline to rely on a counterfactual approach to causation, when our best confirmed physical theory falsifies their existence?

<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.
 
Now consider how</p><p>3 0.93980253 <a title="2037-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-26-%E2%80%9CA_Vast_Graveyard_of_Undead_Theories%3A__Publication_Bias_and_Psychological_Science%E2%80%99s_Aversion_to_the_Null%E2%80%9D.html">1826 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-26-“A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories:  Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>4 0.93806982 <a title="2037-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-30-David_Hogg_on_statistics.html">1401 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-30-David Hogg on statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data :
  
We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation</p><p>5 0.93485928 <a title="2037-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

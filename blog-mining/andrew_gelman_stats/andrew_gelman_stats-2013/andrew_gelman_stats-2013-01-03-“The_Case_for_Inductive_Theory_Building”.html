<p>Introduction: Jonathan Livengood writes:
  
I have a couple of questions on your paper with Cosma Shalizi on “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics.”


First, you distinguish between inductive approaches and hypothetico-deductive approaches to inference and locate statistical practice (at least, the practice of model building and checking) on the hypothetico-deductive side.  Do you think that there are any interesting elements of statistical practice that are properly inductive?  For example, suppose someone is playing around with a system that more or less resembles a toy model, like drawing balls from an urn or some such, and where the person has some well-defined priors.  The person makes a number of draws from the urn and applies Bayes theorem to get a posterior.  On your view, is that person making an induction?  If so, how much space is there in statistical practice for genuine inductions like this?


Second, I agree with you that one ought to distinguish induction from other kind</p><p>4 0.17509332 <a title="1652-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-23-Philosophy%3A__Pointer_to_Salmon.html">1181 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-23-Philosophy:  Pointer to Salmon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.

<p>Introduction: Here’s an article  that I believe is flat-out entertaining to read.  It’s about philosophy, so it’s supposed to be entertaining, in any case.
 
Here’s the abstract:
  
A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.

<p>Introduction: Josh Tenenbaum describes some new work modeling people’s physical reasoning as probabilistic inferences over intuitive theories of mechanics. 
  
A general-purpose capacity for “physical intelligence”—inferring physical properties of objects and predicting future states in complex dynamical scenes—is central to how humans interpret their environment and plan safe and effective actions.  The computations and representations underlying physical intelligence remain unclear, however. Cognitive studies have focused on mapping out judgment biases and errors, or on testing simple heuristic models suitable only for highly specific cases; they have not attempted to give general-purpose unifying models.  In computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics researchers have long sought to formalize common-sense physical reasoning but without success in approaching human-level competence.  Here we show that a wide range of human physical judgments can be explained by positing an “intuitive me</p><p>3 0.74109423 <a title="1652-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-17-Where_do_theories_come_from%3F.html">1861 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-17-Where do theories come from?</a></p>

A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

<p>Introduction: Hey,  this  looks cool: 
  
Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers   


Virgil Gligor Carnegie Mellon University 


We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scams/deception. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced</p><p>5 0.68985254 <a title="1652-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-25-Classical_probability_does_not_apply_to_quantum_systems_%28causal_inference_edition%29.html">2037 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-25-Classical probability does not apply to quantum systems (causal inference edition)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: James Robins, Tyler VanderWeele, and Richard Gill  write :
  
Neyman introduced a formal mathematical theory of counterfactual causation that now has become standard language in many quantitative disciplines, but not in physics. We use results on causal interaction and interference between treatments (derived under the Neyman theory) to give a simple new proof of a well-known result in quantum physics, namely, Bellís inequality.


Now the predictions of quantum mechanics and the results of experiment both violate Bell’s inequality. In the remainder of the talk, we review the implications for a counterfactual theory of causation. Assuming with Einstein that faster than light (supraluminal) communication is not possible, one can view the Neyman theory of counterfactuals as falsified by experiment. . . .


Is it safe for a quantitative discipline to rely on a counterfactual approach to causation, when our best confirmed physical theory falsifies their existence?

<p>Introduction: Professor of business management Edwin Locke sent me  an article :
  
This paper argues that theory building in the social sciences, management and psychology included, should be inductive. It begins by critiquing contemporary philosophy of science, e.g., Popper’s falsifiability theory, his stress on deduction, and the hypothetico-deductive method. Next I present some history of the concept of induction in philosophy and of inductive theory building in the hard sciences (e.g., Aristotle, Bacon, Newton). This is followed by three examples of successful theory building by induction in psychology and management (Beck’s theory, Bandura’s social-cognitive theory, goal setting theory). The paper concludes with some suggested guidelines for successful theory building through induction and some new policies that journal editors might encourage.
  
Like most social scientists (but maybe not most  Bayesians ), I’m pretty much a  Popperian  myself, so I was interested to see someone taking such a</p><p>2 0.95286071 <a title="1652-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-18-The_treatment%2C_the_intermediate_outcome%2C_and_the_ultimate_outcome%3A__Leverage_and_the_financial_crisis.html">1420 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-18-The treatment, the intermediate outcome, and the ultimate outcome:  Leverage and the financial crisis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Huberman points to an article on the financial crisis by Bethany McLean, who  writes :
  
lthough our understanding of what instigated the 2008 global financial crisis remains at best incomplete, there are a few widely agreed upon contributing factors. One of them is a 2004 rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allowed investment banks to load up on leverage.


This disastrous decision has been cited by a host of prominent economists, including Princeton professor and former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Alan Blinder and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. It has even been immortalized in Hollywood, figuring into the dark financial narrative that propelled the Academy Award-winning film Inside Job. . . .


Here’s just one problem with this story line: It’s not true. Nor is it hard to prove that. Look at the historical leverage of the big five investment banks — Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.  So we</p><p>4 0.92643797 <a title="1652-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-30-A_Wikipedia_riddle%21.html">831 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-30-A Wikipedia riddle!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was distinguished for over three years and now am renowned.  For most of the past year and a half, though, I was neither.
 
Who am I?
 
First person who guesses the right answer in comments gets a free copy of Jenny Davidson’s book, “Breeding”–as soon as she sends it to me, as she promised a couple years ago!
 
You’ll get an extra prize if you can express the answer in an indirect way, without using the person’s name or being too obvious about it but making the identification clear enough that I know you know the answer.

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>6 0.9232285 <a title="1652-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-17-I_got_99_comparisons_but_multiplicity_ain%E2%80%99t_one.html">1016 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-17-I got 99 comparisons but multiplicity ain’t one</a></p>

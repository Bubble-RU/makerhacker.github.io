<p>Introduction: I’m not sure how the New York Times defines a blog versus an article, so perhaps this post should be called “Bayes in the blogs.”  Whatever.  A  recent NY Times article/blog post  discusses a classic Bayes’ Theorem application — probability that the patient has cancer, given a “positive” mammogram — and purports to give a solution that is easy for students to understand because it doesn’t require Bayes’ Theorem, which is of course complicated and confusing.  You can see  my comment (#17) here.</p><p>3 0.063459419 <a title="1724-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-07-The_more_likely_it_is_to_be_X%2C_the_more_likely_it_is_to_be_Not_X%3F.html">1158 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-07-The more likely it is to be X, the more likely it is to be Not X?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
A  paper by Wood, Douglas, and Sutton  looks at “Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories.”  Unfortunately the  subjects were 140 undergraduate psychology students, so one wonders how general the results are.  I found this sort of arresting:
  
In Study 1 (n=137), the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed she was murdered.  In Study 2 (n=102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. Special Forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive.
  
As the article says, “conspiracy advocates’ distrust of official narratives may be so strong that many alternative theories are simultaneously endorsed in spite of any contradictions between them.”  But I think the authors overstate things when they say “One would think that there ought to be a negative correlation between beliefs in contradictory accounts of events — the more one believes in</p><p>4 0.062722437 <a title="1724-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-08-For_chrissake%2C_just_make_up_an_analysis_already%21__We_have_a_lab_here_to_run%2C_y%E2%80%99know%3F.html">1973 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-08-For chrissake, just make up an analysis already!

Stuck in the middle of the supplemental data, reporting the total workup for their compounds, was this gem:

 
Emma, please insert NMR data here! where are they? and for this compound, just make up an elemental analysis . . .
 
  
I’m reminded of our recent  discussions  of coauthorship, where I argued that I see real advantages to having multiple people taking responsibility for the result.  Jay Verkuilen responded: “On the flipside of collaboration . . . is diffusion of responsibility, where everybody thinks someone else ‘has that problem’ and thus things don’t get solved.”  That’s what seems to have happened (hilariously) here.</p><p>5 0.06257049 <a title="1724-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-24-Flawed_visualization_of_U.S._voting_maybe_has_some_good_features.html">428 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-24-Flawed visualization of U.S. voting maybe has some good features</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this attractive visualization  by David Sparks of U.S. voting.
 
On the plus side, the pictures and associated movie (showing an oddly horizontally-stretched-out United States) are pretty and seem to have gotten a bit of attention–the maps have received 31 comments, which is more than we get on almost all our blog entries here.
 
On the minus side, the movie is misleading.  In many years it shows the whole U.S. as a single color, even when candidates from both parties won some votes.  The text has errors too, for example the false claim that the South favored a Democratic candidate in 1980.  The southern states that Jimmy Carter carried in 1980 were Georgia and . . . that’s it.
 
But, as Aleks says, once this tool is out there, maybe people can use it to do better.  It’s in that spirit that I’m linking.  Ya gotta start somewhere.
 
Also, this is a good example of a general principle:  When you make a graph, look at it carefully to see if it makes sense!</p><p>6 0.061828401 <a title="1724-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-06-New_words_of_1917.html">1970 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-06-New words of 1917</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>3 0.72329372 <a title="1724-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-27-%E2%80%9CApple_confronts_the_law_of_large_numbers%E2%80%9D_._._._huh%3F.html">1187 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-27-“Apple confronts the law of large numbers” . . . huh?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was reading this  news article  by famed business reporter James Stewart: 
  
  
Measured by market capitalization, Apple is the world’s biggest public company. . . . Sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 . . . totaled $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from the year before. Earnings more than doubled. . . . Here is the rub: Apple is so big, it’s running up against the law of large numbers.
  
Huh?  At this point I sat up, curious.  Stewart continued:
  
Also known as the golden theorem, with a proof attributed to the 17th-century Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the law states that a variable will revert to a mean over a large sample of results. In the case of the largest companies, it suggests that high earnings growth and a rapid rise in share price will slow as those companies grow ever larger.


If Apple’s share price grew even 20 percent a year for the next decade, which is far below its current blistering pace, its $500 billion market capitalization would be more than $3 tri</p><p>4 0.71949685 <a title="1724-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-14-Higgs_bozos%3A__Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_are_spinning_in_their_graves.html">1058 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-14-Higgs bozos:  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are spinning in their graves</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg sends in this  bizarre bit  of news reporting by Robert Evans:
  
Until now, in the four decades since it was first posited, no one has convincingly claimed to have glimpsed the Higgs Boson, let alone proved that it actually exists.


At an eagerly awaited briefing on Tuesday at the CERN research centre near Geneva, two independent teams of “Higgs Hunters” – a term they themselves hate – were widely expected to suggest they were fairly confident they had spotted it.


But not confident enough, in the physics world of ultra-precision where certainty has to be measured at nothing less than 100 percent, to announce “a discovery.”


In the jargon, this level is described as 5 sigma . . .
  
So far, so good.  But then comes this doozy:

<p>Introduction: It was reported  last year  that the national lottery of Israel featured the exact same 6 numbers (out of 45) twice in the same month, and statistics professor Isaac Meilijson of Tel Aviv University was quoted as saying that “the incident of six numbers repeating themselves within a month is an event of once in 10,000 years.”
 
I shouldn’t mock when it comes to mathematics–after all, I proved a false theorem once!  (Or, to be precise, my collaborator and I published a false claim which we thought we’d proved, thus we thought was a theorem.)
 
So let me retract the mockery and move, first to the mathematics and then to the statistics.
  

 
First, how many possibilities are there in pick 6 out of 45?  It’s (45*44*43*42*41*40)/6! = 8,145,060.  Let’s call this number N.
 
Second, what’s the probability that the same numbers repeat in a single calendar month?  I’ve been told that the Israeli lottery has 2 draws per week,  That’s 104/12=8.67 draws per month.  Or maybe they skip some holiday</p><p>6 0.71701223 <a title="1724-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-01-An_%28almost%29_testable_assumption_on_dogmatism%2C_and_my_guess_of_the_answer%2C_based_on_psychometric_principles.html">121 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-01-An (almost) testable assumption on dogmatism, and my guess of the answer, based on psychometric principles</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

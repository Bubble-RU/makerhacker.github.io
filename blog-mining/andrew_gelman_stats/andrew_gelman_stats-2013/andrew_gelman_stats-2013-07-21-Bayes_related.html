This sounds like something I agree with, and one of the things I tried to do in the book is to put modeling decisions front and center.  But the word “modeling” is used in lots of ways, so I want to see if we are talking about the same thing.


For example, in many chapters, I start with a simple model of the scenario, do some analysis, then check whether the model is good enough, and iterate.

<p>Introduction: Statistical Methods and Data Skepticism 
  
Data analysis today is dominated by three paradigms:  null hypothesis significance testing, Bayesian inference, and exploratory data analysis.  There is concern that all these methods lead to overconfidence on the part of researchers and the general public, and this concern has led to the new “data skepticism” movement.


But the history of statistics is already in some sense a history of data skepticism.  Concepts of bias, variance, sampling and measurement error, least-squares regression, and statistical significance can all be viewed as formalizations of data skepticism.  All these methods address the concern that patterns in observed data might not generalize to the population of interest.


We discuss the challenge of attaining data skepticism while avoiding data nihilism, and consider some proposed future directions.

I am new to Bayesian methods.  While I am reading your book, I have some questions for you.  I am interested in doing Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression (e.g., random-intercept model) and Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM)—for causality.  Do you happen to know if I could find some articles, where authors could provide data w/ R and/or BUGS codes that I could replicate them?
  
My reply:  For Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression and causal inference, see my book with Jennifer Hill.  For Bayesian structural equation modeling, try google and you’ll find some good stuff.  Also, I recommend Stan (http://mc-stan.org/) rather than Bugs.</p><p>3 0.80094671 <a title="1948-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-23-Bayesian_adaptive_methods_for_clinical_trials.html">427 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-23-Bayesian adaptive methods for clinical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scott Berry, Brad Carlin, Jack Lee, and Peter Muller recently came out with  a book  with the above title.
 
The book packs a lot into its 280 pages and is fun to read as well (even if they do use the word “modalities” in their first paragraph, and later on they use the phrase “DIC criterion,” which upsets my tidy, logical mind).  The book starts off fast on page 1 and never lets go.
 
Clinical trials are a big part of statistics and it’s cool to see the topic taken seriously and being treated rigorously.  (Here I’m not talking about empty mathematical rigor (or, should I say, “rigor”), so-called optimal designs and all that, but rather the rigor of applied statistics, mapping models to reality.)
 
Also I have a few technical suggestions.
 
1.  The authors fit a lot of models in Bugs, which is fine, but they go overboard on the WinBUGS thing.  There’s WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS:  they’re all Bugs recommend running Bugs from R using the clunky BRugs interface rather than the smoother bugs(</p><p>4 0.79660153 <a title="1948-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-31-He%E2%80%99s_getting_ready_to_write_a_book.html">1783 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-31-He’s getting ready to write a book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Novik does some open-source  planning :
  
My co-author, Jacki Buros, and I [Novik] have just signed a contract with Apress to write a book tentatively entitled “Predictive Analytics with R”, which will cover programming best practices, data munging, data exploration, and single and multi-level models with case studies in social media, healthcare, politics, marketing, and the stock market.


Why does the world need another R book?  We think there is a shortage of books that deal with the complete and programmer centric analysis of real, dirty, and sometimes unstructured data.  Our target audience are people who have some familiarity with statistics, but do not have much experience with programming. . . .


The book is projected to be about 300 pages across 8 chapters. This is my first experience with writing a book and everything I heard about the process tells me that this is going to be a long and arduous endeavor lasting anywhere from 6 to 8 months.

I [Bell] just finished “The Emperor of All Maladies” from 2010. One of the sections is captioned with the “In God we trust, all others bring data” quote which is supposedly from Deming. If you haven’t read it, I think you might like it even though the topic is pretty morbid (i.e. cancer).


I was rereading chapter 7 in Bayesian Data Analysis. While the principles there would allow me to “roll my own”, I was wondering whether or not there is now a comprehensive “cookbook” out there that gathers together such analyses for a variety of experimental designs – sort of a Bayesian equivalent to Montgomery’s “Design and Analysis of Experiments”.

I don’t know, but now I’m thinking we should put some of this in our forthcoming book, Statistics for Psychology Research.

<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

I am experimenting with the mapping/visualization of survey response data, with a particular focus on using transparency to convey uncertainty. See some examples  here .


Do you think the examples are successful at communicating both local values of the variable of interest, as well as the lack of information in certain places? Also, do you have any general advice for choosing an approach to spatially smoothing the data in a way that preserves local features, but prevents individual respondents from standing out? I have experimented a lot with smoothing in these maps, and the cost of preventing the Midwest and West from looking “spotty” is the oversmoothing of the Northeast.
  
My quick impression is that the graphs are more pretty than they are informative.  But “pretty” is not such a bad thing!  The conveying-information part is more difficult:  to me, the graphs seem to be displaying a somewhat confusing mix of opinion level and population density.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>5 0.97459513 <a title="1948-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-04-Cool_one-day_miniconference_at_Columbia_Fri_12_Oct_on_computational_and_online_social_science.html">1481 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-04-Cool one-day miniconference at Columbia Fri 12 Oct on computational and online social science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing we do here at the Applied Statistics Center is hold mini-conferences.  The next one looks really cool.  It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods. Together these advances have created an unprecedented opportunity to address longstanding questions in the social sciences, rang</p><p>6 0.97410983 <a title="1948-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-29-Roth_and_Amsterdam.html">57 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-29-Roth and Amsterdam</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog know about  the Bechdel test  for movies:
 
1. It has to have at least two women in it 
2. Who talk to each other 
3. About something besides a man
 
Amusing, huh?  But I only really got the point the other day, when I was on a plane and passively watched parts of the in-flight movie.  It was something I’d never heard of (of course) and it happened to be a chick flick–even without the soundtrack, it was clear that the main character was a woman and much of it was about her love life.  But even this movie failed the Bechdel test miserably!  I don’t even think it passed item #1 above, but if it did, it certainly failed #2.
 
If even the chick flicks are failing the Bechdel test, then, yeah, we’re really in trouble.  And don’t get me started on those old Warner Brothers cartoons.  They’re great but they feature about as many female characters as the average WWII submarine.  Sure, everybody knows this, but it’s still striking to think about just how unbalanced</p><p>5 0.095596835 <a title="2103-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-17-%E2%80%9CFaith_means_belief_in_something_concerning_which_doubt_is_theoretically_possible.%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%94_William_James.html">1419 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-17-“Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.” — William James</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone writes:
  
Probably not blog-worthy/blog-appropriate, but have you heard Bill James  discussing  the Sandusky & Paterno stuff?  I think you discussed once his stance on the Dowd Report, and this seems to be from the same part of his personality—which goes beyond contrarian . . .
  
I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: Val has reported success with the following trick:
  
Get to the classroom a few minutes earlier and turn on soft music.  Then set everything up and, the moment it’s time for class to begin, put a clicker question on the screen and turn off the music.  The students quiet down and get to work right away.
  
I’ve never liked the usual struggle with students to get them to settle down in class, as it seemed to set up a dynamic in which I was trying to get the students to focus and they were trying to goof off.  Turning off the music seems like a great non-confrontational way to send the signal that class is starting.</p><p>4 0.69915313 <a title="2103-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-Fitting_discrete-data_regression_models_in_social_science.html">325 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-Fitting discrete-data regression models in social science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In response to some big new push for testing schoolchildren, Mark Palko  writes :
  
The announcement of a new curriculum is invariably followed by a round of hearty round of self congratulations and talk of “keeping standards high” as if adding a slide to a PowerPoint automatically made students better informed. It doesn’t work that way. Adding a topic to the list simply means that students will be exposed to it, not that they will understand or master or retain it.
  
Well put.  In my own teaching, I often am tempted to believe that just putting a topic in a homework problem is enough to ensure that students will learn it.  But it doesn’t work that way.  Even if they manage to somehow struggle through and solve the problem (and many don’t, or they rely on their friends’ solutions), they won’t learn much if they don’t see the connection with everything else they know.

<p>Introduction: Objects of the class “Foghorn Leghorn” :   parodies that are more famous than the original.  (“It would be as if everybody were familiar with Duchamp’s Mona-Lisa-with-a-moustache while never having heard of Leonardo’s version.”)
 
 Objects of the class “Whoopi Goldberg” :  actors who are undeniably talented but are almost always in bad movies, or at least movies that aren’t worthy of their talent.  (The opposite:  William Holden.)
 
 Objects of the class “Weekend at Bernie’s” :  low-quality movie, nobody’s actually seen it, but everybody knows what it’s about.  (Other examples:  Heathers and Zelig.)

<p>Introduction: After our  discussion  of the sad case of Darrell Huff, the celebrated “How to Lie with Statistics” guy who had a lucrative side career disparaging the link between smoking and cancer, I was motivated to follow John Mashey’s  recommendation  and read the book, Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition, by historian Robert Proctor.
 
My first stop upon receiving the book was the index, in particular the entry for  Rubin, Donald B.   I followed the reference to pages 440-442 and found the description of Don’s activities to be accurate, neither diminished nor overstated, to the best of my knowledge.
 
Rubin is the second-most-famous statistician to have been paid by the cigarette industry, but several other big and small names have been on the payroll at one time or another.  Here’s a partial  list .  Just including the people I know or have heard of:
 
Herbert Solomon, Stanford

<p>Introduction: When predicting 0/1 data we can use logit (or probit or robit or some other robust model such as invlogit (0.01 + 0.98*X*beta)).  Logit is simple enough and we can use  bayesglm  to regularize and avoid the problem of separation.
 
What if there are more than 2 categories?  If they’re ordered (1, 2, 3, etc), we can do ordered logit (and use bayespolr() to avoid separation).  If the categories are unordered (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), there are unordered multinomial logit and probit models out there.
 
But it’s not so easy to fit these multinomial model in a multilevel setting (with coefficients that vary by group), especially if the computation is embedded in an iterative routine such as mi where you have real time constraints at each step.
 
So this got me wondering whether we could kluge it with logits.  Here’s the basic idea (in the ordered and unordered forms):
 
- If you have a variable that goes 1, 2, 3, etc., set up a series of logits:  1 vs. 2,3,…; 2 vs. 3,…; and so forth</p><p>4 0.95896566 <a title="2103-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles_of_criminal_justice.html">1621 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles of criminal justice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

<p>Introduction: I have a great idea for a movie.  Actually two movies based on two variants of a similar idea.
 
It all started when I saw this story:
  
Dr. Anil Potti, the controversial cancer researcher whose work at Duke University led to lawsuits from patients, is now a medical oncologist at the Cancer Center of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
  
When asked about Dr. Potti’s controversial appointment, his new boss  said :
  
If a guy can’t get a second chance here in North Dakota, where he trained, man, you can’t get a second chance anywhere.
  
(Link from  Retraction Watch , of course.)
 
Potti’s boss is also quoted as saying, “Most, if not all, his patients have loved him.”  On the other hand, the news article reports: “The North Carolina medical board’s website lists settlements against Potti of at least $75,000.”  I guess there’s no reason you can’t love a guy and still want a juicy malpractice settlement.
 
 Second Chance U

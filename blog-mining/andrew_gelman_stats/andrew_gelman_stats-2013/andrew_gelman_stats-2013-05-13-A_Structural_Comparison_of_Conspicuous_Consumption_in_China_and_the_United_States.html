<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat points to  this interview , which, he writes, covers themes that are discussed on the blog such as wrong ideas that don’t die, peer review and the statistics of conflict deaths.
 
I agree.  It’s good stuff.  Here are some of the things that Spagat says (he’s being interviewed by Joel Wing):
  
In fact, the standard excess-deaths concept leads to an interesting conundrum when combined with an interesting fact exposed in the next-to-latest  Human Security Report ; in most countries child mortality rates decline during armed conflict (chapter 6). So if you believe the usual excess-death causality story then you’re forced to conclude that many conflicts actually save the lives of many children. Of course, the idea of wars savings lives is pretty hard to swallow.

<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>4 0.12073383 <a title="1854-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-17-Macro_causality.html">807 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-17-Macro causality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Backus writes:
  
 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics.  The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money.  But how do we know it’s not the reverse:  that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well.  As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true.  What I’d call the demand-side story (more spending leads to more output) is everywhere, including this piece, from the usually reliable David Leonhardt.
  
This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?

Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

I am a sociologist/criminologist working at Statistics Norway. As I am not a trained statistician, I find myself sometimes in need to check basic statistical concepts. Recently, I came across an article which I found a bit strange, but I needed to check up on my statistical understanding of a very basic concept: the r-squared. When doing so, I realized that this was also an interesting case of research ethics. Given your interest in research ethics, I though this might be interesting to you.


 Here’s  the mentioned article, by Weisburd and Piquero, is attached. What they do is to analyzed reported results from all articles published in the highest ranking criminological journal since 1968 through 2005 to determine whether there are any progress in the field of criminology. Their approach is basically to calculate the average r-square from linear models in published articles. For example, they state that “variance explained provides one way to assess</p><p>4 0.71844614 <a title="1854-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-Advocacy_in_the_form_of_a_%E2%80%9Cdeliberative_forum%E2%80%9D.html">113 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-Advocacy in the form of a “deliberative forum”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Sides   reports on  a paper by Benjamin Page and Lawrence Jacobs about so-called deliberative forums, in particular a set of meetings called America Speaks that have been organized and conducted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an  organization  formed by the former advertising executive, Secretary of Commerce, and investment banker to focus attention on the national debt.
 
Sides, Page, and Jacobs discuss three key points:
  

 
1. Any poll or focus group is only as good as its sample, and there is no evidence that the participants in the America Speaks forums were selected in a way to be representative of the nation.  Page and Jacobs write:
  
Deliberative forums often fail to get a representative sample of Americans to participate, even when they try hard to do so. Worse, some deliberative forums make little or no serious effort to achieve representativeness. They throw open the doors to self-selected political activists with extreme opinions, or they compile a secret list</p><p>5 0.70944476 <a title="1854-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-27-Richard_Stallman_and_John_McCarthy.html">1031 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-27-Richard Stallman and John McCarthy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After blogging on quirky software pioneer  Richard Stallman , I thought it appropriate to write something about recently deceased quirky software pioneer John McCarthy, who, with the exception of being bearded, seems like he was the personal and political opposite of Stallman.
 
 Here’s  a page I found of  Stallman  McCarthy quotes (compiled by Neil Craig).  It’s a mixture of the reasonable and the unreasonable (ok, I suppose the same could be said of this blog!).
 
I wonder if he and Stallman ever met and, if so, whether they had an extended conversation.  It would be like matter and anti-matter! 
   
P.S.  I flipped through McCarthy’s pages and found one of my pet peeves.  See item 3  here , which sounds so plausible but is in fact  not true  (at least, not according to the National Election Study).  As McCarthy’s Stanford colleague Mo Fiorina can tell you, otherwise well-informed people believe all sorts of things about polarization that aren’t so.

<p>Introduction: . . . and I decided to amuse myself by writing down all the management-speak words I heard:
 
“grappling” 
“early prototypes” 
“technology platform” 
“building block” 
“machine learning” 
“your team” 
“workspace” 
“tagging” 
“data exhaust” 
“monitoring a particular population” 
“collective intelligence” 
“communities of practice” 
“hackathon” 
“human resources . . . technologies”
 
Any one or two or three of these phrases might be fine, but put them all together and what you have is a festival of jargon.

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>3 0.96946472 <a title="1854-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-27-Richard_Stallman_and_John_McCarthy.html">1031 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-27-Richard Stallman and John McCarthy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After blogging on quirky software pioneer  Richard Stallman , I thought it appropriate to write something about recently deceased quirky software pioneer John McCarthy, who, with the exception of being bearded, seems like he was the personal and political opposite of Stallman.
 
 Here’s  a page I found of  Stallman  McCarthy quotes (compiled by Neil Craig).  It’s a mixture of the reasonable and the unreasonable (ok, I suppose the same could be said of this blog!).
 
I wonder if he and Stallman ever met and, if so, whether they had an extended conversation.  It would be like matter and anti-matter! 
   
P.S.  I flipped through McCarthy’s pages and found one of my pet peeves.  See item 3  here , which sounds so plausible but is in fact  not true  (at least, not according to the National Election Study).  As McCarthy’s Stanford colleague Mo Fiorina can tell you, otherwise well-informed people believe all sorts of things about polarization that aren’t so.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>5 0.9671064 <a title="1854-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-04-A_Wikipedia_whitewash.html">69 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-04-A Wikipedia whitewash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After hearing a few times about the divorce predictions of researchers John Gottman and James Murray (work that was featured in Blink with a claim that they could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced–after meeting with them for 15 minutes) and  feeling some skepticism , I decided to do the Lord’s work and amend Gottman’s wikipedia entry, which had a paragraph saying:
  
Gottman found his methodology predicts with 90% accuracy which newlywed couples will remain married and which will divorce four to six years later. It is also 81% percent accurate in predicting which marriages will survive after seven to nine years.
  
I added the following:
  
Gottman’s claim of 81% or 90% accuracy is misleading, however, because the accuracy is measured only  after  fitting a model to his data. There is no evidence that he can predict the outcome of a marriage with high accuracy in advance.

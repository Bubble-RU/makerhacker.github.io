<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  writes :
  
I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed. It is not obvious to me [Sethi]</p><p>3 0.16950262 <a title="1832-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-30-Blogging.html">2002 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-30-Blogging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A journalist asked me for my thoughts on academics and blogging, in light of the  recently announced  move of the sister blog to the Washington Post.  I responded as follows: 
  
  
John Sides is the leader of the Monkey Cage and in particular was the key person involved in the Washington Post move.


But I will give you some general comments based on my own experiences.


I started blogging in 2004:  Samantha Cook (my postdoc at the time) and I set up the blog so that we could communicate our partially-formed research ideas to each other, in a way that would be open to the world so that (a) we could get input from interested outsiders, and (b) we could publicize our work.  We decided to post daily (or approximately thus).  At the time, I figured that if there was ever a time that we ran out of material, I could post summaries of my old research papers.


The blog quickly became a place for us to give our various thoughts on statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science.</p><p>4 0.16439191 <a title="1832-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m postponing today’s scheduled post (“Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models”) to continue the lively discussion from yesterday,  What if I were to stop publishing in journals? . 
   
 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.  The second paper, in particular, took some effort to place; I got some advice from colleagues in sociology as to where</p><p>5 0.14753979 <a title="1832-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-17-Wanted%3A__365_stories_of_statistics.html">1678 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-17-Wanted:  365 stories of statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The American Statistical Association has a blog called the Statistics Forum that I edit but haven’t been doing much with.  Originally I thought we’d get a bunch of bloggers and have a topic each week or each month and get discussions from lots of perspectives.  But it was hard to get people to keep contributing, and the blog+comments approach didn’t seem to be working as a way to get wide-ranging discussion.  I did organize a good  roundtable discussion  at one point, but it took a lot of work on my part.
 
Recently I had another idea for the blog, based on something that Kaiser Fung wrote on  three hours in the life of a statistician , along with a similar (if a bit more impressionistic)  piece  I wrote awhile back describing my experiences on a typical workday.
 
So here’s the plan.  365 of you write vignettes about your statistical lives.  Get into the nitty gritty—tell me what you do, and why you’re doing it.  I’ll collect these and then post them at the Statistics Forum, one a day</p><p>6 0.14389369 <a title="1832-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-02-Fragment_of_statistical_autobiography.html">390 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-02-Fragment of statistical autobiography</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was at a work-related event today [actually, last month; these non-topical blog entries are on approximately one-month delay], but not connected to the statistics or political science departments.  There were a few people there I knew well, and they were introducing me to others.  Then at some point when I was talking with one of the more important people in the room, a sixtyish guy comes by and stands next to us.  I put out my hand and introduce myself.  He looks at me in puzzlement, spits out his first name, and without a pause starts talking to the person I’d been speaking with.  After about a minute of talk, he walks away, and the important person and I continued our conversation.
 
No big deal . . . but, I have to admit, I haven’t had that experience very often recently.  I’m often at events where I know everyone (or almost everyone) and they know me, and I’m also often at events where I know very few people and have to introduce myself.  But it’s rare to be somewhere where I’m</p><p>3 0.82958007 <a title="1832-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written_slam_on_moderately_celebrated_writers_is_amusing_nonetheless.html">204 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written slam on moderately celebrated writers is amusing nonetheless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

<p>Introduction: Journalist Jonathan Rauch  writes  that the internet is Sturgeon squared:
  
This is the blogosphere. I’m not getting paid to be here. I’m here to get incredibly famous (in my case, even more incredibly famous) so that I can get paid somewhere else. . . .


The average quality of newspapers and (published) novels is far, far better than the average quality of blog posts (and–ugh!–comments). This is because people pay for newspapers and novels. What distinguishes newspapers and novels is how much does not get published in them, because people won’t pay for it. Payment is a filter, and a pretty good one. Imperfect, of course. But pointing out the defects of the old model is merely changing the subject if the new model is worse. . . .


Yes, the new model is bringing a lot of new content into being. But most of it is bad. And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. Even in the information economy, there’s no free lunch. . . .

I recently came across  an interesting blog post , written by someone who is self-taught in statistics (not that there’s anything wrong with that).


I have no particular expertise in statistics, but her analysis looks impressive to me.  I’d be very interested to find out the opinion of a professional statistician.  Do you have any interest in blogging about this subject?
  
My (disappointing, I’m sure) reply:  This indeed looks interesting.  I don’t have the time/energy to look at it more right now, and it’s too far from any areas of my expertise for me to give any kind of quick informed opinion.  It would be good for this sort of discussion to appear in a nutrition journal where the real experts could get at it.  I expect there are some strong statisticians who work in that field, although I don’t really know for sure.
 
P.S.  I suppose I really should try to learn more about this sort of thing, as it could well affect my life more than a lot of other subje</p><p>6 0.81076038 <a title="1832-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-24-Blogging.html">49 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-24-Blogging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>2 0.97134483 <a title="1832-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-26-Suggested_resolution_of_the_Bem_paradox.html">1139 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-26-Suggested resolution of the Bem paradox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96528643 <a title="1832-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-The_blogroll.html">1832 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-The blogroll</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I encourage you to check out our  linked blogs .  Here’s what they’re all about:
 
 Cognitive and Behavioral Science 
 
 BPS Research Digest :  I haven’t been following this one recently, but it has lots of good links, I should probably check it more often.  There are a couple things that bother me, though.  The blog is sponsored by the British Psychological Society, so this sounds pretty serious.  But then they run things like advertising  promotions  sponsored by a textbook company and highlight iffy experimental claims.  For example, in 2010 they ran a wholly uncritical  post  on the notorious Daryl Bem study that purported to find ESP.  After being called on it in the comments, the blogger (Christian Jarrett) responded with, “The stats appear sound. . . . it’s a great study. Rigorously conducted” and even defended “the discussion of quantum physics in the paper.”  To be fair, though, and as he  points out  in comments, Jarrett wrote of Bem’s study:  “this isn’t proof of psi, far fr</p><p>4 0.96241826 <a title="1832-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-12-Steven_Pinker%E2%80%99s_unconvincing_debunking_of_group_selection.html">1414 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-12-Steven Pinker’s unconvincing debunking of group selection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>5 0.96238792 <a title="1832-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-31-How_to_fix_the_tabloids%3F__Toward_replicable_social_science_research.html">1878 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-31-How to fix the tabloids?

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>6 0.9623121 <a title="1832-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-20-Do_differences_between_biology_and_statistics_explain_some_of_our_diverging_attitudes_regarding_criticism_and_replication_of_scientific_claims%3F.html">2218 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-20-Do differences between biology and statistics explain some of our diverging attitudes regarding criticism and replication of scientific claims?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . .

<p>Introduction: What follows is a long response to a comment on  someone else’s blog .  The quote is, “Thinking like an economist simply means that you scientifically approach human social behavior. . . .”
 
I’ll give the context in a bit, but first let me say that I thought this topic might be worth one more discussion because I suspect that the sort of economics exceptionalism that I will discuss is widely disseminated in college econ courses as well as in books such as the Freakonomics series.
 
It’s great to have pride in human achievements but at some point too much group self-regard can be distorting.
 
My best analogy to economics exceptionalism is Freudianism in the 1950s:  Back then, Freudian psychiatrists were on the top of the world.  Not only were they well paid, well respected, and secure in their theoretical foundations, they were also at the center of many important conversations.  Even those people who disagreed with them felt the need to explain why the Freudians were wrong.

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points us to a recent  news article  by Jennifer Couzin-Frankel, who writes about the selection bias arising from the routine use of outcome criteria to exclude animals in medical trials.  In statistics and econometrics, this is drilled into us:  Selection on x is OK, selection on y is not OK.  But apparently in biomedical research this principle is not so well known (or, perhaps, it is all too well known).
 
Couzin-Frankel starts with an example of a drug trial in which 3 of the 10 mice in the treatment group were removed from the analysis because they had died from massive strokes.  This sounds pretty bad, but it’s even worse than that:  this was from a paper under review that “described how a new drug protected a rodent’s brain after a stroke.”  Death isn’t a very good way to protect a rodent’s brain!
 
The news article continues:

My graphs– what do you think??

 

I guess what do you think of the result too, but the answer is, “That’s obvious!”  If it hadn’t been, then it would have been suspicious in my book. Of course, if we had found the opposite result, that would have been “obvious!” too.  We are submitting to   LR ≠1 Journa l 

 This is the latest study in series looking at relationship between critical reasoning capacities and “cultural cognition” — the tendency of individuals to conform their perceptions of risk & other policy-relevant facts to their group commitments. The first installment was an  observational study  that found that cultural polarization ( political too ; the distinction relate not to the mechanism for polarization over decision-relevant science but only about  how to measure  what is hypothesized to be driving it) increases as people become more science literate.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko asks what I think of  this  news article by John Tierney.  The article’s webpage is given the strange incomplete title above.
 
My first comment is that the headline appears false.  I didn’t see any evidence presented of liberal bias. (If the headline says “Social psychologists detect,” I expect to see some detection, not just anecdotes.) What I did see was a discussion of the fact that most academic psychologists consider themselves politically liberal (a pattern that holds for academic researchers in general), along with some anecdotes of moderates over the years who have felt their political views disrespected by the liberal majority.
  

 
I’m interested in the topic, and I’m open to the possibility that there are all sorts of biases in academic research–but I don’t see the evidence from this article that social psychologists have detected any bias yet.  Phrases such as “a statistically impossible lack of diversity” are just silly.

<p>Introduction: Q. D. Leavis wrote:
  
The answer does seem to be that the academic world, like other worlds, is run by the politicians, and sensitively scrupulous people tend to leave politics to other people, while people with genuine work to do certainly have no time as well as no taste for committee-rigging and the associated techniques.  And then of course there are the forces of native stupidity reinforced by that blind hostility to criticism, reform, new ideas and superior ability which is human as well as academic nature.
  
Not that I’ve ever read anything by Mrs. Leavis (or, as the Brits used to write, Mrs Leavis).  The above quote is one of the epigraphs to a book by Richard Kostelanetz.  Whom I’ve never heard of, except in a footnote in John Rodden’s classic Orwell study, The Politics of Literary Reputation.
 
I’ll have more to say about Orwell in another post, but for now let me return to the above Leavis quote, to which I have three reactions:

<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>2 0.94701624 <a title="1947-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>3 0.94556433 <a title="1947-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-22-Picking_pennies_in_front_of_a_steamroller%3A__A_parable_comes_to_life.html">2259 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-22-Picking pennies in front of a steamroller:  A parable comes to life</a></p>

 Chapter 1 


On Sunday we were over on 125 St so I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Jesus Taco was next door so I went there instead.  What a mistake!  I don’t know what Masanao and Yu-Sung could’ve been thinking.  Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn’t impress me).  I’m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I’m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn’t tell anyone.  I can’t really figure out why I’m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.  It’s a good deal:  they’re small but not that small.  Sure, I ate 6 of them, but I was h</p><p>4 0.93111897 <a title="1947-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-Defining_ourselves_arbitrarily.html">1411 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-Defining ourselves arbitrarily</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.
 
Robin Hanson happens not to use much slang and he uses this trait to define himself, not quite to stand out in the crowd but to put himself on one end of a scale.

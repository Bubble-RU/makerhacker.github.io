<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>3 0.13637711 <a title="2020-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning_to_Stan.html">2291 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning to Stan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual

<p>Introduction: Statistical Methods and Data Skepticism 
  
Data analysis today is dominated by three paradigms:  null hypothesis significance testing, Bayesian inference, and exploratory data analysis.  There is concern that all these methods lead to overconfidence on the part of researchers and the general public, and this concern has led to the new “data skepticism” movement.


But the history of statistics is already in some sense a history of data skepticism.  Concepts of bias, variance, sampling and measurement error, least-squares regression, and statistical significance can all be viewed as formalizations of data skepticism.  All these methods address the concern that patterns in observed data might not generalize to the population of interest.


We discuss the challenge of attaining data skepticism while avoiding data nihilism, and consider some proposed future directions.

<p>Introduction: We interrupt our usual program of  Ed Wegman   Gregg Easterbrook  Niall Ferguson mockery to deliver a serious update on our statistical computing project.
 
 Stan  (“Sampling Through Adaptive Neighborhoods”) is our new C++ program (written mostly by Bob Carpenter) that draws samples from Bayesian models.  Stan can take different sorts of inputs:  you can write the model in a Bugs-like syntax and it goes from there, or you can write the log-posterior directly as a C++ function.
 
Most of the computation is done using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC requires some tuning, so Matt Hoffman up and wrote a new algorithm, Nuts (the “No-U-Turn Sampler”) which optimizes HMC adaptively.  In many settings, Nuts is actually more computationally efficient than the optimal static HMC!
 
 When the  the Nuts paper  appeared on Arxiv, Christian Robert noticed it and had  some reactions .
 
In response to Xian’s comments, Matt writes:

<p>Introduction: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as used by  Stan , is only defined for continuous parameters.  We’d love to be able to do discrete sampling.  So I was excited when I saw this:
  

Yichuan Zhang, Charles Sutton, Amos J Storkey, and Zoubin Ghahramani.  2012.  Continuous Relaxations for Discrete Hamiltonian Monte Carlo .   NIPS  25.


 Abstract:  Continuous relaxations play an important role in discrete optimization, but have not seen much use in approximate probabilistic inference. Here we show that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems. The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, results in new ways of estimating normalization constants (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference in difficult discrete systems. We demonstrate some of these continuous relaxation inference a</p><p>4 0.84353 <a title="2020-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic%21.html">1580 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-16-Stantastic!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Richard McElreath writes:
  
I’ve been translating a few ongoing data analysis projects into  Stan  code, mostly with success. The most important for me right now has been a hierarchical zero-inflated gamma problem. This a “hurdle” model, in which a bernoulli GLM produces zeros/nonzeros, and then a gamma GLM produces the nonzero values, using varying effects correlated with those in the bernoulli process.


The data are 20 years of human foraging returns from a subsistence hunting population in Paraguay (the Ache), comprising about 15k hunts in total (Hill & Kintigh. 2009. Current Anthropology 50:369-377). Observed values are kilograms of meat returned to camp. The more complex models contain a 147-by-9 matrix of varying effects (147 unique hunters), as well as imputation of missing values.


Originally, I had written the sampler myself in raw R code. It was very slow, but I knew what it was doing at least.

The point is that the model has enough parameters and uncertainty that you’ll want to do full Bayes (rather than some sort</p><p>6 0.81764758 <a title="2020-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-07-My_recent_debugging_experience.html">2161 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-07-My recent debugging experience</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Over the past few months, we’ve talked about modeling with particle physicists ( Allen Caldwell ), astrophysicists ( David Hogg , who regularly comments here), and climate and energy usage modelers ( Phil Price , who regularly posts here).  
 
 Big Science Black Boxes 
 
We’ve gotten pretty much the same story from all of them:  their models involve “big science” components that are hugely complex and provided by outside implementations from labs like CERN or LBL. Some concrete examples for energy modeling are the  TOUGH2  thermal simulator, the EnergyPlus building energy usage simulator, and global climate model (GCM) implementations.
 
These models have the character of not only being black boxes, but taking several seconds or more to generate the equivalent of a likelihood function evaluation.  So we can’t use something like Stan, because nobody has the person years required to implement something like TOUGH2 in Stan (and Stan doesn’t have the debugging or modularity tools to suppor</p><p>2 0.92640817 <a title="2020-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-10-%E2%80%9CVersatile%2C_affordable_chicken_has_grown_in_popularity%E2%80%9D.html">655 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-10-“Versatile, affordable chicken has grown in popularity”</a></p>

- A review by Jenny Diski of a biography of Stanley Milgram.  Diski appears to want to debunk:
  
Milgram was a whiz at devising sexy experiments, but barely interested in any theoretical basis for them.  They all have the same instant attractiveness of style, and then an underlying emptiness.

I was just going through the latest draft of  your paper with Anthony Unwin . I heard part of it at  the talk  you gave (remotely) here at UMich.  I’m curious about your discussion of the  Baby Name Voyager .


The tool in itself is simple, attractive, and useful.  No argument from me there.  It’s an awesome demonstration of how subtle interactions can be very helpful (click and it zooms, type and it filters… falls perfectly into the Shneiderman visualization mantra). It satisfies a very common use case: finding appropriate names for children.


That said, I can’t help but feeling that what you are really excited about is  the very static analysis on last letters  (you spend most of your time on this).  This analysis, incidentally, is not possible to infer from the interactive application (which doesn’t support this type of filtering and pivoting).  In a sense, the two visualizations don’t have anything to do with each other (other than a shared context/dataset).</p><p>5 0.90762776 <a title="2020-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk_worked.html">2238 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk worked</a></p>

</p><p>4 Now, the first time around I found that Chinese-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans were proportionally the most numerous Asian ethnics at the medical/dental schools of UC Irvine and USC (each about 10% of graduating classes), while Korean-Americans were a distant third (3-5%). [sent-12, score-0.154]
</p><p>5 At Loma Linda University, however, Korean-Americans were about 30% of dental school graduating classes every year and 20% of medical school graduates. [sent-13, score-0.55]
</p><p>6 Chinese- and Vietnamese-Americans, meanwhile, were in the low single digits at Loma Linda (Japanese never exceed 2% at any school, strangely enough). [sent-14, score-0.084]
</p><p>7 These results were surprising because I had expected all three schools’ Asian ethnic representation to mirror that of the region’s demographics; I thought I had made a mistake so I decided to try recoding. [sent-15, score-0.459]
</p><p>8 What I did was that I decided that I might be subconsciously over-counting Korean-Americans by coding all instances of the “Lee” surname as Korean rather than Chinese. [sent-16, score-0.259]
</p><p>9 So I decided that unless there were “ethnic” first names which could be used to identify an individual as a particular ethnicity, I would label all ambiguous cases as simply Chinese. [sent-17, score-0.243]
</p><p>10 I would only label a person with a “Lee” last name as Korean if their ethnic Korean given name was included as a marker (Korean and Chinese given names are quite distinct). [sent-19, score-0.407]
</p><p>11 After the recoding, my results were almost the same, except that the percentage of Chinese at Loma Linda University’s medical school went up to almost 10%, and the proportions of Koreans at Loma Linda University went down to 25% in the dental school and 15% in the medical school. [sent-20, score-0.559]

</p><p>13 I want to make sure about these results, because they were the stepping ground off which I undertook a qualitative study of Asian-American medical/dental students at Loma Linda University to find why the demographics at Loma Linda were so different. [sent-22, score-0.18]
</p><p>14 I found that Loma Linda University being a Seventh-Day Adventist university was the key deciding factor; the fact that Loma Linda University is a religious university encouraged self-selection among applicants as well as potential applicants to its medical/dental programs. [sent-23, score-0.65]
</p><p>15 Many non-Adventist potential applicants to Loma Linda’s programs decided against applying because they were turned off by the university’s overtly religious self-presentation; Korean-Americans are a highly Christian ethnic group, on the other hand, and so are well-represented within Adventism. [sent-24, score-0.552]
</p><p>16 The fact that Korean immigrants to America are also usually at least middle class and college-educated/professionally-trained means that they had advantages in academic achievement. [sent-25, score-0.039]
</p><p>17 I think there must be an academic literature on ethnic coding of names. [sent-29, score-0.372]

On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>4 0.072281703 <a title="1657-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-23-Participate_in_a_research_project_on_combining_information_for_prediction.html">866 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-23-Participate in a research project on combining information for prediction</a></p>

To viewers of Dr. Andrew Gelman’s blog,


I [Wallsten] am pleased to invite you to participate in an important research project to develop improved methods for predicting future events and outcomes. More specifically, our goal is to develop methods for aggregating many individual judgments in a manner that yields more accurate predictions than any one person or small group alone could provide. Our research is funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity (IARPA,  iarpa.gov ), but its application will extend far beyond intelligence to such areas as business forecasting or medical diagnosis. Our team consists of researchers at ARA, a private company; as well as researchers at the University of Maryland-College Park, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Fordham University, University of California-Irvine, Wake Forest University, and the University of Missouri.

<p>Introduction: Conservative data cruncher Charles Murray  asks , “Why aren’t Asians Republicans?”: 
  
  
Asians are only half as likely to identify themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative” as whites, and less than half as likely to identify themselves as Republicans.  . . . 70% of Asians voted for Barack Obama in the last presidential election.


Something’s wrong with this picture. . . . Everyday observation of Asians around the world reveal them to be conspicuously entrepreneurial, industrious, family-oriented, and self-reliant. If you’re looking for a natural Republican constituency, Asians should define “natural.” . . .


Asian immigrants overwhelmingly succeeded, another experience that tends to produce conservative immigrants. Beyond that, Asian minorities everywhere in the world, including America, tend to be underrepresented in politics—they’re more interested in getting ahead commercially or in non-political professions than in running for office or organizing advocacy groups.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>4 0.67131084 <a title="1657-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>5 0.66168302 <a title="1657-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-09-This_Friday_afternoon%3A__Applied_Statistics_Center_mini-conference_on_risk_perception.html">267 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-09-This Friday afternoon:  Applied Statistics Center mini-conference on risk perception</a></p>

I am a recent M.A. graduate in sociology.  I am primarily qualitative in method but have been moving in a more mixed-methods direction ever since I discovered sports analytics (Moneyball, Football Outsiders, Wages of Wins, etc.).


For my thesis I studied Korean-Americans in education in the health professions through a comparison of Asian ethnic representation in Los Angeles-area medical and dental schools. 


I did this by counting up different Asian ethnic groups at UC Irvine, USC and Loma Linda University’s medical/dental schools using surnames as an identifier (I coded for ethnicity using an algorithm from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries which correlated surnames with ethnicity: http://www.naaccr.org/Research/DataAnalysisTools.aspx). The coding was mostly easy, since “Nguyen” and “Tran” is always Vietnamese, “Kim” and “Song” is Korean, “Shimazaki” is Japanese, etc.


Now, the first time around I found that Chinese-Americans and</p><p>2 0.90695721 <a title="1657-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-18-Those_mean_psychologists%2C_making_fun_of_dodgy_research%21.html">1329 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-18-Those mean psychologists, making fun of dodgy research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two people separately sent me  this amusing mock-research paper  by Brian A. Nosek (I assume that’s what’s meant by “Arina K. Bones”).  The article is pretty funny, but  this poster  (by Nosek and Samuel Gosling) is even better!  Check it out:
 
   
 
   
 
I remarked that this was almost as good as my zombies paper, and my correspondent pointed me to  this page  of (I assume) Nosek’s research on aliens.
 
P.S.  I clicked through to take  the test  to see if I’m dead or alive, but I got bored after a few minutes.  I gotta say, if Gosling can  come up with  a 10-item measure of the Big Five, this crew should be able to come up with a reasonably valid alive-or-dead test that doesn’t require dozens and dozens of questions!</p><p>3 0.89184558 <a title="1657-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-13-Convincing_Evidence.html">1979 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-13-Convincing Evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Keith O’Rourke and I wrote  an article  that begins:
  
Textbooks on statistics emphasize care and precision, via concepts such as reliability and validity in measurement, random sampling and treatment assignment in data collection, and causal identification and bias in estimation. But how do researchers decide what to believe and what to trust when choosing which statistical methods to use? How do they decide the credibility of methods? Statisticians and statistical practitioners seem to rely on a sense of anecdotal evidence based on personal experience and on the attitudes of trusted colleagues. Authorship, reputation, and past experience are thus central to decisions about statistical procedures.
  
It’s for a volume on theoretical or methodological research on authorship, functional roles, reputation, and credibility in social media, edited by Sorin Matei and Elisa Bertino.</p><p>4 0.87324554 <a title="1657-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-29-How_to_grab_power_in_a_democracy_%E2%80%93_in_5_easy_non-violent_steps.html">116 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-29-How to grab power in a democracy – in 5 easy non-violent steps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past decades violent means of grabbing power have been discredited and internationally regulated. Still, grabbing power is as desired as it has always been, and I’d like to introduce some new methods used today:
  
 Establish your base of power by achieving a critical mass (75%+) within a group with a  high barrier to entry . Examples of barriers to entry: genetics (familiar ties, skin, eye color, hair type – takes 2+ generations to enter), religion (takes 2-10 years to enter), language (very hard to enter after the age of 10). 
 Encourage your followers to have  many children  – because of common ethical concerns, other groups will help you bring them up. 
 Control the system of  indoctrination , such as religious schooling, government-based educational system, entertainment, popular culture – limiting the loss of children to out-group (only needed for non-genetic barriers to entry). 
  Wait 18 years  for your followers’ children to become eligible to vote.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  points  to the above self-canceling statement which comes from a quantitatively-trained  expert  on international debt.  I can only assume that he was speaking quickly and that the reporter didn’t know enough to ask him to clarify.  When I’m interviewed, I emit a lot of ums, uhs, and probably quite a few meaningless remarks, but usually whoever is interviewing me knows to just keep the good stuff.  As Kaiser points out, the above quote could mean two completely opposite things!  In context I’m sure it was clear to the speaker but it’s not at all obvious what’s going on in the published version.  Again, I’m not blaming the expert here, it’s just a miscommunication that got into the article, something that Kaiser noticed (and that I care about) because of our interest in probability communication.
 
In any case, the line “at least as much as an 80 percent chance” should join “ But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable ” in the Probability Hall</p><p>6 0.83500546 <a title="1657-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-27-Average_predictive_comparisons_when_changing_a_pair_of_variables.html">1346 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-27-Average predictive comparisons when changing a pair of variables</a></p>

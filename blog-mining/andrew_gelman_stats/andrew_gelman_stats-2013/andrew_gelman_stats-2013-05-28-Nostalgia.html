<p>Introduction: “Explanation” is this thing that social scientists (or people in their everyday lives, acting like social scientists) do, where some event X happens and we supply a coherent story that concludes with X.  Sometimes we speak of an event as “overdetermined,” when we can think of many plausible stories that all lead to X.
 
My question today is:  what is explanation, in a statistical sense?
 
To understand why this is a question worth asking at all, compare to prediction.  Prediction is another thing that we all to, typically in a qualitative fashion:  I think she’s gonna win this struggle, I think he’s probably gonna look for a new job, etc.  It’s pretty clear how to map everyday prediction into a statistical framework, and we can think of informal qualitative predictions as approximations to the predictions that could be made by a statistical model (as in the  classic work  of Meehl and others on clinical vs. statistical prediction).

<p>Introduction: Life is continuous but we think in discrete terms.  In applied statistics there’s the p=.05 line which tells us whether a finding is significant or not.  Baseball has the Mendoza line.
 
And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site.

<p>Introduction: Coming back from Chicago we flew right over Manhattan.  Very impressive as always, to see all those buildings so densely packed.  But think of how impressive it must have seemed in 1950!  The world had a lot less of everything back in 1950 (well, we had more oil in the ground, but that’s about it), so Manhattan must have just seemed amazing.  I can see how American leaders of that period could’ve been pretty smug.  Our #1 city was leading the world by so much, it was decades ahead of its time, still impressive even now after 60 years of decay.</p><p>3 0.768543 <a title="1874-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-04-Peabody_here..html">2197 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-04-Peabody here.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw the trailer for the new Mr. Peabody movie and it looked terrible.  They used that weird animation where everything looks round, also the voice had none of the intonations of the “real” Peabody (for some reason, the trailer had the original English voices, maybe they didn’t get their act together to make a dubbed trailer in time for the release here), also the scenes looked pretty stupid.  I went back home and checked out Peabody on wikipedia and it turns out that they made 91 episodes!  I had no idea.
 
Anyway, here’s my real question:  Why bother making a Mr. Peabody movie if you’re not going to do it well?  I understand that lots of moviemakers are hacks and there will always be a huge audience for crap in any case, so I’m certainly not demanding that all movies be “good” (in whatever sense that means, from my perceptions).  But there are lots and lots of opportunities to make crap movies, there are a million toys and video games and comic book characters and fairy tales and br</p><p>4 0.74923772 <a title="1874-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-21-Ticket_to_Baaaath.html">2300 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-21-Ticket to Baaaath</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ooooooh, I never ever thought I’d have a legitimate excuse to tell this story, and now I do!  The story took place many years ago, but first I have to tell you what made me think of it:
 
Rasmus Bååth  posted  the following comment last month:
  
On airplane tickets a Swedish “å” is written as “aa” resulting in Rasmus Baaaath. Once I bought a ticket online and five minutes later a guy from Lufthansa calls me and asks if I misspelled my name…
  
OK, now here’s my story (which is not nearly as good).  A long time ago (but when I was already an adult), I was in England for some reason, and I thought I’d take a day trip from London to Bath.  So here I am on line, trying to think of what to say at the ticket counter.  I remember that in England, they call Bath, Bahth.  So, should I ask for “a ticket to Bahth”?  I’m not sure, I’m afraid that it will sound silly, like I’m trying to fake an English accent.  So, when I get to the front of the line, I say, hesitantly, “I’d like a ticket to Bath?</p><p>5 0.73442036 <a title="1874-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-30-Real_rothko%2C_fake_rothko.html">1553 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-30-Real rothko, fake rothko</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  writes :
  
I know that in art, quality and value are two very different things.  Still, I had to stop and wonder when I read about

 
Domenico and Eleanore De Sole, who in 2004 paid $8.3 million for a painting attributed to Mark Rothko that they now say is a worthless fake.
 

One day a painting is worth $8.3 million; the next day, the same painting – same quality, same capacity to give aesthetic pleasure or do whatever it is that art does – is “worthless.”*  Art forgery also makes me wonder about the buyer’s motive.  If the buyer wanted only to have and to gaze upon something beautiful, something with artistic merit, then a fake Rothko is no different than a real Rothko.  It seems more likely that what the buyer wants is to own something valuable – i.e., something that costs a lot. Displaying your brokerage account statements is just too crude and obvious.  What the high-end art market offers is a kind of money laundering.

<p>Introduction: Saw Argo the other day, was impressed by the way it was filmed in such a 70s style, sorta like that movie The Limey or an episode of the Rockford Files.
 
I also felt nostalgia for that relatively nonviolent era.  All those hostages and nobody was killed.  It’s a good thing the Ayatollah didn’t have some fundamentalist Shiite equivalent of John Yoo telling him to waterboard everybody.
 
At the time we were all so angry and upset about the hostage-taking, but from the perspective of our suicide-bomber era, that whole hostage episode seems so comfortingly mild.</p><p>2 0.75338823 <a title="1874-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-20-Not_quite_getting_the_point.html">1073 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-20-Not quite getting the point</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I gave  this talk  the other day and afterwards, a white guy came up to me and said he thought it was no coincidence that the researcher who made the mistake was “Oriental.”  He then went on for about 5 minutes explaining his theory.

I am working with clinicians in infectious disease and international health to study the (possible causal) relation between malnutrition and virus infection episodes (e.g., diarrhea) in babies in developing countries.


Basically the clinicians are interested in two questions: does malnutrition cause more diarrhea episodes? does diarrhea lead to malnutrition? The malnutrition status is indicated by height and weight (adjusted, HAZ and WAZ measures) observed every 3 months from birth to 1 year. They also recorded the time of each diarrhea episode during the 1 year follow-up period. They have very solid datasets for analysis.


As you can see, this is almost like a chicken and egg problem. I am a layman to causal inference. The method I use is just to do some simple regression. For example, to study the causal relation from malnutrition to diarrhea episodes, I use binary variable (diarrhea yes/no during months 0-3) as response, and use the HAZ at month 0 as covariate</p><p>4 0.71527332 <a title="1874-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-28-Does_Avastin_work_on_breast_cancer%3F_Should_Medicare_be_paying_for_it%3F.html">1032 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-28-Does Avastin work on breast cancer?

<p>Introduction: I saw this graph  posted  by Tyler Cowen:
 
   
 
and my first thought was that the bar plot should be replaced by a line plot:  Six lines, one for each income category, with each line being a time series of these changes.  With a line plot, you can more easily see each time series (these are hard to see in the barplot because you have to follow each color and jump from decade to decade) and also compare the patterns for each category.  The line plot pretty much dominates the bar plot.
 
At least that was the theory.  Now here’s what actually happened.
 
I downloaded the data as Excel files, saved them as csv, then read them into R.  In all, it took close to an hour to get the data set up in the format that was needed to make the graphs.  At this point it was pretty easy to make the line plot.  But the result was disappointing:
 
   
 
The six lines are hard to untangle (sure, a better color scheme might help, but it wouldn’t really solve the problem) and the graph as a whole is much l</p><p>6 0.61864448 <a title="1874-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-20-Cars_vs._trucks.html">527 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-20-Cars vs. trucks</a></p>

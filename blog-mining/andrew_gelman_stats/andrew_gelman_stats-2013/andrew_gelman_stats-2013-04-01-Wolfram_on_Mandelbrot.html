<p>Introduction: Mandelbrot on taxonomy  (from 1955; the first publication about fractals that I know of):
 
   
 
 Searching  for Mandelbrot on the blog led me to  Akaike , who also recently passed away and also did interesting early work on self-similar stochastic processes. 
 
For example, this wonderful opening of his 1962 paper, “On a limiting process which asymptotically produces f^{-2} spectral density”:
  
In the recent papers in which the results of the spectral analyses of roughnesses of runways or roadways are reported, the power spectral densities of approximately the form f^{-2} (f: frequency) are often treated. This fact directed the present author to the investigation of the limiting process which will provide the f^{-2} form under fairly general assumptions. In this paper a very simple model is given which explains a way how the f^{-2} form is obtained asymptotically. Our fundamental model is that the stochastic process, which might be considered to represent the roughness of the runway</p><p>3 0.17233017 <a title="1784-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-05-Glenn_Hubbard_and_I_were_on_opposite_sides_of_a_court_case_and_I_didn%E2%80%99t_even_know_it%21.html">1707 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-05-Glenn Hubbard and I were on opposite sides of a court case and I didn’t even know it!</a></p>

Glenn Hubbard, Leading Academic and Mitt Romney Advisor, Took $1200 an Hour to Be Countrywide’s Expert Witness . . . Hidden among the reams of material recently filed in connection with the lawsuit of monoline insurer MBIA against Bank of America and Countrywide is a deposition of none other than Columbia University’s Glenn Hubbard. . . . Hubbard testified on behalf of Countrywide in the MBIA suit. He conducted an “analysis” that essentially concluded that Countrywide’s loans weren’t any worse than the loans produced by other mortgage originators, and that therefore the monstrous losses that investors in those loans suffered were due to other factors related to the economic crisis – and not caused by the serial misrepresentations and fraud in Countrywide’s underwriting.
  
That’s interesting, because I worked on the other side of this case!  I was hired by MBIA’s lawyers.

Drawing from My Mind’s Eye: 
Dorothea Rockburne in Conversation with David Cohen 
Introduced by Nina Samuel
 
Thursday, November 29 
6 pm 
BGC, 38 West 86th Street
 
Benoît Mandelbrot, unusual among mathematicians of the twentieth century, harnessed the power of visual images to express his theories and to pursue new lines of thought. In this conversation artist Dorothea Rockburne will share memories of studying with mathematician Max Dehn at Black Mountain College, of meeting Mandelbrot, and discuss her recent work.
 
Exhibition curator Nina Samuel will discuss the related exhibition “The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking,” on view in the BGC Focus Gallery through January 27, 2013.
 
  
   
David Cohen is editor and publisher of artcritical.com as well as founder and moderator of The Review Panel.

<p>Introduction: Yair points us to  this  page full of wonderful graphs from the Stephen Wolfram blog.  Here are a few:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized.

<p>Introduction: I just reviewed the book Bursts, by Albert-László Barabási, for Physics Today.  But I had a lot more to say that couldn’t fit into the magazine’s 800-word limit.  Here I’ll reproduce what I sent to Physics Today, followed by my additional thoughts.
  
The back cover of Bursts book promises “a revolutionary new theory showing how we can predict human behavior.”  I wasn’t fully convinced on that score, but the book does offer a well-written and thought-provoking window into author Albert-László Barabási’s research in power laws and network theory.


Power laws–the mathematical pattern that little things are common and large things are rare–have been observed in many different domains, including incomes (as noted by economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth century), word frequencies (as noted by linguist George Zipf), city sizes, earthquakes, and virtually anything else that can be measured.  In the mid-twentieth century, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot devoted an influential caree</p><p>3 0.78665459 <a title="1784-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-05-Plagiarism%2C_Arizona_style.html">2234 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-05-Plagiarism, Arizona style</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last month a history professor sent me a note regarding plagiarism at Arizona State University:
  
Matthew Whitaker, who had received an expedited promotion to full professor and was made Director of a new Center for the Study of Race and Democracy by Provost Elizabeth Capaldi and President Michael Crow, was charged by most of the full professors in the History Faculty with having plagiarized throughout his corpus of work, copying from regular works of scholarship and from web sources. Indeed, in his response, which claimed that the petitioners were racist, Whitaker admitted to plagiarism in his work, defending himself in part by stating that he had not reviewed carefully the research and writing he had hired others to do. . . .
  
What bothered my correspondent was that Whitaker remains an ASU Foundation Professor of History despite all the plaig. According to Whitaker’s  webpage , he “is also a highly sought after speaker, having offered commentaries on NPR, PBS, . . . and other medi</p><p>4 0.7364071 <a title="1784-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-20-%E2%80%9CJoseph_Anton%E2%80%9D.html">1505 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-20-“Joseph Anton”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I only read the  review , not the book.  What puzzled me was not any  lack of self-awareness  but rather this bit:
  
The title of Mr. Rushdie’s new memoir . . . comes from the alias he assumed when British police told him back in 1989 that he needed a pseudonym: the Joseph comes from Joseph Conrad, the Anton from Anton Chekhov. The protection officers issued to him by the British government soon took to calling him “Joe,” an abbreviation he says he detested.
  
The thing that I don’t understand is why he detested the nickname.  If I were in a comparable situation, I think I’d appreciate if my security detail gave me a friendly nickname.  Then again, with the stress that Rushdie’s been under, I can imagine all sorts of personality transformations.</p><p>5 0.73237085 <a title="1784-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-05-A_review_of_a_review_of_a_review_of_a_decade.html">258 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-05-A review of a review of a review of a decade</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the sister blog, David Frum  writes , of a book by historian Laura Kalman about the politics of the 1970s:
  
 
As a work of history about the Ford and Carter years, there is nothing seriously wrong with it. The facts are accurate, the writing is clear and the point of view is not tendentious. Once upon a time, such a book might have been useful to somebody.


But the question it raises–and it’s not a question about this book alone–is: What’s the point of this kind of history in the age of the Internet? Suppose I’m an undergraduate who stumbles for the first time across the phrase “Proposition 13.” I could, if I were minded, walk over to the university library, pull this book from the shelf and flip to the index. Or I could save myself two hours and Google it. I wouldn’t learn more from a Google search than I’d learn in these pages. But I wouldn’t learn a whole lot less either.
 

 
As a textbook writer, I think about some of these issues too!

<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>6 0.84141409 <a title="1784-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive_psychology_research_helps_us_understand_confusion_of_Jonathan_Haidt_and_others_about_working-class_voters.html">1373 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive psychology research helps us understand confusion of Jonathan Haidt and others about working-class voters</a></p>

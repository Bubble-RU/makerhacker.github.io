</p><p>5 If all the research says that test scores and grades predict performance, why would the people at Google want to ignore this information? [sent-9, score-0.794]
</p><p>6 Loken continues:    There are at least two factors in play here (and again I’m assuming the folks at Google are well aware of both of these points). [sent-10, score-0.161]
</p><p>7 First, when a company has built its brand on attracting only the brightest prospective employees, through self-selection and through sheer volume of applicants the pool will be extremely competitive. [sent-11, score-0.6]
</p><p>8 Google likely doesn’t have much variability among those hired with respect to test scores and grades. [sent-12, score-0.907]
</p><p>9 And when there is no variability, there is no correlation with anything. [sent-13, score-0.179]
</p><p>10 It’s a similar argument to MIT saying that the SAT is useless for their admissions. [sent-14, score-0.115]
</p><p>11 Their applicant pool is so vast and highly qualified that the incoming class is largely homogeneous on those measures. [sent-15, score-0.583]
</p><p>12 We of course need to wonder how all those people with lower test scores and grades would have fared at Google had they been hired. [sent-17, score-0.787]
</p><p>13 But furthermore, when an organization has used a certain instrument to select their employees, the correlation with job performance goes down. [sent-18, score-0.667]
</p><p>14 It’s also that the information has already been acted upon. [sent-20, score-0.085]
</p><p>15 If someone is hired despite their lower test scores, it usually means some compelling compensating characteristics made that person look like a good bet. [sent-21, score-0.626]
</p><p>16 That is why the correlation between a valid selection instrument and job performance can be dramatically depressed when only looking at the hired sample. [sent-22, score-1.029]
</p><p>17 Loken concludes:    It’s common to misinterpret that low correlation as a sign of poor prediction. [sent-23, score-0.274]
</p><p>18 Again – thousands of research studies have confirmed the predictive validity of tests of cognitive ability for job performance. [sent-24, score-0.651]

<p>Introduction: Eric Loken  explains :
  
Some newspapers and radio stations recently picked up a story that Facebook profiles can be revealing, and can yield information more predictive of job performance than typical self-report personality questionnaires or even an IQ test. . . .


A most consistent finding from the last 50 years of organizational psychology research is that cognitive ability is the strongest predictor of job performance, sometimes followed closely by measures of conscientiousness (and recently there has been interest in perseverance or grit).  So has the Facebook study upended all this established research?  Not at all, and the reason lies in the enormous gap between the claims about the study’s outcomes, and the details of what was actually done.


The researchers had two college population samples.  In Study 1 they had job performance ratings for the part-time college jobs of about 10% of the original sample.  But in study 1 they did not have any IQ or cognitive ability measure.</p><p>3 0.20353676 <a title="1980-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-30-Berri_Gladwell_Loken_football_update.html">2082 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-30-Berri Gladwell Loken football update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sports researcher Dave Berri had a disagreement with  a remark  in our recent discussion of Malcolm Gladwell.  Berri writes:
  
This post [from Gelman] contains the following paragraph:

 
Similarly, when Gladwell claimed that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college, he appears to have been wrong. But if you take his writing as stone soup, maybe it’s valuable: just retreat to the statement that there’s only a weak relationship between draft order and NFL performance. That alone is interesting. It’s too bad that Gladwell sometimes has to make false general statements in order to get our attention, but maybe that’s what is needed to shake people out of their mental complacency.
 

The above paragraph  links  to a blog post by Eric Loken.  This is something you have linked to before.  And when you linked to it before I tried to explain why Loken’s work is not very good.  Since you still think this work shows that Gladwell – and therefore Rob</p><p>4 0.18767433 <a title="1980-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-More_data_tools_worth_using_from_Google.html">911 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-More data tools worth using from Google</a></p>

Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?

The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade.

<p>Introduction: This one is fun because I have a double conflict of interest:  I’ve been paid (at different times) both by Google and by Microsoft.
 
Here’s the story:
 
Microsoft,  September 2012 :
  
An independent research company, Answers Research based in San Diego, CA, conducted a study using a representative online sample of nearly 1000 people, ages 18 and older from across the US. The participants were chosen from a random survey panel and were required to have used a major search engine in the past month. Participants were not aware that Microsoft was involved.  


In the test, participants were shown the main web search results pane of both Bing and Google for 10 search queries of their choice. Bing and Google search results were shown side-by-side on one page for easy comparison – with all branding removed from both search engines. The test did not include ads or content in other parts of the page such as Bing’s Snapshot and Social Search panes and Google’s Knowledge Graph.

<p>Introduction: Eric Loken  writes :
  
If you’re used to Google upending conventional wisdom, then yesterday’s  interview with Laszlo Bock in the New York Times  did not disappoint. Google has determined that test scores and transcripts are useless because they don’t predict performance among its employees. . . .


I [Loken] am going to assume they’re well aware of the limits of their claim, and instead I’m going say that as readers of the interview we should not lose sight of a fundamental fact -

 
Across a wide variety of employment settings, one of the most robust findings in organizational psychology is that tests of cognitive ability are strong predictors of job performance. If Google has found otherwise, what they have found is that grades and test scores are not predictive of performance at Google. In general, in the workplace tests are still highly predictive of success.
 
  
If all the research says that test scores and grades predict performance, why would the people at Google want to igno</p><p>2 0.91817534 <a title="1980-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-17-I_got_99_comparisons_but_multiplicity_ain%E2%80%99t_one.html">1016 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-17-I got 99 comparisons but multiplicity ain’t one</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I gave  my talk  at an econ seminar on Why We (Usually) Don’t Care About Multiple Comparisons, I got the following comment:
  
One question that came up later was whether your argument is really with testing in general, rather than only with testing in multiple comparison settings.
  
My reply:
 
Yes, my argument is with testing in general.  But it arises with particular force in multiple comparisons.  With a single test, we can just say we dislike testing so we use confidence intervals or Bayesian inference instead, and it’s no problem—really more of a change in emphasis than a change in methods.  But with multiple tests, the classical advice is not simply to look at type 1 error rates but more specifically to make a multiplicity adjustment, for example to make confidence intervals wider to account for multiplicity.  I don’t want to do this!  So here there is a real battle to fight.

<p>Introduction: I love  this stuff :
  
This article presents a simulation-based method designed to establish the computational correctness of software developed to fit a specific Bayesian model, capitalizing on properties of Bayesian posterior distributions. We illustrate the validation technique with two examples. The validation method is shown to find errors in software when they exist and, moreover, the validation output can be informative about the nature and location of such errors. We also compare our method with that of an earlier approach.

You’ve probably already seen it, but I thought you could have a lot of fun with this one!!
  
 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years. We found no correlation between spouses’ automatic and conscious attitu</p><p>6 0.90946031 <a title="1980-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-03-Two_interesting_posts_elsewhere_on_graphics.html">599 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-03-Two interesting posts elsewhere on graphics</a></p>

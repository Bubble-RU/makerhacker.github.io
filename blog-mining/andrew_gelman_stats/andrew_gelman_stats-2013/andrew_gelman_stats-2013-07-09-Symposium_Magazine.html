<p>Introduction: Symposium magazine  (“Where Academia Meets Public Life”) has some fun stuff this month:
  
 Learning to Read All Over Again  
Lutz Koepnick 
What produces better students – reading in print or reading on-line? The answer is both.


 The Elusive Quest for Research Innovation  
Claude S. Fischer 
Much of what is considered “new research” has actually been around for a while. But that does not mean it lacks value.


 Science Journalism and the Art of Expressing Uncertainty  
Andrew Gelman 
It is all too easy for unsupported claims to get published in scientific publications. How can journalists address this?

<p>Introduction: Here .  (Background  here .)
 
P.S.  Just a thought:  is it possible that one reason for the effectiveness of relief pitchers is that, by the end of the game, the starting players (that is, the hitters who have been playing all game) are getting tired?  Iâ&euro;&trade;m pretty sure that lots of baseball-statistics experts will know the answer to this.</p><p>4 0.095746338 <a title="1930-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism_as_a_form_of_voluntarism.html">482 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Capitalism as a form of voluntarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  by Alex Tabarrok (following up on an article by Rebecca Solnit) on the continuum between voluntarism (or, more generally, non-cash transactions) and markets with monetary exchange.  I just have a few comments of my own:
 
1.  Solnit writes of “the iceberg economy,” which she characterizes as “based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return . . . the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit.”  I just wonder whether “barter” completely fits in here.  Maybe it depends on context.  Sometimes barter is an informal way of keeping track (you help me and I help you), but in settings of low liquidity I could imagine barter being simply an inefficient way of performing an economic transaction.
 
2.  I am no expert on capitalism but my impression is that it’s not just about “competition and selfishness” but also is related to the</p><p>5 0.090280108 <a title="1930-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-08-Of_parsing_and_chess.html">1847 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-08-Of parsing and chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus  writes ,
  
An algorithm that is good at chess won’t help parsing sentences, and one that parses sentences likely won’t be much help playing chess.
  
That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.  I’d much rather have had twice as much detail on the first part of the life and then had the post-1972 era compr</p><p>6 0.079097629 <a title="1930-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-%E2%80%9CThe_Case_for_Inductive_Theory_Building%E2%80%9D.html">1652 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-“The Case for Inductive Theory Building”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by  David K. Park 
 
Even though I’m an engineer with a PhD in political science, I tend to gravitate toward history to anchor my contextual lens. (If fact, if I were pressed to put a methodological stake in the ground, I would say I’m a historical comparative institutional ecologist.) In that regard, it may be helpful to situate this discussion within the broader historical arc of intellectual pursuits at universities. As we know with the birth of universities, we had scholars who embodied so many disciplines such as mathematics, philosophy, religion law, etc into one individual. Then in the 50′s and 60′s we started going into hyper-specialization mode, and it was necessary because we needed to better understand our specific domains. In the 80s and 90s, certain disciplines started to recognize the importance of other disciplines on their work but the tendency was to bring those skills into a single individual. So we produced, by way of e.g., law professors who could do ga</p><p>3 0.71364444 <a title="1930-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-20-We_are_what_we_are_studying.html">1947 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-20-We are what we are studying</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins  writes :
  
When native Australians or New Guineans say that their totemic animals and plants are their kinsmen – that these species are persons like themselves, and that in offering them to others they are giving away part of their own substance – we have to take them seriously, which is to say empirically, if we want to understand the large consequences of these facts for how they organise their lives. The graveyard of ethnographic studies is strewn with the remains of reports which, thanks to anthropologists’ own presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact, were content to ignore or debunk the Amazonian peoples who said that the animals they hunted were their brothers-in-law, the Africans who described the way they systematically killed their kings when they became weak, or the Fijian chiefs who claimed they were gods.
  
My first thought was . . . wait a minute!  Whazzat with “presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact”?  That a</p><p>4 0.70907497 <a title="1930-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-12-Steven_Pinker%E2%80%99s_unconvincing_debunking_of_group_selection.html">1414 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-12-Steven Pinker’s unconvincing debunking of group selection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .


I [Pinker] am often asked whether I agree with the new group selectionists, and the q</p><p>5 0.69360447 <a title="1930-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-17-In_the_best_alternative_histories%2C_the_real_world_is_what%E2%80%99s_ultimately_real.html">2251 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-17-In the best alternative histories, the real world is what’s ultimately real</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  amusing-yet-so-true video directed by Eléonore Pourriat shows a sex-role-reversed world where women are in charge and men don’t get taken seriously.  It’s convincing and affecting, but the twist that interests me comes at the end, when the real world returns.  It’s really creepy.
 
And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat’s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don’t think would’ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.

I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.

<p>Introduction: Symposium  is a new online magazine subtitled “Where academia meets public life.”  You can think of it as a sort of Slate magazine without Mickey Kaus, or as the Atlantic without the stylish writing.
 
Here are the articles in the first issue, which has just been posted:
 
 Why Write the History of Capitalism?  
Louis Hyman 
A new generation of scholars is rewriting the story of capitalism by shaking off the old assumptions of both the Left and Right.
 
 Sorry, Wrong Number  
Andrew Gelman 
How do bad numbers get into circulation in our political discourse, and how do they stay there, even after being refuted?
 
 Historians and the Problem of Miracles  
Scott K. Taylor 
Historians, like most academics, are a secular lot. Is this a bias that prevents a deeper understanding of religious history?
 
 The Rebirth of Viewing Pleasure  
Jill Dolan 
By taking a fresh look at popular culture, students are breathing new life into feminist theories of a generation ago.

<p>Introduction: My upstairs colleague Blattman  writes :
  
The trend is unsurprising. Schools have every incentive to move to the highest four or five piles [grades] possible. . . . Then grade inflation will stop because . . there will be nowhere to go. . . . So why resist the new equilibrium?
  
I don’t have any argument for resisting, but I don’t think everything’s quite so simple as Chris is saying.
 
First, you can easily get compression so that almost everyone gets the same grade (“A”).  So, no four or five piles.
 
Second, the incentives for grading high have been there for awhile.  To me, the more interesting question is:  how is it that grade inflation hasn’t gone faster?  Why would it take so many decades to reach a natural and obvious equilibrium?  Here’s what I wrote  last year : 
   
As a teacher who, like many others, assigns grades in an unregulated environment (that is, we have no standardized tests and no rules on how we should grade), all the incentives to toward giving only A’s:  Wh</p><p>6 0.90059638 <a title="1930-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-09-Using_ranks_as_numbers.html">136 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-09-Using ranks as numbers</a></p>

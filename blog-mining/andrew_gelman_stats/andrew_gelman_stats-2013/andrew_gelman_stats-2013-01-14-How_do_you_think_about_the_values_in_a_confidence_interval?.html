As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.


Please note I am not referring to credible intervals, but rather to the common medical journal reporting standard of confidence intervals.

</p><p>8 For most of the examples I’ve ever seen, this interpretation is pretty useless because the goal is to learn about the situation we have right now in front of us, not merely to make a statement with certain average properties. [sent-8, score-0.287]
</p><p>9 I would say that the usual interpretation of a confidence interval is as a set of parameter values that are consistent with the data. [sent-9, score-1.326]
</p><p>10 Typically the values near the center of the interval are more consistent, and sometimes this idea is formalized by thinking about hypothetical nested 1%, 2%, 3%, …, 99% intervals, where the more central parameter values are in more of these intervals. [sent-10, score-1.285]
</p><p>11 The real problem is that the interval will exclude the true value at least 5% of the time. [sent-11, score-0.534]

<p>Introduction: 11. Here is the result of fitting a logistic regression to Republican vote in the 1972 NES.
 
   
 
Income is on a 1â&euro;&ldquo;5 scale. Approximately how much more likely is a person in income category 4 to vote Republican, compared to a person income category 2? Give an approximate estimate, standard error, and 95% interval.
 
 Solution to question 10 
 
From  yesterday :
  
10. Out of a random sample of 100 Americans, zero report having ever held political office. From this information, give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have ever held political office.
  
Solution:  Use the Agresti-Coull interval based on (y+2)/(n+4).  Estimate is p.hat=2/104=0.02, se is sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/104)=0.013, 95% interval is [0.02 +/- 2*0.013] = [0,0.05].</p><p>6 0.21496633 <a title="1672-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-15-Problematic_interpretations_of_confidence_intervals.html">2248 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-15-Problematic interpretations of confidence intervals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 10. Out of a random sample of 100 Americans, zero report having ever held political office. From this information, give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have ever held political office.
 
 Solution to question 9 
 
From  yesterday :
  
9. Out of a population of 100 medical records, 40 are randomly sampled and then audited. 10 out of the 40 audits reveal fraud. From this information, give an estimate, standard error, and 95% confidence interval for the proportion of audits in the population with fraud.
  
Solution:  estimate is p.hat=10/40=0.25.  Se is sqrt(1-f)*sqrt(p.hat*(1-.hat)/n)=sqrt(1-0.4)*sqrt(0.25*0.75/40)=0.053.  95% interval is [0.25 +/- 2*0.053] = [0.14,0.36].</p><p>6 0.70544052 <a title="1672-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-15-Problematic_interpretations_of_confidence_intervals.html">2248 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-15-Problematic interpretations of confidence intervals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The economy isn’t going so well, but there are some interesting possibilities here at Columbia University.  One such option that you should be thinking about is the  Earth Institute Fellowship , which pays well, includes a research stipend, and puts you in an exciting interdisciplinary community of faculty and postdoctoral researchers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia brings in several postdocs each year–it’s a two-year gig–and some of them have been statisticians (recently, Kenny Shirley and Leontine Alkema).  We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health.  It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.  The EI postdoc can be a place to do interesting work and begin a research career.
 
If you’re a statistician who’s interested in this fellowship, feel free to contact me directly–you have to apply to the Earth Institute directly (see link above), but I’m happy to give you advice about</p><p>2 0.97086304 <a title="1672-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-02-RStudio_%E2%80%93_new_cross-platform_IDE_for_R.html">597 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-02-RStudio – new cross-platform IDE for R</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The new R environment  RStudio  looks really great, especially for users new to R. In teaching, these are often people new to programming anything, much less statistical models. The R GUIs were different on each platform, with (sometimes modal) windows appearing and disappearing and no unified design. RStudio fixes that and has already found a happy home on my desktop.
 
   
  Initial impressions  
I’ve been using it for the past couple of days. For me, it replaces the niche that R.app held: looking at help, quickly doing something I don’t want to pollute a project workspace with; sometimes data munging, merging, and transforming; and prototyping plots.  RStudio is better than R.app at all of these things.  For actual development and papers, though, I remain wedded to emacs+ess (good old  C-x M-c M-Butterfly ). 
  Favorite features in no particular order

<p>Introduction: Panos Ipeirotis  writes in his blog  post :
  

Everyone who has attended a conference knows that the quality of the talks is very uneven. There are talks that are highly engaging, entertaining, and describe nicely the research challenges and solutions. And there are talks that are a waste of time. Either the presenter cannot present clearly, or the presented content is impossible to digest within the time frame of the presentation.


We already have reviewing for the written part. The program committee examines the quality of the written  paper and vouch for its technical content. However, by looking at a paper it is impossible to know how nicely it can be presented. Perhaps the seemingly solid but boring paper can be a very entertaining presentation. Or an excellent paper may be written by a horrible presenter.


Why not having a second round of reviewing, where the authors of accepted papers submit their presentations (slides and a YouTube video) for presentation to the conference.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.966838 <a title="1672-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-14-How_do_you_think_about_the_values_in_a_confidence_interval%3F.html">1672 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-14-How do you think about the values in a confidence interval?</a></p>

As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.


Please note I am not referring to credible intervals, but rather to the common medical journal reporting standard of confidence intervals.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  this post  by Noah Smith on economics in science fiction, Mark Palko  writes  on economics in crime fiction.
 
Just as almost all science fiction is ultimately about politics, one could say that just about all crime fiction is about economics.
 
But if I had to pick one crime novelist with an economics focus, Iâ&euro;&trade;d pick George V. Higgins.  In one of his novels, his character Jerry Kennedy had a riff on the difference between guys who get a salary and guys who have to work for every dollar.  But, really, almost all his novels are full of economics.</p><p>6 0.96606845 <a title="1672-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>

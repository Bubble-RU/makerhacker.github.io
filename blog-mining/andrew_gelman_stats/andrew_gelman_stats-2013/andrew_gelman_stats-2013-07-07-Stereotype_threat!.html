At one point I have a browser open with the itinerary I’m interested in, and then awhile later I reopen the window (not clicking on anything on the page, just bringing the window up on the screen) but it’s timed out again.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>4 0.085240208 <a title="1929-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-14-Don%E2%80%99t_look_at_just_one_poll_number%E2%80%93unless_you_really_know_what_you%E2%80%99re_doing%21.html">276 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-14-Don’t look at just one poll number–unless you really know what you’re doing!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a good one if you want to tell your students about question wording bias.  It’s fun because the data are all on the web–the research is something that students could do on their own–if they know what to look for.  Another win for Google.
 
Here’s the story.  I found the following graph on the front page of the American Enterprise Institute, a well-known D.C. think tank:
 
 
 
My first thought was that they should replace this graph by a time series, which would show so much more information.  I did a web search and, indeed, looking at a broad range of poll questions over time gives us a much richer perspective on public opinion about Afghanistan than is revealed in the above graph.
 
I did a quick google search (“polling report afghanistan”) and found  this .  The quick summary is that roughly 40% of Americans favor the Afghan war (down from about 50% from 2006 through early 2009).
 
The Polling Report page also features the Quninipiac poll featured in the above graph; here it r</p><p>5 0.081824064 <a title="1929-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-03-Counting_gays.html">1404 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-03-Counting gays</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gary Gates   writes :
  
In a recent study, the author of this article estimated that the self- identified lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community makes up 3.8 percent of the American population. The authorâ&euro;&trade;s estimate was far lower than many scholars and activists had contended, and it included a relatively high proportion of persons self-identifying as bisexuals. This article responds to two of the central criticisms that arose in the controversy that followed. First, in response to claims that his estimate did not account for people who are in the closet, the author describes how demographers might measure the size of the closet. Second, in response to those who either ignored the reported large incidence of bisexuality or misconstrued the meaning of that incidence, the Author considers how varying frameworks for conceptualizing sexual orientation might alter the ratio of lesbian or gay individuals to bisexuals.

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>3 0.73048663 <a title="1929-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-More_on_those_L.A._Times_estimates_of_teacher_effectiveness.html">226 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-More on those L.A. Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: I’m thinking more and more that we have to get rid of statistical significance, 95% intervals, and all the rest, and just come to a more fundamental acceptance of uncertainty.
 
In practice, I think we use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests as a way to avoid acknowledging uncertainty. We set up some rules and then act as if we know what is real and what is not. Even in my own applied work, I’ve often enough presented 95% intervals and gone on from there. But maybe that’s just not right.
 
I was thinking about this after receiving the following email from a psychology student: 
  
  
I [the student] am trying to conceptualize the lessons in  your paper with Stern  with comparing treatment effects across studies.

<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

<p>Introduction: Colleen Ganley, Leigh Mingle, Allison Ryan, Katherine Ryan, Marian Vasilyeva, and Michelle Perry  write :
  
Stereotype threat has been proposed as 1 potential explanation for the gender difference in standardized mathematics test performance among high-performing students. At present, it is not entirely clear how susceptibility to stereotype threat develops, as empirical evidence for stereotype threat effects across the school years is inconsistent. In a series of 3 studies, with a total sample of 931 students, we investigated stereotype threat effects during childhood and adolescence. Three activation methods were used, ranging from implicit to explicit. Across studies, we found no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat. In 2 of the studies, there were gender differences on the mathematics assessment regardless of whether stereotype threat was activated. Potential reasons for these findings are discussed, including the possibil</p><p>2 0.86544257 <a title="1929-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-15-World_record_running_times_vs._distance.html">1011 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-15-World record running times vs. distance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Julyan Arbel  plots  world record running times vs. distance (on the log-log scale):
 
   
 
The line has a slope of 1.1.  I think it would be clearer to plot speed vs. distance—then you’d get a slope of -0.1, and the numbers would be more directly interpretable.
 
Indeed,  this paper  by Sandra Savaglio and Vincenzo Carbone (referred to in the comments on Julyan’s blog) plots speed vs. time.  Graphing by speed gives more resolution:
 
   
 
The upper-left graph in the grid corresponds to the human running records plotted by Arbel.  It’s funny that Arbel sees only one line whereas Savaglio and Carbone see two—but if you remove the 100m record at one end and the 100km at the other end, you can see two lines in Arbel’s graph as well.  The bottom two graphs show swimming records.   Knut  would probably have something to say about all this.</p><p>3 0.8367191 <a title="1929-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-07-Martyn_Plummer%E2%80%99s_Secret_JAGS_Blog.html">1045 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-07-Martyn Plummer’s Secret JAGS Blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martyn Plummer , the creator of the open-source, C++, graphical-model compiler  JAGS  (aka “Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), runs a forum on the JAGS site that has a very similar feel to the mail-bag posts on this blog.  Martyn answers general statistical computing questions (e.g., why slice sampling rather than Metropolis-Hastings?) and general modeling (e.g., why won’t my model converge with this prior?).
 
Here’s the link to the top-level JAGS site, and to the forum:
  
   JAGS Forum 
    JAGS Home Page 
   
The forum’s pretty active, with the stats page showing hundreds of views per day and very regular posts and answers.  Martyn’s last post was today.
 
Martyn also has a blog devoted to JAGS and other stats news:

<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>5 0.76156914 <a title="1929-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-More_bad_news%3A__The_%28mis%29reporting_of_statistical_results_in_psychology_journals.html">933 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-More bad news:  The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another entry in the growing literature on systematic flaws in the scientific research literature.
 
This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data. Regrettably, only 24% of the authors shared their data, despite our request</p><p>6 0.74748522 <a title="1929-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-12-More_frustrations_trying_to_replicate_an_analysis_published_in_a_reputable_journal.html">1054 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-12-More frustrations trying to replicate an analysis published in a reputable journal</a></p>

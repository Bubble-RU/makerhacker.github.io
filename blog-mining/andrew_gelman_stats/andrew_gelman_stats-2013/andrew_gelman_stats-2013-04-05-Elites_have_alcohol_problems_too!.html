Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.

</p><p>10 ”  They attribute this correlation to the fact that alcohol abuse is easier to detect among drivers (for example, they’ve had their license revoked), and lower-income people are less likely to drive a car. [sent-46, score-0.764]
</p><p>11 But even if the correlation between alcohol problems and income is zero or slightly negative, this still leaves lots of high-SES Americans—”elites,” in Cowen’s words—who are seriously impaired by alcoholism. [sent-47, score-0.581]

<p>Introduction: I had no idea this sort of thing even existed:
 
   
 
I’m reminded of our  discussion  of Charles Murray’s recent book on social divisions among Americans.  Murray talked about differences between upper and lower class, but I thought he was really talking more about differences between liberals and conservatives among the elite.  (More discussion  here .)
 
In this particular case, Murray’s story about irresponsible elites seems to fit pretty well.  At the elite level, you have well-connected D.C. gun lobbyists opposing any restrictions on personal weapons.  As Murray might put it, the elites (Phil Spector aside) may be able to handle their guns, but some lower-class Americans cannot—they do things like give real rifles to 5-year-olds (!).  As Murray writes, it’s a combination of cultural ignorance and a permissive ideology:  I assume the senators who voted against the recent gun control bill wouldn’t give live weapons to  their  kids (or live in neighborhoods in which kids have acces</p><p>3 0.14774296 <a title="1789-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>4 0.13263819 <a title="1789-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-23-Voting_patterns_of_America%E2%80%99s_whites%2C_from_the_masses_to_the_elites.html">1227 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-23-Voting patterns of America’s whites, from the masses to the elites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Within any education category, richer people vote more Republican. In contrast, the pattern of education and voting is nonlinear. High school graduates are more Republican than non-HS grads, but after that, the groups with more education tend to vote more Democratic. At the very highest education level tabulated in the survey, voters with post-graduate degrees lean toward the Democrats. Except for the rich post-graduates; they are split 50-50 between the parties.
 
What does this say about America’s elites? If you define elites as high-income non-Hispanic whites, the elites vote strongly Republican. If you define elites as college-educated high-income whites, they vote moderately Republican.
 
There is no plausible way based on these data in which elites can be considered a Democratic voting bloc. To create a group of strongly Democratic-leaning elite whites using these graphs, you would need to consider only postgraduates (no simple college grads included, even if they have achieved s</p><p>5 0.12250514 <a title="1789-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-12-Improvement_of_5_MPG%3A_how_many_more_auto_deaths%3F.html">708 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-12-Improvement of 5 MPG: how many more auto deaths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This entry was posted by Phil Price. 
 
	A colleague is looking at data on car (and SUV and light truck) collisions and casualties.  He’s interested in causal relationships.  For instance, suppose car manufacturers try to improve gas mileage without decreasing acceleration.  The most likely way they will do that is to make cars lighter.  But perhaps lighter cars are more dangerous; how many more people will die for each mpg increase in gas mileage?
 
	There are a few different data sources, all of them seriously deficient from the standpoint of answering this question.  Deaths are very well reported, so if someone dies in an auto accident you can find out what kind of car they were in, what other kinds of cars (if any) were involved in the accident, whether the person was a driver or passenger, and so on.  But it’s hard to normalize:  OK, I know that N people who were passengers in a particular model of car died in car accidents last year, but I don’t know how many passenger-miles that</p><p>6 0.10930075 <a title="1789-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-03-Booze%3A_Been_There._Done_That..html">2158 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-03-Booze: Been There.

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>4 0.79918873 <a title="1789-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-27-The_most_dangerous_jobs_in_America.html">1086 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-27-The most dangerous jobs in America</a></p>

On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard.

Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>5 0.78153408 <a title="1789-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-17-More_on_the_difficulty_of_%E2%80%9Cpreaching_what_you_practice%E2%80%9D.html">1325 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-17-More on the difficulty of “preaching what you practice”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>6 0.77598119 <a title="1789-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-07-Duncan_Watts_and_the_Titanic.html">1370 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-07-Duncan Watts and the Titanic</a></p>

Iâ&euro;&trade;ve heard about plagiarism but I had no idea it occurred in political science.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88677108 <a title="1789-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>3 0.22822939 <a title="1721-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-04-%E2%80%9CTo_find_out_what_happens_when_you_change_something%2C_it_is_necessary_to_change_it.%E2%80%9D.html">186 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-04-“To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the classic Box, Hunter, and Hunter book.  The point of the saying is pretty clear, I think:  There are things you learn from perturbing a system that you’ll never find out from any amount of passive observation.  This is not always true–sometimes “nature” does the experiment for you–but I think it represents an important insight.
 
I’m currently writing (yet another) review article on causal inference and am planning use this quote.
 
P.S.  I find it helpful to write these reviews for a similar reason that I like to blog on certain topics over and over, each time going a bit further (I hope) than the time before.  Beyond the benefit of communicating my recommendations to new audiences, writing these sorts of reviews gives me an excuse to explore my thoughts in more rigor.
 
P.P.S.  In the original version of this blog entry, I correctly attributed the quote to Box but I incorrectly remembered it as “No understanding without manipulation.”  Karl Broman (see comment below) gave me</p><p>4 0.12519538 <a title="1721-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>5 0.12320542 <a title="1721-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-25-Classics_of_statistics.html">109 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-25-Classics of statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert is  planning  a graduate seminar in which students read 15 classic articles of statistics.  (See  here  for more details and a slightly different list.)
 
Actually, he just writes “classics,” but based on his list, I assume he only wants articles, not books.  If he wanted to include classic books, I’d nominate the following, just for starters: 
- Fisher’s Statistical Methods for Research Workers 
- Snedecor and Cochran’s Statistical Methods 
- Kish’s Survey Sampling 
- Box, Hunter, and Hunter’s Statistics for Experimenters 
- Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Cleveland’s The Elements of Graphing Data 
- Mosteller and Wallace’s book on the Federalist Papers. 
Probably Cox and Hinkley, too.  That’s a book that I don’t think has aged well, but it seems to have had a big influence.
 
I think there’s a lot more good and accessible material in these classic books than in the equivalent volume of classic articles.

I am a recent graduate looking for a bit of advice. While I took intro classes on math and statistics in my undergraduate degree as a political science major, I find myself university-less and seeking to develop my statistics toolkit.


I work for an NGO in the international development field. I think that a solid statistics foundation would offer me not only more career opportunities, but more importantly, a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the processes and problems that interest me. Iâ&euro;&trade;m talking about field experiments and practical quantitative and qualitative data analysis.


I have plenty of free time, ambition, and enthusiasm to improve this part of my toolbox, but I lack an attachment to an institution and much in the way of financial resources.

<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>4 0.75745398 <a title="1721-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-More_bad_news%3A__The_%28mis%29reporting_of_statistical_results_in_psychology_journals.html">933 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-More bad news:  The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Another entry in the growing literature on systematic flaws in the scientific research literature.
 
This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data. Regrettably, only 24% of the authors shared their data, despite our request</p><p>5 0.74004054 <a title="1721-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-02-Graphical_communication_for_legal_scholarship.html">1096 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-02-Graphical communication for legal scholarship</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following  my talk  on infovis and statistical graphics at the  Empirical Legal Studies conference , Dan Kahan writes:
  
The legal academy, which is making strides toward sensible integration of a variety of empirical methods into its scholarship, is horribly ignorant of the utility of graphic reporting of data, a likely influence of the formative influence that econometric methods has exerted on expectations and habits of mind among legal scholars. Lee Epstein has written a pair of wonderful articles on graphic reporting –

<p>Introduction: Someone who works in statistics in the pharmaceutical industry (but prefers to remain anonymous) sent me  this update  to our discussion on the differences between approvals of drugs and medical devices:
  
The ‘substantial equivalence’ threshold is a very outdated. Basically the FDA has to follow federal law and the law is antiquated and leads to two extraordinarily different paths for device approval.


You could have a very simple but first-in-kind device with an easy to understand physiological mechanism of action (e.g. the FDA approved a simple tiny stent that would relieve pressure from a glaucoma patient’s eye this summer).  This device would require a standard (likely controlled) trial at the one-sided 0.025 level. Even after the trial it would likely go to a panel where outside experts (e.g.practicing & academic MDs and statisticians) hear evidence from the company and FDA and vote on its safety and efficacy.  FDA would then rule, consider the panel’s vote, on whether to appro</p><p>2 0.96961308 <a title="1721-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-14-Learning_how_to_speak.html">1938 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-14-Learning how to speak</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>3 0.92877591 <a title="1721-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-To_commenters_who_are_trying_to_sell_something.html">839 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-To commenters who are trying to sell something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Three different people have pointed me to  this post  by Ken Regan on statistical evaluation of claims of cheating in chess.  So I figured I have to satisfy demand and post something on this.  But I have nothing to say.  All these topics interest me, but I somehow had difficulty reading through the entire post.  I scanned through but what I really wanted to see was some data.  Show me a scatterplot, then I’ll get interested.
 
P.S.  This is meant as no disparagement of Regan or his blog.  I just couldn’t quite get into this particular example.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92294395 <a title="1721-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-13-A_must-read_paper_on_statistical_analysis_of_experimental_data.html">1721 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-13-A must-read paper on statistical analysis of experimental data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points to an  excellent article  on statistical experimentation by Ron Kohavi, Alex Deng, Brian Frasca, Roger Longbotham, Toby Walker, Ya Xu, a group of software engineers (I presume) at Microsoft.  Kohavi et al. write:
  
Online controlled experiments are often utilized to make data-driven decisions at Amazon, Microsoft . . . deployment and mining of online controlled experiments at scale—thousands of experiments now—has taught us many lessons.
  
The paper is well written and has excellent examples (unfortunately the substantive topics are unexciting things like clicks and revenue per user, but the general principles remain important).  The ideas will be familiar to anyone with experience in practical statistics but don’t always make it into textbooks or courses, so I think many people could learn a lot from this article.  I was disappointed that they didn’t cite much of the statistics literature— not even the classic Box, Hunter, and Hunter book on industrial experimentat</p><p>6 0.91693377 <a title="1721-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-20-When_Kerry_Met_Sally%3A_Politics_and_Perceptions_in_the_Demand_for_Movies.html">358 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-20-When Kerry Met Sally: Politics and Perceptions in the Demand for Movies</a></p>

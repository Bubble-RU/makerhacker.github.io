<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

P.S.  I don’t make any money through this link.  We do get some royalties from the book, but only a very small amount.  I’m pushing the Amazon link right now because (a) I think the book is great, and I want as many people as possible to have it, and (b) 40% off is a pretty good deal and I don’t know how long this will last.
 
P.P.S.  Just so this post has some statistical content,  here’s one of my favorite papers , Bayesian model-building by pure thought: some principles and examples.

<p>Introduction: Now that you have some free time again, you’ll have to check out  these books  and tell us if they’re worth reading.
 
Claire Kirch  reports :
  
Lizzie Skurnick Books launches in September with the release of Debutante Hill by Lois Duncan. The novel, which was originally published by Dodd, Mead, in 1958, has been out of print for about three decades.


The other books on the initial list, all reissues, are A Long Day in November by Ernest J. Gaines (originally published in 1971), Happy Endings Are All Alike by Sandra Scoppettone (1979), I’ll Love You When You’re More Like Me by M.E. Kerr (1977), Secret Lives by Berthe Amoss (1979), To All My Fans, With Love, From Sylvie by Ellen Conford (1982), and Me and Fat Glenda by Lila Perl (1972). . . .


Noting that many of the books of that era beloved by teen boys are still in print – such as Isaac Asimov’s novels and The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier – Skurnick pointed out that, in contrast, many of the books that were embraced by teen gir</p><p>3 0.60295916 <a title="1993-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-Bayes_in_China_update.html">517 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-Bayes in China update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>4 0.59573096 <a title="1993-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-23-Learning_Differential_Geometry_for_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo.html">1339 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-23-Learning Differential Geometry for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You can get a taste of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) by reading the very gentle introduction in David MacKay’s general text on information theory:
  
  MacKay, D.  2003.    Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms  .  Cambridge University Press.  [see Chapter 31, which is relatively standalone and can be downloaded separately.]
   
Follow this up with Radford Neal’s much more thorough introduction to HMC:
  
 Neal, R. 2011.   MCMC Using Hamiltonian Dynamics .  In Brooks, Gelman, Jones and Meng, eds.,  Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo .  Chapman and Hall/CRC Press.
   
To understand why HMC works and set yourself on the path to understanding generalizations like  Riemann manifold HMC , you’ll need to know a bit about differential geometry.  I really liked the combination of these two books:
  
  Magnus, J. R. and H. Neudecker.  2007.   Matrix Differential Calculus with Application in Statistics and Econometrics .  3rd Edition.  Wiley?
   
and

Dear Colleague,


Recently we informed you about SciRev, our new website where researchers can share their experiences with the peer review process and select an efficient journal for submitting their work. 


Since our start, we already received over 500 reviews and many positive reactions, which reveal a great need for comparable information on duration and quality of the review process. All reviews are publicly available on our website, both at the pages of the journals and in an overview at www.scirev.sc/reviews


To make this venture a success, many reviews are needed. We therefore would appreciate it very much if you could take a few minutes to visit our website www.SciRev.sc and share your recent review experiences with your colleagues.


SciRev also offers you the possibility to create a free account where you can administer your manuscripts under review and create a personal journal list.


Thanks on behalf of the research community,

<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>2 0.90798289 <a title="1993-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-07-Whassup_with_phantom-limb_treatment%3F.html">457 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-07-Whassup with phantom-limb treatment?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, here’s something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who’s famous for his innovative treatment for “phantom limb” pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . “Oh, my God!” the man began</p><p>3 0.85526204 <a title="1993-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-04-At_the_politics_blogs_._._..html">990 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-04-At the politics blogs . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 10. Out of a random sample of 100 Americans, zero report having ever held political office. From this information, give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have ever held political office.
 
 Solution to question 9 
 
From  yesterday :
  
9. Out of a population of 100 medical records, 40 are randomly sampled and then audited. 10 out of the 40 audits reveal fraud. From this information, give an estimate, standard error, and 95% confidence interval for the proportion of audits in the population with fraud.
  
Solution:  estimate is p.hat=10/40=0.25.  Se is sqrt(1-f)*sqrt(p.hat*(1-.hat)/n)=sqrt(1-0.4)*sqrt(0.25*0.75/40)=0.053.  95% interval is [0.25 +/- 2*0.053] = [0.14,0.36].</p><p>5 0.8076219 <a title="1993-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.

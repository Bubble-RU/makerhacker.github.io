<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta points me to  “EigenBracket 2012: Using Graph Theory to Predict NCAA March Madness Basketball”  and writes, “I [Folta] have got to believe that he’s simply re-invented a statistical method in a graph-ish context, but don’t know enough to judge.”
 
I have not looked in detail at the method being presented here—I’m not much of college basketball fan—but I’d like to use this as an excuse to make one of my favorite general point, which is that a good way to characterize any statistical method is by what information it uses. 
   
The basketball ranking method here uses score differentials between teams in the past season.  On the plus side, that is better than simply using one-loss records (which (a) discards score differentials and (b) discards information on who played whom).  On the minus side, the method appears to be discretizing the scores (thus throwing away information on the exact score differential) and doesn’t use any external information such as external ratings.

<p>Introduction: This is an echo of yesterday’s post,  Basketball Stats: Don’t model the probability of win, model the expected score differential .
 
As with basketball, so with baseball:  as the great Bill James wrote, if you want to predict a pitcher’s win-loss record, it’s better to use last year’s ERA than last year’s W-L.
 
As with basketball and baseball, so with epidemiology:  as Joseph Delaney  points out  in my favorite blog that nobody reads, you will see much better prediction if you first model change in the parameter (e.g. blood pressure) and then convert that to the binary disease state (e.g. hypertension) then if you just develop a logistic model for prob(hypertension).
 
As with basketball, baseball, and epidemiology, so with political science:  instead of modeling election winners, better to model vote differential, a point that I made back in 1993 (see page 120  here ) but which seems to continually need  repeating .

<p>Introduction: After posting that  announcement  about Civis Analytics, I wrote, “If a reconstituted Romney Analytics team is hiring, let me know and I’ll post that ad too.”  Adam Schaeffer  obliged :
  

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.


We’re looking for new talent to help with our fast-growing portfolio in these areas:

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.  As I  wrote last month , I respe</p><p>3 0.8607198 <a title="1923-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-The_hare%2C_the_pineapple%2C_and_Ed_Wegman.html">1307 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-The hare, the pineapple, and Ed Wegman</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenters here are occasionally bothered that I spend so much time attacking frauds and plagiarists.  See, for example,  here  and  here .  Why go on and on about these losers, given that there are more important problems in the world such as war, pestilence, hunger, and graphs where the y-axis doesn’t go all the way down to zero?
 
Part of the story is that I do research for a living so I resent people who devalue research through misattribution or fraud, in the same way that rich people don’t like counterfeiters.
 
What really bugs me, though, is when cheaters get caught and still don’t admit it.  People like Hauser, Wegman, Fischer, and Weick get under my skin because they have the chutzpah to just deny deny deny.  The grainy time-stamped videotape with their hand in the cookie jar is right there, and they’ll still talk around the problem.  Makes me want to scream.
 
This happens  all the time .  All. Over. The. Place.
 
Everybody makes mistakes, and just about everybody does thing</p><p>4 0.85068965 <a title="1923-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-11-Debutante_Hill.html">1977 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-11-Debutante Hill</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was curious  so I ordered a used copy.  It was pretty good.  It fit in my pocket and I read it on the plane.  It was written in a bland, spare manner, not worth reading for any direct insights it would give into human nature, but the plot moved along.  And the  background material  was interesting in the window it gave into the society of the 1950s.  It was fun to read a book of pulp fiction that didnâ&euro;&trade;t have any dead bodies in it.
 
I wonder what Jenny Davidson would think of it.</p><p>5 0.84878838 <a title="1923-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-09-Hey%E2%80%94here%E2%80%99s_a_photo_of_me_making_fun_of_a_silly_infographic_%28from_last_year%29.html">1613 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-09-Hey—here’s a photo of me making fun of a silly infographic (from last year)</a></p>

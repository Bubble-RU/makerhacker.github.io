<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.1397227 <a title="2146-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-25-A_statistical_graphics_course_and_statistical_graphics_advice.html">2266 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-25-A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

<p>Introduction: From  Chris Mulligan:
 
   
 
The data come from the Center for Disease Control and cover the years 1969-1988. Chris also gives instructions for how to download the data and plot them in R from scratch (in 30 lines of R code)!
 
 And now, the background 
 
A few months ago I heard about a study reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days:
 
   
 
I  wrote ,
  
What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns. While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates. It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.
  
I was pointed to some tables:

<p>Introduction: 1.  I  remarked  that Sharad had a good research article with some ugly graphs.
 
2.  Dan  posted  Sharad’s graph and some unpleasant alternatives, inadvertently associating me with one of the unpleasant alternatives.  Dan was comparing barplots with dotplots.
 
3.  I  commented  on Dan’s site that, in this case, I’d much prefer a well-designed lineplot.  I wrote:
  
There’s a principle in decision analysis that the most important step is not the evaluation of the decision tree but the decision of what options to include in the tree in the first place.


I think that’s what’s happening here. You’re seriously limiting yourself by considering the above options, which really are all the same graph with just slight differences in format. What you need to do is break outside the box.

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.  It represents neither a dat</p><p>3 0.82974011 <a title="2146-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-One_more_time-use_graph.html">671 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-One more time-use graph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.

<p>Introduction: Under the subject line “Blog bait!”, Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  post at the Washington Post blog:
  
For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.


    
Infographic by Thomas Porostocky for WIRED.


“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>5 0.81566179 <a title="2146-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Why_display_6_years_instead_of_30%3F.html">1258 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Why display 6 years instead of 30?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to be the go-to guy for bad graphs.  Today (i.e., 22 Feb), I received an email from Gary Rosin:
  
I [Rosin] thought you might be interested in  this  graph showing the decline in median prices of homes since 1997. It exaggerates the  proportions by using $150,000 as the floor, rather than zero.
  
Indeed.  Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
A line plot, rather than a bar plot, would be appropriate here.  Also, it’s weird that the headline says “10 years” but the graph has only 6 years.

<p>Introduction: They didn’t have room for  all four graphs  of the time-series decomposition so they just  displayed  the date-of-year graph:
 
 
 
They rotated so the graph fit better on the page.  The rotation worked for me, but I was a bit bummed that that they put the title and heading of the graph (“The birthrate tends to drop on holidays . . .”) on the left in the Mar-Apr slot, leaving no room to label Leap Day and April Fool’s.  I suggested to the graphics people that they put the label at the very top and just shrink the rest of the graph by 5 or 10% so as to not take up any more total space.  Then there’d be plenty of space to label Leap Day and April Fool’s.  But they didn’t do it, maybe they felt that it wouldn’t look good to have the label right at the top, I dunno.</p><p>2 0.90966952 <a title="2146-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual 
 
If you’d like to learn more, the   Stan User’s Guide and Reference Manual   is the place to start.</p><p>3 0.85910976 <a title="2146-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-23-Can%E2%80%99t_Stop_Won%E2%80%99t_Stop_Mister_P_Beatdown.html">2074 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-23-Can’t Stop Won’t Stop Mister P Beatdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Highton and Matt Buttice point us to  this response  addressing some of the issues Jeff Lax  raised  in his most recent MRP post.
 
P.S.  Jeff replies in comments:
  
It sounds like we’ve converged. They acknowledge MRP performance is significantly better on average than reported in their new paper in PA and yet performance variation in terms of correlation to “truth” remains higher than some might have thought.
  
Cool.  I hope this sort of blog exchange can be a model of scientific discussion.  Instead of a paper just sitting there by itself, it can be openly explored.  Ideally, the published paper would include a link to these discussions of Highton, Buttice, Lax, Phillips, and Ghitza, so that readers would automatically get all this information.</p><p>4 0.85874093 <a title="2146-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>5 0.85033011 <a title="2146-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-11-Weakly_informative_priors_for_Bayesian_nonparametric_models%3F.html">1454 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-11-Weakly informative priors for Bayesian nonparametric models?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nathaniel Egwu writes:
  
I am a PhD student working on machine learning using artificial neural networks . . . Do you have some recent publications related to how one can construct priors depending on the type of input data available for training? I intend to construct a prior distribution for a given trade-off parameter of my non model obtained through training a neural network. At this stage, my argument is due to the fact that Bayesian nonparameteric estimation offers some insight on how to proceed on this problem.
  
As I’ve been writing here for awhile, I’ve been interested in weakly informative priors.  But I have little experience with nonparametric models.  Perhaps Aki Vehtari or David Dunson or some other expert on these models can discuss how to set them up with weakly informative priors?  This sounds like it could be important to me.</p><p>6 0.84979761 <a title="2146-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-One_more_time-use_graph.html">671 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-One more time-use graph</a></p>

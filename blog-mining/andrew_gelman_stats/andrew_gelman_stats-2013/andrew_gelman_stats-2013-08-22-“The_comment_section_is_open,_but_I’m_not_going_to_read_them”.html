I find these sorts of things fun to read, but the horrible thing is that I just get worse and worse as a player.  I seem to have lost the ability to automatically filter out the worst moves.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
Texas has begun to enforce [a law regarding parallel parking] only recently . . . Up until now, of course, there has been strong net mobility into the state of Texas, so was the previous lack of enforcement so bad?
  
I care not at all about the direction in which people park their cars and I have no opinion on this law, but I have to raise an alarm at Cowen’s argument here.
 
Let me strip it down to its basic form:
 
1.  Until recently, state X had policy A.
 
2.  Up until now, there has been strong net mobility into state X
 
3.  Therefore, the presumption is that policy A is ok.
 
In this particular case, I think we can safely assume that parallel parking regulations have had close to zero impact on the population flows into and out of Texas.  More generally, I think logicians could poke some holes into the argument that 1 and 2 above imply 3.  For one thing, you could apply this argument to  any  policy in any state that’s had positive net migration.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  hypothesizes  a “dogmatism portfolio” or a “quota of dogmatism”:  in his words,
  
If you’re very dogmatic in one area, you may be less dogmatic in others.
  
OK, well “may be” is pretty vague.  There’s not really anything to disagree with, yet.  But then Cowen continues:
  
 
There’s a lesson here.  If you wish to be a more open-minded thinker, adhere to some extreme and perhaps unreasonable fandoms, the more firmly believed the better and the more obscure the area the better.  This will help fulfill your dogmatism quota, yet without much skewing your more important beliefs.
 

 
He seems to be making a testable prediction here, that levels of dogmatism on two randomly chosen issues should be negatively correlated.  I guess I should call this “almost testable,” as it still requires an issue-by-issue measure of dogmatism.  (Is it dogmatic to believe that there was this guy called Jesus who walked on water . . . or is it dogmatic to say that Jesus  didn’t  walk on water and</p><p>6 0.15550783 <a title="1994-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Dodging_the_diplomats.html">232 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Dodging the diplomats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Our apartment is from earlier in the century, so I can’t give Tyler Cowen’s  first answer , but, after that, I follow him in thinking of the several books I have from that decade.  Beyond that, lemme think . . . We occasionally play  Risk , and our set dates from the 50s.  Some kitchen implements (a mixmaster, a couple of cookbooks, who knows which old bowls, forks, etc).  Probably some of the furniture, although I don’t know which.  Probably some of the items in our building (the boiler?)  What else, I wonder?  There are probably a few things I’m forgetting.
 
50-60 years is a long time, I guess.
 
P.S. to the commenters:  I’m taking the question to refer to things manufactured  in  the 1950s and not before!</p><p>4 0.75481319 <a title="1994-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-ARM_solutions.html">240 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>5 0.75087124 <a title="1994-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-20-5_books_book.html">1222 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-20-5 books book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

<p>Introduction: After I gave  my talk  at an econ seminar on Why We (Usually) Don’t Care About Multiple Comparisons, I got the following comment:
  
One question that came up later was whether your argument is really with testing in general, rather than only with testing in multiple comparison settings.
  
My reply:
 
Yes, my argument is with testing in general.  But it arises with particular force in multiple comparisons.  With a single test, we can just say we dislike testing so we use confidence intervals or Bayesian inference instead, and it’s no problem—really more of a change in emphasis than a change in methods.  But with multiple tests, the classical advice is not simply to look at type 1 error rates but more specifically to make a multiplicity adjustment, for example to make confidence intervals wider to account for multiplicity.  I don’t want to do this!  So here there is a real battle to fight.

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, when we deal with scientists, statisticians are often put in a setting reminiscent of Arrow’s paradox, where we are asked to provide estimates that are informative and unbiased and confidence statements that are correct conditional on the data and also on the underlying true parameter. [It's not generally possible for an estimate to do all these things at the same time -- ed.]  Larry Wasserman feels that scientists are truly frequentist, and Don Rubin has told me how he feels that scientists interpret all statistical estimates Bayesianly. I have no doubt that both Larry and Don are correct. Voters want lower taxes and more services, and scientists want both Bayesian and frequency coverage; as the saying goes, everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.98209739 <a title="1994-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-%E2%80%9CThe_comment_section_is_open%2C_but_I%E2%80%99m_not_going_to_read_them%E2%80%9D.html">1994 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-“The comment section is open, but I’m not going to read them”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>5 0.98022985 <a title="1994-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics_%28with_all_the_discussions%21%29.html">1712 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (with all the discussions!)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My article with Cosma Shalizi has appeared in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.  I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.
 
 Here’s the issue of the journal , which also includes an introduction, several discussions, and a rejoinder:

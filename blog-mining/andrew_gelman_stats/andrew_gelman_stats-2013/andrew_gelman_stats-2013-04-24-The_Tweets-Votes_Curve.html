We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion.

<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery talk sense  here .  I am perhaps too influenced by Steven Rosenstoneâ&euro;&trade;s 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections, which is the first thing I read on the topic.  In any case, I agree with Nyhan and Montgomery that the difference in vote, comparing a centrist candidate to an extreme candidate, is probably on the order of 1-2%, not the 4% that has been posited by some.
 
Among other things, ideological differences between candidates of the same party might seem big in the primaries, but then when the general election comes along, party ID becomes more important.

<p>Introduction: Michael Axelrod writes: 
  
  
Quantitative historian Allan Lichtman claims to have discovered 13 predictors that determine who will win the popular vote in presidential elections. He predicts Obama will win in 2012. Writing in his New York Times column, “538,” Nate Silver attempted a critique Lichtman’s prediction. Soon afterward Lichtman wrote a rejoinder. Evidently Lichtman has correctly and publicly predicted the popular vote winners in the last 7 presidential elections. I think he predicted Gore would win in 2000. He got the popular vote winner right, but not electoral college vote winner. Lichtman presents his methods in his early 1980s book, “The Keys to the White House.” Lichtman consulted with Volodia Keilis-Borok, and used a kernel discriminant analysis approach on election results from 1860-1980 as the training set. I think there is some argument as to scoring because Lichtman claims more than 7 successes. I guess he divided the data into a training and validation sets and w</p><p>3 0.78879851 <a title="1823-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-10-Translating_into_Votes%3A_The_Electoral_Impact_of_Spanish-Language_Ballots.html">406 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-10-Translating into Votes: The Electoral Impact of Spanish-Language Ballots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Hopkins sends along  this article :
  
[Hopkins] uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the turnout and election impacts of Spanish-language assistance provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Analyses of two different data sets – the Latino National Survey and California 1998 primary election returns – show that Spanish-language assistance increased turnout for citizens who speak little English. The California results also demonstrate that election procedures an influence outcomes, as support for ending bilingual education dropped markedly in heavily Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with Spanish-language assistance. The California analyses find hints of backlash among non-Hispanic white precincts, but not with the same size or certainty. Small changes in election procedures can influence who votes as well as what wins.
  
Beyond the direct relevance of these results, I find this paper interesting as an example of research that is fundamentally quantitative.

The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>5 0.75842303 <a title="1823-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happene</p><p>6 0.75721234 <a title="1823-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-16-What_I_learned_from_those_tough_538_commenters.html">210 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-16-What I learned from those tough 538 commenters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas points me to  this excellently-titled working paper  by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen, and himself:
  
Is social media a valid indicator of political behavior? We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion. With over 500 million active users in 2012, Twitter now represents a new frontier for the study of human behavior. This research provides a framework for incorporating this emerging medium into the computational social science toolkit.

<p>Introduction: Michael Spagat notifies me that his article criticizing the 2006 study of Burnham, Lafta, Doocy and Roberts has  just been published .  The Burnham et al. paper (also called, to my irritation (see the last item  here ), “the Lancet survey”) used a cluster sample to estimate the number of deaths in Iraq in the three years following the 2003 invasion.  In his newly-published paper, Spagat writes:
  
[The Spagat article] presents some evidence suggesting ethical violations to the survey’s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent. Breaches of minimal disclosure standards examined include non-disclosure of the survey’s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design. The paper also presents some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories. This evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or</p><p>3 0.94606149 <a title="1823-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-21-Roller_coasters%2C_charity%2C_profit%2C_hmmm.html">157 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-21-Roller coasters, charity, profit, hmmm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan writes:
  
 Here  is a very interesting article form Science that reports result of experiment that looked at whether people bought a product (picture of themselves screaming or vomiting on roller coaster) or paid more for it when told “1/2 to charity.” Answer was “buy more” but “pay lots 
less” than when alternative was fixed price w/ or w/o charity; and “buy more”  & “pay more” if consumer could name own price & 1/2 went to charity than if none went to charity. Pretty interesting.
  
But . . .
  
 
What’s odd, I [Kahan] think, is the measure used to report the result. The paper (written by some really amazingly good social psychologists; I know this from other studies) goes on & on, w/ figures & tables, about how the amusement park’s “revenue,” “revenue per ride” & “profit” went up by large amount when it used “name your own price & 1/2 to charity.” Yet that result is dominated by random effects — the marginal cost & volume of sales are peculiar to the product being sold &</p><p>4 0.94508362 <a title="1823-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-18-Psychology_experiments_to_understand_what%E2%80%99s_going_on_with_data_graphics%3F.html">1811 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-18-Psychology experiments to understand what’s going on with data graphics?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ricardo Pietrobon writes, regarding my  post  from last year on attitudes toward data graphics,
  
Wouldn’t it be the case to start formally studying the usability of graphics from a cognitive perspective? with platforms such as the mechanical turk it should be fairly straightforward to test alternative methods and come to some conclusions about what might be more informative and what might better assist in supporting decisions. btw, my guess is that these two constructs might not necessarily agree with each other.
  
And Jessica Hullman provides some background: 
  
  
Measuring success for the different goals that you hint at in your article is indeed challenging, and I don’t think that most visualization researchers would claim to have met this challenge (myself included).

<p>Introduction: Interesting  discussion  by Berk Ozler (which I found following  links  from Tyler Cowen) of a study by Erwin Bulte, Lei Pan, Joseph Hella, Gonne Beekman, and Salvatore di Falco that compares two agricultural experiments, one blinded and one unblinded.  Bulte et al. find much different results in the two experiments and attribute the difference to expectation effects (when people know they’re receiving an experiment they behave differently); Ozler is skeptical and attributes the different outcomes to various practical differences in implementation of the two experiments.
 
I’m reminded somehow of the  notorious  sham experiment on the dead chickens, a story that was good for endless discussion in my Bayesian statistics class last semester.  I think we can all agree that dead chickens won’t exhibit a placebo effect.  Live farmers, though, that’s another story.
 
I don’t have any stake in this particular fight, but on quick reading I’m sympathetic to Ozler’s argument that this all is wel</p><p>6 0.9424696 <a title="1823-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

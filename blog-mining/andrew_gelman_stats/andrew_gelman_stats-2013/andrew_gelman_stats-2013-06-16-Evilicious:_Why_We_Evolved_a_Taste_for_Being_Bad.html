<p>Introduction: Noam Chomsky elicits a lot of emotional reactions.  I’ve talked with some linguists who think Chomsky’s been a real roadblock to research in recent decades.  Other linguists love Chomsky, but I think they’re the kind of linguists I wouldn’t spend much time talking with.  Many people admire Chomsky’s political activism, but sociologist blogger Fabio Rojas  distinguishes  “the Chomsky’s of the world who sit around and speechify about the man” from the good guys, “the academics whose work leads to tangible improvements.”
 
When Thomas Basbøll sent me this note,
  
I [Basbøll] wonder if you react in the same (sympathetic) way to  these  remarks by Chomsky [text  here ] as I do. I think he’s right that something happens to research when “applications” come into view.

<p>Introduction: Following up on our recent  discussion  of combative linguist Noam Chomsky and disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser, here are  some stories  from Jay Livingston about monkey research.
 
Don’t get me wrong—I eat burgers, so I’m not trying to get on my moral high horse here.  But the stories do get you thinking about measurement error and why I would  not  trust the PI of a monkey study to code his own measurements and keep his data secret.</p><p>4 0.27594772 <a title="1901-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-Mmm%2C_statistical_significance_._._._Evilicious%21.html">2354 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-Mmm, statistical significance . . .

<p>Introduction: Just in case you didn’t check Retraction Watch yet  today , Carolyn Johnson reports:
  
The committee painstakingly reconstructed the process of data analysis and determined that Hauser had changed values, causing the result to be statistically significant, an important criterion showing that findings are probably not due to chance.
  
As the man  said :
  
His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
  
As a statistician, I don’t mind if someone is attacked because of cheating with data.
 
Johnson concludes her news article in a pleasantly balanced way:
  
The committee said it carefully considered Hauser’s allegation that people in his laboratory conspired against him, due to academic rivalry and disgruntlement, but did not find evidence to support the idea.


The committee also acknowledged that many of Hauser’s overall findings about the cognitive abilities of animals may stand. His results that showed that animals</p><p>5 0.2250316 <a title="1901-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-28-Colorless_green%2C_and_clueless.html">168 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-28-Colorless green, and clueless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Faithful readers will know that my ideal alternative career is to be an editor in the Max Perkins mold.  If not that, I think I’d enjoy being a literary essayist, someone like Alfred Kazin or Edmund Wilson or Louis Menand, who could write about my favorite authors and books in a forum where others would read and discuss what I wrote.  I could occasionally collect my articles into books, and so on.  On the other hand, if I actually had such a career, I wouldn’t have much of an option to do statistical research in my spare time, so I think for my own broader goals, I’ve gotten hold of the right side of the stick.
 
As it is, I enjoy writing about literary matters but it never quite seems worth spending the time to do it right.  (And, stepping outside myself, I realize that I have a lot more to offer the world as a statistician than literary critic.  Criticism is like musicianship–it can be hard to do, and it’s impressive when done well, but a lot of people can do it.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Anthony  tells the excellent story  of how Nick Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman shot down some particularly silly work in psychology.  (“According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.”  And, yes, the work they were shooting down really is that bad.)
 
If you want to see what the fuss is about, just google “2.9013.”   Here’s  an example (from 2012) of an uncritical reporting of the claim,  here’s  another one from 2010,  here’s  one from 2011 . . . well, you get the idea.
 
And  here’s a quick summary  posted by Rolf Zwaan after Brown et al. came out with their paper.
 
I know Sokal and Brown and so this story was not news to me.  I didn’t post anything about it on this blog because it seemed like it was getting enough coverage elsewhere.

<p>Introduction: An offhand mention in  this  recent post motivated me to google Evilicious. And  this  is what I found:
 
 
 
From the prologue:
  
The idea I [Hauser] develop is that evildoers are made in much the same way that addicts are made. Both processes start with unsatisfied desires. Whether it is a taste for violence or a taste for alcohol, drugs, food, or gambling, individuals develop cravings but find the desired experience less and less rewarding, a separation between desire and reward that leads to excess. To justify the excess, the psychology of desire recruits the psychology of denial, enabling individuals to immerse themselves in a new reality that feels right.
  
Interesting. This could be an excellent book. I imagine that the author has a lot of insight into this psychological state of immersing oneself in a new reality that feels right. Or maybe we all do this. In any case, thinking about extreme evil (what Hauser calls “gratuitous cruelty”) is helpful in developing a sense of pers</p><p>4 0.68204314 <a title="1901-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-19-Chomsky_chomsky_chomsky_chomsky_furiously.html">1812 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-19-Chomsky chomsky chomsky chomsky furiously</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just finished reading an amusing but somewhat disturbing  article  by Mark Singer, a reporter for the New Yorker who follows in that magazine’s tradition of writing about amiable frauds.  (For those who are keeping score at home, Singer employs a McKelway-style relaxed tolerance rather than Liebling-style pyrotechnics.)  Singer’s topic was a midwestern dentist named Kip Litton who fradulently invented a side career for himself as a sub-3-hour marathoner.  What was amazing was not so much that Litton lied about his accomplishments but, rather, the huge efforts that he undertook to support these lies.  He went to faraway cities to not run marathons.  He fabricated multiple personas on running message boards.  He even invented an entire marathon and made up a list of participants.
 
This got me thinking about Ed Wegman (sorry!), the statistician who got tangled in a  series of plagiarism scandals .  As with Litton, once Wegman was caught once, energetic people looked at the records and</p><p>6 0.67337996 <a title="1901-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-13-Retractions%2C_retractions%3A__%E2%80%9Cleft-wing_enough_to_not_care_about_truth_if_it_confirms_their_social_theories%2C_right-wing_enough_to_not_care_as_long_as_they%E2%80%99re_getting_paid_enough%E2%80%9D.html">1415 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-13-Retractions, retractions:  “left-wing enough to not care about truth if it confirms their social theories, right-wing enough to not care as long as they’re getting paid enough”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>2 0.80047446 <a title="1901-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-21-Value-added_assessment_political_FAIL.html">1274 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-21-Value-added assessment political FAIL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jimmy points me to a  sequence of posts  (Analyzing Released NYC Value-Added Data Parts 1, 2, 3, 4) by Gary Rubinstein slamming value-added assessment of teachers.
 
A skeptical consensus seems to have arisen on this issue.  The teachers groups don’t like the numbers and it seems like none of the reformers trust the numbers enough to defend them.  Lots of people like the  idea  of evaluating teacher performance, but I don’t see anybody out there wanting to seriously defend the numbers that are being pushed out here.
 
P.S.  Just to be clear, I’m specifically addressing the problems arising in value assessment of individual teachers.  I’m not criticizing the interesting research by Jonah Rockoff and others on the distribution of teacher effects.  It’s a lot easier to estimate the distribution of a set of parameters than to estimate the parameters individually.</p><p>3 0.77782488 <a title="1901-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-The_Three_Golden_Rules_for_Successful_Scientific_Research.html">166 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>4 0.72862983 <a title="1901-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-20-Job_opening_at_an_organization_that_promotes_reproducible_research%21.html">1990 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-20-Job opening at an organization that promotes reproducible research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was told about an organization called Reproducibility Initiative.  They tell me they are trying to make what was described in our “50 shades of gray”  post  standard across all of science, particularly areas like cancer research.  I don’t know anything else about them, but that sounds like a good start!

<p>Introduction: I love reading the kind of English that English people write.  It’s the same language as American but just slightly different.  I was thinking about this recently after coming across this footnote from “Yeah Yeah Yeah:  The Story of Modern Pop,” by Bob Stanley:
  
Mantovani’s atmospheric arrangement on ‘Care Mia’, I should add, is something else.  Genuinely celestial.  If anyone with a degree of subtlety was singing, it would be quite a record.
  
It’s hard for me to pin down exactly what makes this passage specifically English, but there’s something about it . . .
 
P.S.  Mark Liberman  reports  that, in combination, several of the words and phrases in the above quote indeed supply strong evidence (“odds of better than 50 to 1 in favor of a British origin”).</p><p>6 0.69205308 <a title="1901-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-06-Research_Directions_for_Machine_Learning_and_Algorithms.html">747 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-06-Research Directions for Machine Learning and Algorithms</a></p>

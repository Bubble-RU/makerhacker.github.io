<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.080821015 <a title="1747-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-18-Psychology_experiments_to_understand_what%E2%80%99s_going_on_with_data_graphics%3F.html">1811 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-18-Psychology experiments to understand what’s going on with data graphics?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ricardo Pietrobon writes, regarding my  post  from last year on attitudes toward data graphics,
  
Wouldn’t it be the case to start formally studying the usability of graphics from a cognitive perspective? with platforms such as the mechanical turk it should be fairly straightforward to test alternative methods and come to some conclusions about what might be more informative and what might better assist in supporting decisions. btw, my guess is that these two constructs might not necessarily agree with each other.
  
And Jessica Hullman provides some background: 
  
  
Measuring success for the different goals that you hint at in your article is indeed challenging, and I don’t think that most visualization researchers would claim to have met this challenge (myself included). Visualization researchers may know the user psychology well when it comes to certain dimensions of a graph’s effectiveness (such as quick and accurate responses), but I wouldn’t agree with this statement as a gene</p><p>4 0.079908565 <a title="1747-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-12-Too_tired_to_mock.html">1800 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-12-Too tired to mock</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email with the subject line “A terrible infographic,” and it went on from there:  “Given some of your recent writing on infovis, I thought you might get a kick out of this . . . I’m certainly sympathetic to their motivations, but some of these plots do not aid understanding…  To pick on a few in particular, the first plot attached, cropped from the infographic, is a strange alternative to a bar plot.  For the second attachment, I still don’t understand what they’ve plotted. . . .”
 
I agree with everything he wrote, but this point I think I’m getting too exhausted to laugh at graphs unless there is an obvious political bias to point to.</p><p>5 0.078539349 <a title="1747-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-27-A_use_for_tables_%28really%29.html">372 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-27-A use for tables (really)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>6 0.076533601 <a title="1747-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-30-Strings_Attached%3A_Untangling_the_Ethics_of_Incentives.html">1093 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-30-Strings Attached: Untangling the Ethics of Incentives</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein sends along  this bit of research , distinguishing terms used in two different subfields of psychology.  Dan writes:
  
Intuitive calls included not listing words that don’t occur 3 or more times in both programs. I [Dan] did this because when I looked at the results, those cases tended to be proper names or arbitrary things like header or footer text.  It also narrowed down the space of words to inspect, which means I could actually get the thing done in my copious free time.
  
I think the bar graphs are kinda ugly, maybe there’s a better way to do it based on classifying the words according to content?  Also the whole exercise would gain a new dimension by comparing several areas instead of just two.  Maybe that’s coming next.</p><p>3 0.77211463 <a title="1747-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful_Line_Charts.html">1125 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful Line Charts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I stumbled across a chart that’s in my opinion the best way to express a comparison of quantities through time:
 
   
 
It  compares  the new PC companies, such as Apple, to traditional PC companies like IBM and Compaq, but on the same scale. If you’d like to see how iPads and other novelties compare, see  here . I’ve tried to use the same type of visualization in my old work on  legal data visualization .
 
  
 
It comes from a new market research firm Asymco that also produced a very clean  income vs expenses  visualization (click to enlarge):
 
   
 
While the first figure is pure perfection, Tufte purists might find the second one too colorful. But to a busy person, color helps tell things apart: when I know that pink means interest, it takes a fraction of the second to assess the situation. We live in 2012, not in 1712 to have to think black and white.

I [Kahan] saw it at  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-100-year-march-of-technology-in-1-graph/255573/  , which misidentified the source (not “visual economics”;   visualizingeconomics   .com ,  which attributes it  to  Nicholas Felton , who apparently condensed  this version , which I worry could cause a stroke). But it did have a good write-up that (I’m glad) caught my attention.


It made me [Kahan] start to wonder about what sorts of qualities of a technology will influence its dissemination & also about the availability of benchmarks for proliferation of various sorts of things (e.g, fads & trends, health-promoting behaviors, knowledge of a scientific discovery) that one could use to gauge how meaningful the apparent increase in rates of proliferation of these technologies has been over time.

<p>Introduction: Yaming Yu and Xiao-Li Meng  write in  with a cool new idea for improving the efficiency of Gibbs and Metropolis in multilevel models:
  
For a broad class of multilevel models, there exist two well-known competing parameterizations, the centered parameterization (CP) and the non-centered parameterization (NCP), for effective MCMC implementation. Much literature has been devoted to the questions of when to use which and how to compromise between them via partial CP/NCP. This article introduces an alternative strategy for boosting MCMC efficiency via simply interweaving—but not alternating—the two parameterizations. This strategy has the surprising property that failure of both the CP and NCP chains to converge geometrically does not prevent the interweaving algorithm from doing so. It achieves this seemingly magical property by taking advantage of the discordance of the two parameterizations, namely, the sufficiency of CP and the ancillarity of NCP, to substantially reduce the Markovian</p><p>2 0.93433189 <a title="1747-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-%E2%80%9CTo_Rethink_Sprawl%2C_Start_With_Offices%E2%80%9D.html">1029 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-“To Rethink Sprawl, Start With Offices”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
  
Just to throw some Richard Florida in the mix:  Back in 1990, I  turned down  a job offer from Bell Labs, larg</p><p>3 0.9296447 <a title="1747-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-16-%E2%80%9CFor_individuals_with_wine_training%2C_however%2C_we_find__indications_of_a_positive_relationship_between_price_and_enjoyment%E2%80%9D.html">470 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-16-“For individuals with wine training, however, we find  indications of a positive relationship between price and enjoyment”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this blog post quotes the second line of the abstract of Goldstein et al.’s much ballyhooed 2008 tech report,  Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?  Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings .  
 
The first sentence of the abstract is
  

Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.

  
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the easy target wine snobs make, the popular press has picked up on the first sentence of the tech report.  For example, the  Freakonomics blog/radio entry  of the same name quotes the first line, ignores the qualification, then concludes
  

Wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons, and urging you to spend $15 instead of $50 on your next bottle of wine. Go ahead, take the money you save and blow it on the lottery.

  
In case you’re wondering about whether to buy me a cheap or expensive bottle of wine, keep in mind I’ve had classical “wine training”.

<p>Introduction: Sam Roberts  writes :
  
The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92052925 <a title="1747-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-03-More_research_on_the_role_of_puzzles_in_processing_data_graphics.html">1747 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-03-More research on the role of puzzles in processing data graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ruth Rosenholtz of the department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT writes:
  
 We mostly do  computational modeling of human vision.  We try to do on the one hand the sort of basic science that fits in the human vision community, while on the other hand developing predictive models which might actually lend insight into design.  


 Your talk  resonated with me in part because of  this paper  [Do Predictions of Visual Perception Aid Design?, by Ruth Rosenholtz, Amal Dorai, and Rosalind Freeman].  We went into our study thinking that people would like to have a quantitative tool to help analyze designs.  But what we concluded, somewhat anecdotally, was that its main use seemed to be as a conversation-starter, and a means of communicating ideas about the design.  And  the reason it seemed to work is that our visualizations were the right level of a “puzzle” — challenging enough to be a bit fun to work out.

Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got. Also kindly note that I can buy 1 to 50 links from one site – so you should understand the scale of the project. If you have multiple sites with co</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites.

Greetings, 
My name is Bryan Clark, and I’m a big fan of your writing. I contacted you because I think I have a mutually beneficial agreement that will allow you to make additional money for articles you are already writing online. Let me give you an idea of how we can help each other. 
We’re looking for writers that can help increase the profile of our clients by linking to them within the context of their articles. The clients are huge, and we generally have one that can fit naturally in the context of most article niches. 
In return, we pay generously for a single link for our clients. 
If you are interested, I’d love to talk about it more.

Hello,


I am interested in placing a text link on your page: http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/. The link would point to a page on a website that is relevant to your page and may be useful to your site visitors. We would be happy to compensate you for your time if it is something we are able to work out.


The best way to reach me is through a direct response to this email. This will help me get back to you about the right link request. Please let me know if you are interested, and if not thanks for your time. Thanks.
  
Usually I just ignore these, but after our recent  discussion  I decided to reply.  I wrote:
  
How much do you pay?
  
But no answer.  I wonder what’s going on?  I mean, why bother sending the email in the first place if you’re not going to follow up?</p><p>4 0.16002126 <a title="1871-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-11-Note_to_semi-spammers.html">199 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-11-Note to semi-spammers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just deleted another comment that seemed reasonable but was attached to an advertisement.
 
Here’s a note to all of you advertisers out there:  If you want to leave a comment on this site, please do so  without  the link to your website on search engine optimization or whatever.  Or else it will get deleted.  Which means you were wasting your time in writing the comment.
 
I want your comments and I don’t want you to waste your time.  So please just stop already with the links, and we’ll both be happier.
 
P.S.  Don’t worry, you’re still not as bad as the journal Nature (see the P.S.  here ).</p><p>5 0.14614289 <a title="1871-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-02-Blogads_update.html">1240 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-02-Blogads update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reported  on someone who wanted to insert text links into the blog.  I asked her how much they would pay and got no answer.
 
Yesterday, though, I received this reply:
  
Hello Andrew,


I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I’d like to make a proposal for your site. Please refer below.


We would like to place a simple text link ad on page http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/  to link to *** with the key phrase ***.


We will incorporate the key phrase into a sentence so it would read well. Rest assured it won’t sound obnoxious or advertorial. We will then process the final text link code as soon as you agree to our proposal. 


We can offer you $200 for this with the assumption that you will keep the link “live” on that page for 12 months or longer if you prefer.


Please get back to us with a quick reply on your thoughts on this and include your Paypal ID for payment process.  Hoping for a positive response from you.

<p>Introduction: I received the following email, subject line “Want to Buy Text Link from andrewgelman.com”: 
  
  
Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got. Also kindly note that I can buy 1 to 50 links from one site – so you should understand the scale of the project. If you have multiple sites with co</p><p>2 0.90704638 <a title="1871-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-28-When_Small_Numbers_Lead_to_Big_Errors.html">434 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-28-When Small Numbers Lead to Big Errors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I’d share an old story.
 
About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn’t have the data, to which his boss replied: “I know what the numbers are.”
 
Nowadays we call this sort of thing “imputation” and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p><p>4 0.86478412 <a title="1871-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Deducer_update.html">211 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Deducer update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.


Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users can learn and p</p><p>5 0.85453188 <a title="1871-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-01-Huff_the_Magic_Dragon.html">1293 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-01-Huff the Magic Dragon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Upon reading  this , Susan remarked, “Don’t you think it’s interesting that a guy who promotes smoking has a last name of ‘Huff’?  Reminds me of the Dennis/Dentist studies.”
 
Good point.
 
P.S.  As discussed in the linked thread, the great statistician R. A. Fisher was notorious for minimizing the risks of smoking.  How does this connect to Fisher’s name, one might ask?</p><p>6 0.8536467 <a title="1871-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-15-Reputations_changeable%2C_situations_tolerable.html">1858 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-15-Reputations changeable, situations tolerable</a></p>

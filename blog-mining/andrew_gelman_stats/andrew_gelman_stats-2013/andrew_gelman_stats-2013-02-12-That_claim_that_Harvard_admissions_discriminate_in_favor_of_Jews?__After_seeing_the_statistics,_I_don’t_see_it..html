</p><p>3 Sure, Unz’s reasoning can be questioned on the edges:  Ivy League schools draw more students from the Northeast, and Unz’s estimates are only approximate. [sent-24, score-0.211]
</p><p>4 What percentage of Harvard College students are Jewish? [sent-30, score-0.183]
</p><p>5 Using the scale-up methods, you get an estimate that 10-11% of students at Harvard are Jewish, not 25%. [sent-34, score-0.173]
</p><p>6 My correspondent suspects that the scale-up estimates are too low and that Hillel’s numbers are too high. [sent-35, score-0.179]
</p><p>7 Numerator incompatible with denominator    As my correspondent writes, “If Unz wants to compare the representation of Jewish students among National Merit Scholar semifinalists to that among Harvard undergrads, he must use the same methodology for both data sets. [sent-39, score-0.254]
</p><p>8 This substantially nullifies Unz’s arguments about Harvard’s admissions preferences for unqualified Jewish students (particularly in comparison to non-Jewish whites, whose enrollment at Harvard he substantially underestimated). [sent-40, score-0.259]
</p><p>9 Typically over 40% of Harvard College students come from New England and the mid-Atlantic, a group of states that includes 48% of American Jews but only 21% of the white population. [sent-46, score-0.185]
</p><p>10 For almost every state, these replicated estimates are higher than the numbers reported by Unz. [sent-56, score-0.185]
</p><p>11 While the Weyl method may produce different results on a state-by-state basis from Unz’s “direct inspection” method, my correspondent found that the Weyl method produced higher Jewish totals than reported by Unz in these states in almost every state checked. [sent-60, score-0.196]
</p><p>12 Unz completely disregards the existence of black and Hispanic high academic achievers, thus obtaining inflated figures for the academic performance of white Gentiles. [sent-79, score-0.163]

</p><p>16 So, for example, the problem with his claim that Jews are being over-admitted to Ivy League colleges is that he uses the Hillel data sets (which are likely over-counts) against his Jewish names method (which likely under-counts). [sent-140, score-0.179]
</p><p>17 Likewise, he includes foreign whites and Asians and others who do not yet have green cards in his Putnam and Harvard Phi Beta Kappa data even though these students were in a separate applicant pool for admissions than were the U. [sent-143, score-0.332]
</p><p>18 In addition, he assumes that all non-Jewish, non-Asian students are non-Jewish US whites, ignoring the fact that some of these students are, in fact, African-American, Hispanic, or, in the case of the Phi Beta Kappa and Putnam data, foreign. [sent-149, score-0.284]
</p><p>19 I read his article as claiming that Jewish students are overrepresented in Harvard’s admissions by roughly a factor of 4 (compared to other whites) compared to their academic achievements and abilities. [sent-155, score-0.345]
</p><p>20 Summary    In his article, Unz claims to have found that elite college admissions underrepresent Asian-Americans (in comparison to their academic talent achievements) and overrepresent Jews, leaving non-Jewish whites squeezed out. [sent-160, score-0.291]

<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.

<p>Introduction: Nurit Baytch posted a document,  A Critique of Ron Unz’s Article “The Myth of American Meritocracy” , that is relevant to an ongoing discussion we had on this blog. Baytch’s article begins:
  
In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show. In addition, Unz’s arguments have proven to be untenable in light of a recent survey of incoming Harvard freshmen conducted by The Harvard Crimson, which found that students who identified as Jewish reported a mean SAT score of 2289</p><p>5 0.62589759 <a title="1720-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-20-Unz_on_Unz.html">1730 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-20-Unz on Unz</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week I  posted skeptical remarks  about Ron Unz’s claim that Harvard admissions discriminate in favor of Jews.  The comment thread was getting long enough there that I thought it most fair to give Unz a chance to present his thoughts here as a new post. I’ve done that before in cases where I’ve disagreed with someone and he wanted to make his views clear.  I will post Unz’s email and my brief response.
 
This is what Unz wrote to me:
  
Since there’s been a great deal of dispute over the numerator and the denominator, it might be useful for each of us should provide our own estimate-range of what we believe are the true figures, and the justification.  Perhaps if our ranges actually overlap substantially, then we don’t really disagree much after all.  I’d think if you’ve been reading most of the endless comments and refreshing your memory about my claims, you’ve probably now developed your own mental model about the likely reality of the values whereas initially you may have simpl</p><p>6 0.50158817 <a title="1720-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-28-Should_Harvard_start_admitting_kids_at_random%3F.html">1595 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-28-Should Harvard start admitting kids at random?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.
  
But these numbers are incorrect, as I learned from a professor of oncology at the Univ</p><p>6 0.84596688 <a title="1720-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-28-Different_modes_of_discourse.html">1743 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-28-Different modes of discourse</a></p>

After seeing the statistics, I don’t see it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.  Some people have sent me some information showing serious problems with Unz’s methods</p><p>2 0.91723144 <a title="1720-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Paul_Rosenbaum_on_those_annoying_pre-treatment_variables_that_are_sort-of_instruments_and_sort-of_covariates.html">287 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Paul Rosenbaum on those annoying pre-treatment variables that are sort-of instruments and sort-of covariates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last year  we discussed  an important challenge in causal inference:  The standard advice (given in many books, including ours) for causal inference is to control for relevant pre-treatment variables as much as possible.  But, as Judea Pearl has pointed out, instruments (as in “instrumental variables”) are pre-treatment variables that we would  not  want to “control for” in a matching or regression sense.
 
At first, this seems like a minor modification, with the new recommendation being to apply instrumental variables estimation using all pre-treatment instruments, and to control for all other pre-treatment variables.  But that can’t really work as general advice.  What about weak instruments or covariates that have some instrumental aspects?
 
I asked Paul Rosenbaum for his thoughts on the matter, and he wrote the following:
  
In section 18.2 of Design of Observational Studies (DOS), I [Rosenbaum] discuss “seemingly innocuous confounding” defined to be a covariate that predicts a su</p><p>3 0.89695257 <a title="1720-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-29-Don%E2%80%99t_try_this_at_home.html">491 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-29-Don’t try this at home</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Malecki’s right,  this  is very cool indeed.
 
 
 
P.S.  Is it really true that “4.5 million Parisians” ride the Metro every day?  Even setting aside that not all the riders are Parisians, I’m guessing that 4.5 million is the number of rides, not the number of people who ride.</p><p>4 0.88291478 <a title="1720-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-22-Ivy_Jew_update.html">2073 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-22-Ivy Jew update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My coblogger John Sides  feeds  a troll.  It’s a tough call.  Yesterday I gave my  reasoning  for ignoring these provocateurs, but in this case the troll in question is writing for a major newspaper so it makes sense for John to go to the trouble of shooting him down.  Even though I suspect the columnist was trolling for no better reason than . . . he had a deadline and nothing to say so he thought he’d wade into a controversy.
 
On the plus side, as a statistician I’m happy that statistics is considered important enough that it’s worth trolling!

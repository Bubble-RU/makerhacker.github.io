 Chapter 1 


On Sunday we were over on 125 St so I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Jesus Taco was next door so I went there instead.  What a mistake!  I don’t know what Masanao and Yu-Sung could’ve been thinking.  Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn’t impress me).  I’m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I’m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn’t tell anyone.  I can’t really figure out why I’m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.  It’s a good deal:  they’re small but not that small.

<p>Introduction: A Brooks op-ed  in the New York Times (circulation approximately 1.5 million):
  
People at the extremes are happier than political moderates. . . . none, it seems, are happier than the Tea Partiers . . .
  
 Jay Livingston  on his blog (circulation approximately 0 (rounding to the nearest million)), giving data from the 2009-2010 General Social Survey, which is the usual place people turn to for population data on happiness of Americans:
  
   


The GSS does not offer “bitter” or “Tea Party” as choices, but extreme conservatives are nearly three times as likely as others to be “not too happy.”
  
Livingston reports that the sample size for “Extremely Conservative” here is 80.  Thus the standard error for that green bar on the right is approx sqrt(0.3*0.7/80)=0.05.
 
So how could Brooks have made such a mistake?  I can think of two possibilities:
 
1.  Brooks has some other data source that directly addresses the happiness of supporters of the Tea Party movement.
 
2.

<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .  (There’s also a side  discussion  about women’s representation in m</p><p>5 0.61648506 <a title="1727-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-22-Ivy_Jew_update.html">2073 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-22-Ivy Jew update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nurit Baytch posted a document,  A Critique of Ron Unz’s Article “The Myth of American Meritocracy” , that is relevant to an ongoing discussion we had on this blog. Baytch’s article begins:
  
In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show. In addition, Unz’s arguments have proven to be untenable in light of a recent survey of incoming Harvard freshmen conducted by The Harvard Crimson, which found that students who identified as Jewish reported a mean SAT score of 2289</p><p>6 0.59367728 <a title="1727-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Janet_Mertz%E2%80%99s_response_to_%E2%80%9CThe_Myth_of_American_Meritocracy%E2%80%9D.html">1751 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Janet Mertz’s response to “The Myth of American Meritocracy”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)


This does not appear to work since it wi</p><p>5 0.74092042 <a title="1727-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-28-Wiley_Wegman_chutzpah_update%3A__Now_you_too_can_buy_a_selection_of_garbled_Wikipedia_articles%2C_for_a_mere_%241400-%242800_per_year%21.html">930 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-28-Wiley Wegman chutzpah update:  Now you too can buy a selection of garbled Wikipedia articles, for a mere $1400-$2800 per year!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone passed on to a message from his university library announcing that the journal “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews:  Computational Statistics” is no longer free.
 
Librarians have to decide what to do, so I thought I’d offer the following consumer guide:

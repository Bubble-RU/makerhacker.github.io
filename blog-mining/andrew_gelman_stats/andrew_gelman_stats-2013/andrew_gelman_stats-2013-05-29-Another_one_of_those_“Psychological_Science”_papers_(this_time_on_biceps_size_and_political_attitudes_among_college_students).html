<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>3 0.18588223 <a title="1876-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?  It depends on the size of the treatment interactions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class.

<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis.

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.

You’ve probably already seen it, but I thought you could have a lot of fun with this one!!
  
 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years. We found no correlation between spouses’ automatic and conscious attitu</p><p>3 0.86816114 <a title="1876-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Controversy_about_average_personality_differences_between_men_and_women.html">1114 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Controversy about average personality differences between men and women</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions.

<p>Introduction: I received a few emails today on bloggable topics.  Rather than expanding each response into a full post, I thought I’d just handle them all quickly. 
   
 1.   Steve Roth asks what I think of  this graph :
  
 
  
I replied:  Interseting but perhaps misleading, as of course any estimate of elasticity of -20 or +5 or whatever is just crap, and so the real question is what is happening in the more reasonable range.
 
 2.   One of my General Social Studies colleagues pointed me to  this report , writing “FYI – some interesting new results, using the linked GSS-NDI data. I trust this study will raise some heated discussions.”  Another colleague wrote, “I’m rather skeptical of the result but at least they spelled GSS right.”
 
The topic is a paper, “Anti-Gay Prejudice and All-Cause Mortality Among Heterosexuals in the United States,” published by Mark Hatzenbuehler, Anna Bellatorre, and Peter Muennig.
 
My reaction:  Yes, it seems ludicrous to me.  Especially this:

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.

<p>Introduction: Michael McLaughlin sent me the following query with the above title.
  
Some time ago, I [McLaughlin] was handed a dataset that needed to be modeled.  It was generated as follows:


1. Random navigation errors, historically a binary mixture of normal and Laplace with a common mean, were collected by observation.


2. Sadly, these data were recorded with too few decimal places so that the resulting quantization is clearly visible in a scatterplot.


3. The quantized data were then interpolated (to an unobserved location).


The final result looks like fuzzy points (small scale jitter) at quantized intervals spanning a much larger scale (the parent mixture distribution).  This fuzziness, likely ~normal or ~Laplace, results from the interpolation.  Otherwise, the data would look like a discrete analogue of the normal/Laplace mixture.


I would like to characterize the latent normal/Laplace mixture distribution but the quantization is “getting in the way”.  When I tried MCMC on this proble</p><p>2 0.973809 <a title="1876-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-What_are_the_standards_for_reliability_in_experimental_psychology%3F.html">1101 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-What are the standards for reliability in experimental psychology?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An experimental psychologist was wondering about the standards in that field for “acceptable reliability” (when looking at inter-rater reliability in coding data).  He wondered, for example, if some variation on signal detectability theory might be applied to adjust for inter-rater differences in criteria for saying some code is present.
 
What about Cohen’s kappa?  The psychologist wrote:
  
Cohen’s kappa does adjust for “guessing,” but its assumptions are not well motivated, perhaps not any more than adjustments for guessing versus the application of signal detectability theory where that can be applied. But one can’t do a straightforward application of signal detectability theory for reliability in that you don’t know whether the signal is present or not.
  
I think measurement issues are important but I don’t have enough experience in this area to answer the question without knowing more about the problem that this researcher is working on.

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>same-blog 4 0.96649432 <a title="1876-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-29-Another_one_of_those_%E2%80%9CPsychological_Science%E2%80%9D_papers_%28this_time_on_biceps_size_and_political_attitudes_among_college_students%29.html">1876 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-29-Another one of those “Psychological Science” papers (this time on biceps size and political attitudes among college students)</a></p>

This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

I’m dealing with high dimensional (40-50 parameters) hierarchical bayesian model applied to nonlinear Poisson regression problem.


Now I’m using an adaptive version for the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm with a truncated drift (Yves F. Atchade, 2003) to obtain samples from posterior.


But this algorithm is not very efficient in my case, it needs several millions iterations as burn-in period. And simulation takes quite a long time, since algorithm has to work with 40×40 matrices.


Maybe you know another MCMC algorithm which could take not so many burn-in samples and would be able to deal with nonlinear regression? In non-hierarchical nonlinear regression model adaptive metropolis algorithm is enough, but in hierarchical case I could use something more effective.

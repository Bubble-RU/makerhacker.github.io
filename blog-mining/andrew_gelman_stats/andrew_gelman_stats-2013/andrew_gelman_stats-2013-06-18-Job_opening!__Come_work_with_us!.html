Microsoft Research NYC [ http://research.microsoft.com/newyork/ ] seeks outstanding applicants for 2-year postdoctoral researcher positions. We welcome applicants with a strong academic record in one of the following areas:


* Computational social science: http://research.microsoft.com/cssnyc 
* Online experimental social science: http://research.microsoft.com/oess_nyc 
* Algorithmic economics and market design: http://research.microsoft.com/algorithmic-economics/ 
* Machine learning: http://research.microsoft.com/mlnyc/


We will also consider applicants in other focus areas of the lab, including information retrieval, and behavioral & empirical economics. Additional information about these areas is included below. Please submit all application materials by January 11, 2013.

<p>Introduction: See below for the job announcement.  It’s for Teachers College, which is about 2 blocks from the statistics department and 2 blocks from the political science department.  So even though I don’t have any official connection with Teachers College (besides occasionally working with them on research projects), I very much would like to have another exciting young applied researcher here, to complement all the people we currently have in stat, poli sci, engineering, etc.  In particular, we have zillions of interesting and important social science research projects going on here, and they all need statistics work.  A lot of social scientists do statistics, but it’s not so easy to find a statistician who does serious social science research.
 
All this is to say that I hope this job gets some applicants from some people who are serious about applied statistics and the development of new models and methods.

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.

We are seeking a highly motivated individual to develop novel statistical methods for missing data imputation and applications in health disparities research using national administrative data, with funding from Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality. The candidate will be jointly mentored by Dr. Yan Ma (PI of the grant) at the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS)/Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and Dr. Andrew Gelman in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. 
   
The candidate will also have excellent opportunities to collaborate with researchers in biostatistics, epidemiology, health disparities, and orthopedics through the Clinical and Translational Science Center at WCMC.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Eric Johnson (Columbia University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on the application of the latest methods of multilevel data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem:  forecasting retail sales at the individual item level.  These forecasts are used to make ordering, pricing and promotions decisions which can have significant economic impact to the retail chain such that even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions, across a large retailerâ&euro;&trade;s product line, can yield substantial margin improvements.
 
Activities focus on the development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.

<p>Introduction: Postdoctoral position in statistical modeling of social networks 
 
A full-time postdoctoral position is available beginning Fall 2014 in the research group of Tian Zheng and Andrew Gelman working on statistical analysis and modeling of social network data, in close cooperation with our experimental collaborators. Four key papers of this project so far are:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/overdisp_final.pdf

http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/DiPreteetal.pdf
 
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2473.pdf
 
Requirements: The work is highly interdisciplinary, and applicants must have strong statistical and computational skills.  Social science research skills are preferred but not necessary. Preferred educational background is a PhD in statistics, computer science, political science, sociology, or a related field. Expertise in Bayesian modeling and computing is required.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>3 0.95798934 <a title="1904-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc_positions_at_Microsoft_Research_%E2%80%93_NYC.html">1630 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc positions at Microsoft Research – NYC</a></p>

I’m trying to generate county-level estimates from a statewide survey of California using multilevel modeling.  I would love to learn the full Bayesian approach, but I’m on a tight schedule and worried about teaching myself something of that complexity in the time available.


I’m hoping I can use the classical approach and simulate standard errors using what you and Jennifer Hill call the “informal Bayesian” method.  This has raised a few questions:


First, what are the costs of using this approach as opposed to full Bayesian?


Second, when I use the predictive simulation as described on p. 149 of “Data Analysis” on a binary dependent variable and a sample of 2000, I get a 5%-95% range of simulation results so large as to be effectively useless (on the order of +/- 15 points).  This is true even for LA county, which has enough cases by itself (about 500) to get a standard error of about 2 points from simple disaggregation.  However, if I simulate only with t</p><p>5 0.94892436 <a title="1904-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-29-Postdocs_in_probabilistic_modeling%21__With_David_Blei%21__And_Stan%21.html">1961 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-29-Postdocs in probabilistic modeling!

I have  two postdoc openings for basic research in probabilistic modeling .


The thrusts are (a) scalable inference and (b) model checking.  We 
will be developing new methods and implementing them in probabilistic 
programming systems.  I am open to applicants interested in many kinds 
of applications and from any field.
  
“Scalable inference” means black-box VB and related ideas, and “probabilistic programming systems” means Stan!  (You might be familiar with Stan as an implementation of Nuts for posterior sampling, but Stan is also an efficient program for computing probability densities and their gradients, and as such is an ideal platform for developing scalable implementations of variational inference and related algorithms.)
 
And you know I like model checking.

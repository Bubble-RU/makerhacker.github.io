</p><p>6 The reason I bring it up is that software development almost inevitably employs the  Shlemiel the Painter algorithm . [sent-19, score-0.354]
</p><p>7 Here’s the problem in a nutshell:   The more moving pieces your software has, the longer it takes to add a new feature or change an existing feature. [sent-20, score-0.684]

Here are the highlights.
  Full Mass Matrix Estimation during Warmup  
Yuanjun Gao, a first-year grad student here at Columbia (!), built a regularized mass-matrix estimator.   This helps for posteriors with high correlation among parameters and varying scales.  We’re still testing this ourselves, so the estimation procedure may change in the future (don’t worry — it satisfies detailed balance as is, but we might be able to make it more computationally efficient in terms of time per effective sample).
 
It’s not the default option.  The major reason is the matrix operations required are expensive, raising the algorithm cost to    , where   is the average number of leapfrog steps,   is the number of iterations, and   is the number of parameters.
 
Yuanjun did a great job with the Cholesky factorizations and implemented this about as efficiently as is possible.

I’ve been happily using R for a number of years now and recently came across Stan. Looks big and powerful, so I’d like to pick an appropriate project and try it out. I wondered if you could point me to a link or document that goes into the motivation for this tool (aside from the Stan user doc)?  What I’d like to understand is, at what point might you look at an emergent R project and advise, “You know, that thing you’re trying to do would be a whole lot easier/simpler/more straightforward to implement with Stan.” (or words to that effect).
  
My reply:  For my collaborators in political science, Stan has been most useful for models where the data set is not huge (e.g., we might have 10,000 data points or 50,000 data points but not 10 million) but where the model is somewhat complex (for example, a model with latent time series structure).

<p>Introduction: Some thoughts from Christian , including this bit:
  
We need to consider separately


1. R’s brilliant library


2. R’s not-so-brilliant language and/or interpreter.
  
I don’t know that R’s library is so brilliant as all that–if necessary, I don’t think it would be hard to reprogram the important packages in a new language.
 
I would say, though, that the problems with R are not just in the technical details of the language.  I think the culture of R has some problems too.  As I’ve written before, R functions used to be lean and mean, and now they’re full of exception-handling and calls to other packages.  R functions are spaghetti-like messes of connections in which I keep expecting to run into syntax like “GOTO 120.”
 
I learned about these problems a couple years ago when writing bayesglm(), which is a simple adaptation of glm().  But glm(), and its workhorse, glm.fit(), are a mess:  They’re about 10 lines of functioning code, plus about 20 lines of necessary front-end, plus a cou</p><p>3 0.78395689 <a title="2089-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-24-Bleg%3A_Automatic_Differentiation_for_Log_Prob_Gradients%3F.html">535 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-24-Bleg: Automatic Differentiation for Log Prob Gradients?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need help picking out an automatic differentiation package for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior of a  generalized linear model with deep interactions.  Specifically, we need to compute gradients for log probability functions with thousands of parameters that involve matrix (determinants, eigenvalues, inverses), stats (distributions), and math (log gamma) functions.  Any suggestions?
    
 The Application: Hybrid Monte Carlo for Posteriors 
 
We’re getting serious about implementing posterior sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC speeds up mixing by including gradient information to help guide the Metropolis proposals toward areas  high probability.  In practice, the algorithm requires a handful or  of gradient calculations per sample, but there are many dimensions and the functions are hairy enough we don’t want to compute derivaties by hand.

<p>Introduction: Andrew and I have been discussing how we’re going to define functions in Stan for defining systems of differential equations;  see our evolving  ode design doc ;  comments welcome, of course.
 
 About Scope 
 
I mentioned to Andrew I would prefer pure lexical, static scoping, as found in languages like C++ and Java.  If you’re not familiar with the alternatives, there’s a nice overview in the  Wikipedia article on scope .  Let me call out a few passages that will help set the context.
  

A fundamental distinction in scoping is what “context” means – whether name resolution depends on the location in the source code (lexical scope, static scope, which depends on the lexical context) or depends on the program state when the name is encountered (dynamic scope, which depends on the execution context or calling context). Lexical resolution can be determined at compile time, and is also known as early binding, while dynamic resolution can in general only be determined at run time, and thus</p><p>5 0.77731246 <a title="2089-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-09-iPython_Notebook.html">1716 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-09-iPython Notebook</a></p>

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.

<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9534086 <a title="2089-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-04-Shlemiel_the_Software_Developer_and_Unknown_Unknowns.html">2089 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-04-Shlemiel the Software Developer and Unknown Unknowns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Stan meeting today reminded me of Joel Spolsky’s recasting of the Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the Painter. Joel retold it on his blog,  Joel on Software , in the post  Back to Basics :
  

Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”


“I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”

<p>Introduction: Alexis Le Nestour writes:
  
How do you test for no effect? I attended a seminar where the person assumed that a non significant difference between groups implied an absence of effect. In that case, the researcher needed to show that two groups were similar before being hit by a shock conditional on some observable variables. The assumption was that the two groups were similar and that the shock was random. What would be the good way to set up a test in that case?


I know you’ve been through that before (http://andrewgelman.com/2009/02/not_statistical/) and there are interesting comments but I wanted to have your opinion on that.
  
My reply:  I think you have to get quantitative here.  How similar is similar?  Don’t let your standard errors drive your research agenda.  Or, to put it another way, what would you do if you had all the data?  If your sample size were 1 zillion, then everything would statistically distinguishable from everything else.

<p>Introduction: I remember in 4th grade or so, the teacher would give us a list of vocabulary words each week and we’d have to show we learned them by using each in a sentence.  We quickly got bored and decided to do the assignment by writing a single sentence using all ten words.  (Which the teacher hated, of course.)
 
The above headline is in that spirit, combining  blog   posts  rather than vocabulary words.
 
But that only uses two of the entries.  To really do the job, I’d need to throw in bivariate associations, ecological fallacies, high-dimensional feature selection, statistical significance, the suddenly unpopular name Hilary, snotty reviewers, the contagion of obesity, and milk-related spam.
 
Or we could bring in some of the all-time favorites, such as Bayesians, economists, Finland, beautiful parents and their daughters, goofy graphics, red and blue states, essentialism in children’s reasoning, chess running, and zombies.

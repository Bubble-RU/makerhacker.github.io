<p>Introduction: A student writes:
  
I have a question about an earlier recommendation of yours on the election of the prior distribution for the precision hyperparameter of a normal distribution, and a reference for the recommendation. If I recall correctly I have read that you have suggested to use Gamma(1.4, 0.4) instead of Gamma(0.01,0.01) for the prior distribution of the precision hyper parameter of a normal distribution.


I would very much appreciate if you would have the time to point me to this publication of yours. The reason is that I have used the prior distribution (Gamma(1.4, 0.4)) in a study which we now revise for publication, and where a reviewer question the choice of the distribution (claiming that it is too informative!).


I am well aware of that you in recent publications (Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models.

I shouldn’t mock when it comes to mathematics–after all, I proved a false theorem once!  (Or, to be precise, my collaborator and I published a false claim which we thought we’d proved, thus we thought was a theorem.)
 
So let me retract the mockery and move, first to the mathematics and then to the statistics.
  

 
First, how many possibilities are there in pick 6 out of 45?  It’s (45*44*43*42*41*40)/6! = 8,145,060.  Let’s call this number N.
 
Second, what’s the probability that the same numbers repeat in a single calendar month?  I’ve been told that the Israeli lottery has 2 draws per week,  That’s 104/12=8.67 draws per month.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>3 0.74149913 <a title="1897-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-Lottery_probability_update.html">731 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-Lottery probability update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Every time I hear  this  sort of story:
  
Morrone—listed at 48 years old, which would have made her the oldest Olympic cross-country skier of all time by seven years—didn’t even show up for the 10K women’s classic on Feb. 13, claiming injury. (She was the only one of the race’s 76 entrants who didn’t start.) A day later, in the 15K men’s classic, di Silvestri, 47, made it out of the starting gate but gave up just a few hundred meters later, claiming illness. He was reportedly the only starter who failed to make even the first checkpoint.
  
I think about my cousin  Bill .
 
At least when Bill skied in the winter olympics a bunch of years ago as part of the Puerto Rican team, he finished.  OK, he finished last, but  somebody  had to finish last.  At least he skied down the whole damn slope.
 
P.S.  I have no idea how Puerto Rico was allowed to have an olympic team.  As you might have heard, it’s not actually a country.

<p>Introduction: Biostatistician Jeff Leek  writes :
  
Think about this headline: “Hospital checklist cut infections, saved lives.” I [Leek] am a pretty skeptical person, so I’m a little surprised that a checklist could really save lives. I say the odds of this being true are 1 in 4.
  
I’m actually surprised that he’s surprised, since over the years I’ve heard about the benefits of checklists in various arenas, including hospital care.  In particular, there was  this article  by Atul Gawande from a few years back.  I mean, sure, I could imagine that checklists might hurt:  after all, it takes some time and effort to put together the checklist and to use it, and perhaps the very existence of the checklist could give hospital staff a false feeling of security, which would ultimately cost lives.  But my first guess would be that people still don’t do enough checklisting, and that the probability is greater than 1/4 that a checklist in a hospital will save lives.

<p>Introduction: Stephanie Evergreen writes:
  
 
Media, web design, and marketing have all created an environment where stakeholders – clients, program participants, funders – all expect high quality graphics and reporting that effectively conveys the valuable insights from evaluation work. Some in statistics and mathematics have used data visualization strategies to support more useful reporting of complex ideas. Global growing interest in improving communications has begun to take root in the evaluation field as well. But as anyone who has sat through a day’s worth of a conference or had to endure a dissertation-worthy evaluation report knows, evaluators still have a long way to go. To support the development of researchers and evaluators, some members of the American Evaluation Association are proposing a new TIG (Topical Interest Group) on Data Visualization and Reporting.  If you are a member of AEA (or want to be) and you are interested in joining this TIG,  contact  Stephanie Evergreen.</p><p>2 0.95271289 <a title="1897-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>4 0.93878734 <a title="1897-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>5 0.93401819 <a title="1897-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-11-My_talk_at_the_NY_data_visualization_meetup_this_Monday%21.html">1668 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-11-My talk at the NY data visualization meetup this Monday!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s in midtown at 7pm  (on Mon 14 Jan 2013).
 
Last time I talked for this group, I spoke on  Infovis vs. Statistical Graphics .  This time I plan to just go thru the choices involved in a few zillion graphs I’ve published over the years, to give a sense of the options and choices involved in graphical communication. For this talk there will be no single theme (except, perhaps, my usual “Graphs as comparisons,” “All of statistics as comparisons,” and “Exploratory data analysis as hypothesis testing”), just a bunch of open discussion about what I tried, why I tried it, what worked and what didn’t work, etc. I’ve discussed these sorts of decisions on occasion (and am now writing a paper with Yair about some of this for our voting models), but I’ve never tried to make a talk out of it before. Could be fun.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.93357086 <a title="1897-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-13-When%E2%80%99s_that_next_gamma-ray_blast_gonna_come%2C_already%3F.html">1897 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-13-When’s that next gamma-ray blast gonna come, already?</a></p>

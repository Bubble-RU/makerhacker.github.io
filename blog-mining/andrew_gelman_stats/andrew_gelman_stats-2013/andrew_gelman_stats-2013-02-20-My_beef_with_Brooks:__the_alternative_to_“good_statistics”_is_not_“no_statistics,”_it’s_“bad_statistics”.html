</p><p>9 The funny thing is, yesterday’s column would’ve been the perfect place for Brooks to make his correction. [sent-26, score-0.128]

</p><p>12 My point is that, if Brooks wants to talk about the limitations of data, he could start with himself. [sent-36, score-0.115]
</p><p>13 To put it another way, if Brooks wants to claim, of American Jews, that “the fanatical generations of immigrant strivers have been replaced by a more comfortable generation of preprofessionals,” then, hey, go for it. [sent-39, score-0.145]

<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.

After seeing the statistics, I don’t see it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.

<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

<p>Introduction: Nurit Baytch posted a document,  A Critique of Ron Unz’s Article “The Myth of American Meritocracy” , that is relevant to an ongoing discussion we had on this blog. Baytch’s article begins:
  
In “The Myth of American Meritocracy,” Ron Unz, the publisher of The American Conservative, claimed that Harvard discriminates against non-Jewish white and Asian students in favor of Jewish students. I [Baytch] shall demonstrate that Unz’s conclusion that Jews are over-admitted to Harvard was erroneous, as he relied on faulty assumptions and spurious data: Unz substantially overestimated the percentage of Jews at Harvard while grossly underestimating the percentage of Jews among high academic achievers, when, in fact, there is no discrepancy, as my analysis will show. In addition, Unz’s arguments have proven to be untenable in light of a recent survey of incoming Harvard freshmen conducted by The Harvard Crimson, which found that students who identified as Jewish reported a mean SAT score of 2289</p><p>4 0.9320522 <a title="1729-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-18-Mertz%E2%80%99s_reply_to_Unz%E2%80%99s_response_to_Mertz%E2%80%99s_comments_on_Unz%E2%80%99s_article.html">1768 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-18-Mertz’s reply to Unz’s response to Mertz’s comments on Unz’s article</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

After seeing the statistics, I don’t see it.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago  we discussed  Ron Unz’s claim that Jews are massively overrepresented in Ivy League college admissions, not just in comparison to the general population of college-age Americans, but even in comparison to other white kids with comparable academic ability and preparation.
 
Most of Unz’s article concerns admissions of Asian-Americans, and he also has a proposal to admit certain students at random (see my discussion in the link above).  In the present post, I concentrate on the statistics about Jewish students, because this is where I have learned that his statistics are particularly suspect, with various numbers being off by factors of 2 or 4 or more.
 
Unz’s  article  was discussed, largely favorably, by academic bloggers  Tyler Cowen ,  Steve Hsu , and . . . me!  Hsu writes:  “Don’t miss the statistical supplement.”  But a lot of our trust in those statistics seems to be misplaced.

<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.
  
But these numbers are incorrect, as I learned from a professor of oncology at the Univ</p><p>2 0.94048679 <a title="1729-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . .

<p>Introduction: My article with Cosma Shalizi has appeared in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.  I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.
 
 Here’s the issue of the journal , which also includes an introduction, several discussions, and a rejoinder:

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein asks for my thoughts as  a Bayesian on the above topic.  So here they are (briefly):
 
The concept of the bias-variance tradeoff can be useful if you don’t take it too seriously.  The basic idea is as follows:  if you’re estimating something, you can slice your data finer and finer, or perform more and more adjustments, each time getting a purer—and less biased—estimate.  But each subdivision or each adjustment reduces your sample size or increases potential estimation error, hence the variance of your estimate goes up.
 
That story is real.  In lots and lots of examples, there’s a continuum between a completely unadjusted general estimate (high bias, low variance) and a specific, focused, adjusted estimate (low bias, high variance).
 
Suppose, for example, you’re using data from a large experiment to estimate the effect of a treatment on a fairly narrow group, say, white men between the ages of 45 and 50.  At one extreme, you could just take the estimated treatment e</p><p>5 0.93208981 <a title="1729-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Popular_governor%2C_small_state.html">159 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Popular governor, small state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, upon the selection of Sarah Palin as vice-presidential nominee, I made some graphs of the popularity of governors of different-sized states:
 
 
 
As I wrote  at the time :
 
It seems to be easier to maintain high approval in a small state. What’s going on? Some theories: in a large state, there will be more ambitious politicians on the other side, eager to knock off the incumbent governor; small states often have part-time legislatures and thus the governor is involved in less political conflict; small states (notably Alaska) tend to get more funds per capita from the federal government, and it’s easier to be popular when you can disburse more funds; large states tend to be more heterogeneous and so it’s harder to keep all the voters happy.
 
I was curious how things have been going more recently, and Hanfei made an updated graph using data from  this archive .  Here’s the story:

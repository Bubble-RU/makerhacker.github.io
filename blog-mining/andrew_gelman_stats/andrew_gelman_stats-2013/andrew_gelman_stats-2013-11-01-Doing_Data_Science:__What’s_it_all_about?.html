</p><p>10 But privacy takes lives too, as we see from this story of emergency room deaths. [sent-47, score-0.346]
</p><p>11 Here’s Wikipedia:  “A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. [sent-53, score-0.522]

</p><p>15 If the town had 20,000 people (which would seem to be near the upper limit of the population of a town that one would call “smallish,” at least in the United States), then we’re talking 1/4 of the deaths, which still seems way too large a proportion. [sent-72, score-1.331]
</p><p>16 Even if it is a town with lots of old people, so that much more than 1/70 of the population is dropping off each year, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. [sent-73, score-0.698]

</p><p>18 But, 75 excess deaths a year caused by “lack of information flow” still seems like a lot, and if the patients are drawn from a  large population, it seems a bit misleading to describe these deaths as being “in a certain smallish town. [sent-75, score-0.855]
</p><p>19 From a statistical perspective, we want to know the data-generation process (also called the likelihood function, also called “where did the data come from”) as well as the numerical data (or, in this case, the story, or anecdote, or parable, itself). [sent-82, score-0.407]

<p>Introduction: God is in every leaf of every tree , but he is not in every leaf of every parable.
 
Let me explain with a story.  A few months ago I  read  the new book, Doing Data Science, by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neal, and I came across the following motivation for comprehensive integration of data sources, a story that is reminiscent of the parables we sometimes see in business books:
  
By some estimates, one or two patients died per week in a certain smallish town because of the lack of information flow between the hospital’s emergency room and the nearby mental health clinic. In other words, if the records had been easier to match, they’d have been able to save more lives. On the other hand, if it had been easy to match records, other breaches of confidence might also have occurred. Of course it’s hard to know exactly how many lives are at stake, but it’s nontrivial.

<p>Introduction: After reading Rachel and Cathy’s  book , I  wrote  that “Statistics is the least important part of data science . . . I think it would be fair to consider statistics as a subset of data science. . . . it’s not the most important part of data science, or even close.”
 
But then I received “Data Science for Business,” by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett, in the mail.  I might not have opened the book at all (as I’m hardly in the target audience) but for seeing a blurb by Chris Volinsky, a statistician whom I respect a lot.
 
So I flipped through the book and it indeed looked pretty good.  It moves slowly but that’s appropriate for an intro book.  But what surprised me, given the book’s title and our recent discussion on the nature of data science, was that the book was 100% statistics!   It had some math (for example, definitions of various distance measures), some simple algebra, some conceptual graphs such as ROC curve, some tables and graphs of low-dimensional data summaries—but almost</p><p>4 0.19990121 <a title="2084-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-09-President_Carter.html">195 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-09-President Carter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This assessment  by Tyler Cowen reminded me that, in 1980, I and just about all my friends hated Jimmy Carter.  Most of us much preferred him to Reagan but still hated Carter.  I wouldn’t associate this with any particular ideological feeling—it’s not that we thought he was too liberal, or too conservative.  He just seemed completely ineffectual.  I remember feeling at the time that he had no principles, that he’d do anything to get elected.
 
In retrospect, I think of this as an instance of uniform partisan swing:  the president was unpopular nationally, and attitudes about him were negative, relatively speaking, among just about every group.
 
My other Carter story comes from a conversation I had a couple years ago with an economist who’s about my age, a man who said that one reason he and his family moved from town A to town B in his metropolitan area was that, in town B, they didn’t feel like they were the only Republicans on their block.
 
Anyway, this guy described himself as a “</p><p>5 0.15347205 <a title="2084-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-01-%E2%80%9COn_Inspiring_Students_and_Being_Human%E2%80%9D.html">1517 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-01-“On Inspiring Students and Being Human”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:

I [Lightburn] am also a member of the group Business  Analytics  on LinkedIn.  I am struck by what I perceive as the gross misuse of statistics by the members of this group, including things that (I thought) were taught in Introductory Statistics courses in business schools.  I want to suggest to you that you look at the discussions there if you want examples of such abuse.


The discussions there support me in my belief that Analytics is data manipulation in the support of previously developed conclusions.
  
My reply:  I don’t think it’s such a bad thing.  I like when people make statistical arguments, even bad statistical arguments.

<p>Introduction: With all this data floating around, there are some interesting analyses one can do. I came across  “The Association of Tree Pollen Concentration Peaks and Allergy Medication Sales in New York City: 2003-2008″  by  Perry Sheffield . There they correlate pollen counts with anti-allergy medicine sales – and indeed find that two days after high pollen counts, the medicine sales are the highest.
 
 
 
Of course, it would be interesting to play with the data to see *what* tree is actually causing the sales to increase the most. Perhaps this would help the arborists what trees to plant. At the moment they seem to be following  a rather sexist approach  to tree planting:
  

Ogren says the city could solve the problem by planting only female trees, which don’t produce pollen like male trees do.


City arborists shy away from females because many produce messy – or in the case of ginkgos, smelly – fruit that litters sidewalks.


In Ogren’s opinion, that’s a mistake. He says the females only pro</p><p>5 0.78883034 <a title="2084-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-01-Peter_Huber%E2%80%99s_reflections_on_data_analysis.html">690 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-01-Peter Huber’s reflections on data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Huber’s most famous work derives from  his paper  on robust statistics published nearly fifty years ago in which he introduced the concept of M-estimation (a generalization of maximum likelihood) to unify some ideas of Tukey and others for estimation procedures that were relatively insensitive to small departures from the assumed model.
 
Huber has in many ways been ahead of his time.  While remaining connected to the theoretical ideas from the early part of his career, his interests have shifted to computational and graphical statistics.  I never took Huber’s class on data analysis–he left Harvard while I was still in graduate school–but fortunately I have an opportunity to learn his lessons now, as he has just released a book, “Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years.”
 
The book puts together a few articles published in the past 15 years, along with some new material.  Many of the examples are decades old, which is appropriate given that Huber is reviewing f</p><p>6 0.78519303 <a title="2084-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-24-An_interesting_mosaic_of_a_data_programming_course.html">2345 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-24-An interesting mosaic of a data programming course</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After reading Rachel and Cathy’s  book , I  wrote  that “Statistics is the least important part of data science . . . I think it would be fair to consider statistics as a subset of data science. . . . it’s not the most important part of data science, or even close.”
 
But then I received “Data Science for Business,” by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett, in the mail.  I might not have opened the book at all (as I’m hardly in the target audience) but for seeing a blurb by Chris Volinsky, a statistician whom I respect a lot.
 
So I flipped through the book and it indeed looked pretty good.  It moves slowly but that’s appropriate for an intro book.  But what surprised me, given the book’s title and our recent discussion on the nature of data science, was that the book was 100% statistics!   It had some math (for example, definitions of various distance measures), some simple algebra, some conceptual graphs such as ROC curve, some tables and graphs of low-dimensional data summaries—but almost</p><p>2 0.97605234 <a title="2084-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-20-Why_no_Wegmania%3F.html">722 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-20-Why no Wegmania?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague asks:
  
When I search the web, I find  the story  [of the article by Said, Wegman, et al. on social networks in climate research, which was recently bumped from the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis because of plagiarism] only on blogs, USA Today, and UPI.  Why is that?  Any idea why it isn’t reported by any of the major newspapers?
  
Here’s my answer:
 
1.  USA Today broke the story.  Apparently this USA Today reporter put a lot of effort into it.  The NYT doesn’t like to run a story that begins, “Yesterday, USA Today reported…”
 
2.  To us it’s big news because we’re statisticians.  [The main guy in the study, Edward Wegman, won the Founders Award from the American Statistical Association a few years ago.]  To the rest of the world, the story is:  “Obscure prof at an obscure college plagiarized an article in a journal that nobody’s ever heard of.”  When a Harvard scientist paints black dots on white mice and says he’s curing cancer, that’s news.

I was wondering if you could help me with some code to set up a posterior predictive check for an unordered multinomial multilevel model.  In this case the outcome is categories of bmi (underweight, nomral weight, and overweight) based on individuals from 360 different areas. What I would like to do is set up a replicated dataset  to see how the number of overweight/underweight/normal weight individuals based on the model compares to the actual data and some kind of a graphical summary. I am following along with chapter 24 of the arm book but I want to verify that the replicated data accounts for the multilevel structure of the data of people within areas. I am attaching the code I used to run a simple model with only 2 predictors (area wealth and urban/rural designation).
  
My reply:  The Bugs code is a bit much for me to look at–but I do recommend that you run it from R, which will give you more flexibility in preprocessing and postprocessing the data.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.
 
The question then arises:  why do descriptions of data science focus so</p><p>5 0.96985239 <a title="2084-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-03-As_the_boldest_experiment_in_journalism_history%2C_you_admit_you_made_a_mistake.html">2280 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-03-As the boldest experiment in journalism history, you admit you made a mistake</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The pre-NYT David Brooks liked to make fun of the NYT.  Here’s one  from 1997 :
  
I’m not sure I’d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I’d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.


And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man—Thomas Arena—who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .


These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan’s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.

<p>Introduction: Chris Paulse points me to  this book  by Ruth Grant:
  
Incentives can be found everywhere–in schools, businesses, factories, and government–influencing people’s choices about almost everything, from financial decisions and tobacco use to exercise and child rearing. So long as people have a choice, incentives seem innocuous. But Strings Attached demonstrates that when incentives are viewed as a kind of power rather than as a form of exchange, many ethical questions arise: How do incentives affect character and institutional culture? Can incentives be manipulative or exploitative, even if people are free to refuse them? What are the responsibilities of the powerful in using incentives? Ruth Grant shows that, like all other forms of power, incentives can be subject to abuse, and she identifies their legitimate and illegitimate uses.


Grant offers a history of the growth of incentives in early twentieth-century America, identifies standards for judging incentives, and examines incentives</p><p>4 0.10763142 <a title="1694-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-06-Ideas_that_spread_fast_and_slow.html">2053 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-06-Ideas that spread fast and slow</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Atul Gawande (the thinking man’s Malcolm Gladwell)  asks :
  
Why do some innovations spread so swiftly and others so slowly? Consider the very different trajectories of surgical anesthesia and antiseptics, both of which were discovered in the nineteenth century. The first public demonstration of anesthesia was in 1846. The Boston surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow was approached by a local dentist named William Morton, who insisted that he had found a gas that could render patients insensible to the pain of surgery. That was a dramatic claim. In those days, even a minor tooth extraction was excruciating. Without effective pain control, surgeons learned to work with slashing speed. Attendants pinned patients down as they screamed and thrashed, until they fainted from the agony. Nothing ever tried had made much difference. Nonetheless, Bigelow agreed to let Morton demonstrate his claim.


On October 16, 1846, at Massachusetts General Hospital, Morton administered his gas through an inhaler in</p><p>5 0.096988089 <a title="1694-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-23-New_blog_home.html">817 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-23-New blog home</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jed Dougherty points me to  this opinion piece  by Jacqueline Stevens, a professor of art at Northwestern University, who writes:
  
Artists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts.  Colleagues, especially those who have received N.E.A. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I’m sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government — disproportionately — supports art that I do not like.


Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!


It’s an open secret in my</p><p>3 0.72672057 <a title="1694-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-29-Why_%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1190 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-29-Why “Why”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In old books (and occasionally new books), you see the word “Why” used to indicate a pause or emphasis in dialogue.
 
For example, from 1952:
  
“Why, how perfectly simple!” she said to herself.  “The way to save Wilbur’s life is to play a trick on Zuckerman.  “If I can fool a bug,” thought Charlotte, “I can surely fool a man.  People are not as smart as bugs.”
  
That line about people and bugs was cute, but what really jumped out at me was the “Why.”  I don’t think I’ve ever ever heard anyone use “Why” in that way in conversation, but I see it all the time in books, and every time it’s jarring.
 
What’s the deal?  Is it that people used to talk that way?  Or is a Wasp thing, some regional speech pattern that was captured in books because it was considered standard conversational speech?  I suppose one way to learn more would be to watch a bunch of old movies.  I could sort of imagine Jimmy Stewart beginning his sentences with “Why” all the time.
 
Does anyone know more?

<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  writes :
  
I know that in art, quality and value are two very different things.  Still, I had to stop and wonder when I read about

 
Domenico and Eleanore De Sole, who in 2004 paid $8.3 million for a painting attributed to Mark Rothko that they now say is a worthless fake.
 

One day a painting is worth $8.3 million; the next day, the same painting – same quality, same capacity to give aesthetic pleasure or do whatever it is that art does – is “worthless.”*  Art forgery also makes me wonder about the buyer’s motive.  If the buyer wanted only to have and to gaze upon something beautiful, something with artistic merit, then a fake Rothko is no different than a real Rothko.  It seems more likely that what the buyer wants is to own something valuable – i.e., something that costs a lot. Displaying your brokerage account statements is just too crude and obvious.  What the high-end art market offers is a kind of money laundering. Objects that are rare and therefore expensive</p><p>5 0.71448153 <a title="1694-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-04-Peabody_here..html">2197 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-04-Peabody here.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I saw the trailer for the new Mr. Peabody movie and it looked terrible.  They used that weird animation where everything looks round, also the voice had none of the intonations of the “real” Peabody (for some reason, the trailer had the original English voices, maybe they didn’t get their act together to make a dubbed trailer in time for the release here), also the scenes looked pretty stupid.  I went back home and checked out Peabody on wikipedia and it turns out that they made 91 episodes!  I had no idea.
 
Anyway, here’s my real question:  Why bother making a Mr. Peabody movie if you’re not going to do it well?  I understand that lots of moviemakers are hacks and there will always be a huge audience for crap in any case, so I’m certainly not demanding that all movies be “good” (in whatever sense that means, from my perceptions).  But there are lots and lots of opportunities to make crap movies, there are a million toys and video games and comic book characters and fairy tales and br</p><p>6 0.70836514 <a title="1694-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-19-Online_James%3F.html">620 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-19-Online James?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have to say, it distorts my internal incentives when I am happy to see really blatant examples of ethical lapses.  Sort of like when you’re cleaning the attic and searching for roaches:  on one hand, you’d be happy if there were none, but, still, there’s a thrill each time you find a roach and catch it—and, at that point, you want it to be a big ugly one!</p><p>4 0.71294039 <a title="1694-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Faculty_Position_in_Visualization%2C_Visual_Analytics%2C_Imaging%2C_and_Human_Centered_Computing.html">1651 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Faculty Position in Visualization, Visual Analytics, Imaging, and Human Centered Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Ebert sends this along:
  
Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>5 0.68514419 <a title="1694-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-Three_hours_in_the_life_of_a_statistician.html">1001 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-Three hours in the life of a statistician</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung tells  what it’s really like .
 
Here’s a sample:
  
As soon as I [Kaiser] put the substring-concatenate expression together with two lines of code that generate data tables, it choked.
  
Sorta like Dashiell Hammett without the broads and the heaters.
 
And  here’s  another take, from a slightly different perspective.</p><p>6 0.6109255 <a title="1694-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-07-Chi-square_FAIL_when_many_cells_have_small_expected_values.html">996 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-07-Chi-square FAIL when many cells have small expected values</a></p>

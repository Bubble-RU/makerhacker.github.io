Is it fair to quote the definition of economics from the blurb for a book?  If so, consider this definition in the blurb for Emily Oster’s new book:

 
When Oster was expecting her first child, she felt powerless to make the right decisions for her pregnancy. How doctors think and what patients need are two very different things. So Oster drew on her own experience and went in search of the real facts about pregnancy using an economist’s tools. Economics is not just a study of finance. It’s the science of determining value and making informed decisions. To make a good decision, you need to understand the information available to you and to know what it means to you as an individual.

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>4 0.12194449 <a title="1696-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-08-The_politics_of_economic_and_statistical_models.html">1204 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-08-The politics of economic and statistical models</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi writes the above in a  discussion  of a misunderstanding of the economics of Keynes.
 
The discussion is interesting.  According to Sethi, Keynes wrote that, in a depression, nominal wages might be sticky but in any case a decline in wages would not do the trick to increase hiring.  But many modern economics writers have missed this. For example, Gary Becker writes, “Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in the downward direction. . . . A fall in price stimulates demand and reduces supply until they are brought back to rough equality.”  Whether Becker is empirically correct is another story, but in any case he is misinterpreting Keynes.
 
But the actual reason I’m posting here is in reaction to Sethi’s remark quoted in the title above, in which he endorses a 1975 paper by James Tobin on wages and employment but remarks that Tobin’s paper did not include the individual-level de</p><p>6 0.11524131 <a title="1696-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-12-Crime_novels_for_economists.html">1852 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-12-Crime novels for economists</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>5 0.79414487 <a title="1696-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-14-Steven_Rhoads%E2%80%99s_book%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_Economist%E2%80%99s_View_of_the_World%E2%80%9D.html">711 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-14-Steven Rhoads’s book, “The Economist’s View of the World”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 15 years ago I ran across this book and read it, just for fun.  Rhoads is a (nonquantitative) political scientist and he’s writing about basic economic concepts such as opportunity cost, marginalism, and economic incentives.  As he puts it, “welfare economics is concerned with anything any individual values enough to be willing to give something up for it.”
 
The first two-thirds of the book is all about the “economist’s view” (personally, I’d prefer to see it called the “quantitative view”) of the world and how it applies to policy issues.  The quick message, which I think is more generally accepted now than in the 1970s when Rhoads started working on this book, is that free-market processes can do better than governmental rules in allocating resources.  Certain ideas that are obvious to quantitative people–for example, we want to reduce pollution and reduce the incentives to pollute, but it does not make sense to try to get the level of a pollutant all the way down to zero if t</p><p>6 0.79206264 <a title="1696-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-19-%E2%80%9COne_of_the_easiest_ways_to_differentiate_an_economist_from_almost_anyone_else_in_society%E2%80%9D.html">809 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-19-“One of the easiest ways to differentiate an economist from almost anyone else in society”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.

Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers   


Virgil Gligor Carnegie Mellon University 


We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scams/deception. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced</p><p>6 0.92878878 <a title="1696-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-26-Milo_and_Milo.html">824 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-26-Milo and Milo</a></p>

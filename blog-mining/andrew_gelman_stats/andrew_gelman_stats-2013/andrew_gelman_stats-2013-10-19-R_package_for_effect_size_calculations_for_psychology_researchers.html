You and your blog readers may be interested to know that a we’ve released a major new version of the BayesFactor package to CRAN. The package computes Bayes factors for linear mixed models and regression models. Of course, I’m aware you don’t like point-null model comparisons, but the package does more than that; it also allows sampling from posterior distributions of the compared models, in much the same way that your arm package does with lmer objects. The sampling (both for the Bayes factors and posteriors) is quite fast, since the back end is written in C.


Some basic examples using the package can be found  here , and the CRAN page is  here .
  
Indeed I don’t like point-null model comparisons . . . but maybe this will be useful to some of you!</p><p>3 0.1741378 <a title="2069-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-21-Lessons_learned_from_a_recent_R_package_submission.html">1134 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-21-Lessons learned from a recent R package submission</a></p>
<p>Introduction: R has zillions of packages, and people are submitting  new ones each day .  The volunteers who keep R going are doing an incredibly useful service to the profession, and they’re  busy .
 
   
 
A colleague sends in some suugestions based on a recent experience with a package update:
  
 1. Always use the R dev version to write a package.  Not the current stable release.  The R people use the R dev version to check your package anyway.  If you don’t use the R dev version, there is chance that your package won’t pass the check.  In my own experience, every time R has a major change, it tends to have new standards and find new errors in your package with these new standards.  So better use the dev version to find out the potential errors in advance.


 2. After submission, write an email to claim it.   I used to submit the package to the CRAN without writing an email.  This was standard operating procedure, but it has changed. Writing an email to claim about the submission is now a requir</p><p>4 0.15883125 <a title="2069-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-04-Stan_%28%26_JAGS%29_Tutorial_on_Linear_Mixed_Models.html">2318 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-04-Stan (& JAGS) Tutorial on Linear Mixed Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Shravan Vasishth sent me an earlier draft of this tutorial he co-authored with Tanner Sorensen.  I liked it, asked if I could blog about it, and in response, they’ve put together a convenient web page with links to the tutorial PDF, JAGS and Stan programs, and data:
 
 Fitting linear mixed models using JAGS and Stan: A tutorial 
 
The tutorial’s aimed at psycholinguists in particular and cognitive psychologists more generally, but it’s clear enough to be understood by anyone.  Plus, the psycholinguistic data is a lot of fun.
 
There’s contact info on the tutorial itself if you want to send the authors feedback directly.
 
I have to say I’m very psyched to see other people writing tutorials for Stan for particular application areas of interest.</p><p>5 0.11565842 <a title="2069-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-A_new_R_package_for_fititng_multilevel_models.html">501 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-A new R package for fititng multilevel models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joscha Legewie points to  this article  by Lars Ronnegard, Xia Shen, and Moudud Alam, “hglm: A Package for Fitting Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models,” which just appeared in the R journal.  This new package has the advantage, compared to lmer(), of allowing non-normal distributions for the varying coefficients.  On the downside, they seem to have reverted to the ugly lme-style syntax (for example, “fixed = y ~ week, random = ~ 1|ID” rather than “y ~ week + (1|D)”).  The old-style syntax has difficulties handling non-nested grouping factors.  They also say they can estimated models with correlated random effects, but isn’t that just the same as varying-intercept, varying-slope models, which lmer (or Stata alternatives such as gllam) can already do?  There’s also a bunch of stuff on H-likelihood theory, which seems pretty pointless to me (although probably it won’t do much harm either).
 
In any case, this package might be useful to some of you, hence this note.</p><p>6 0.10845505 <a title="2069-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-21-Instead_of_%E2%80%9Cconfidence_interval%2C%E2%80%9D_let%E2%80%99s_say_%E2%80%9Cuncertainty_interval%E2%80%9D.html">480 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-21-Instead of “confidence interval,” let’s say “uncertainty interval”</a></p>

A couple of months ago, you were visiting the University of Groningen, and after the talk you gave there I spoke briefly with you about a study that I conducted with Richard Morey, Jeff Rouder and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers. In the study, we found that researchers’  knowledge of how to interpret a confidence interval (CI), was almost as limited as the knowledge of students who had had no inferential statistics course yet. Our manuscript was recently accepted for publication in  Psychonomic Bulletin & Review , and it’s now available online (see e.g.,  here ). Maybe it’s interesting to discuss on your blog, especially since CIs are often promoted (for example in the new guidelines of Psychological Science ), but apparently researchers seem to have little idea how to interpret them. Given that the confidence percentage of a CI tells something about the procedure rather than about the data at hand, this might be understandable, but, according to us, it’s problematic neve</p><p>3 0.67851704 <a title="2069-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-27-%E2%80%9CWhat_Can_we_Learn_from_the_Many_Labs_Replication_Project%3F%E2%80%9D.html">2227 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-27-“What Can we Learn from the Many Labs Replication Project?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aki points us to  this discussion  from Rolf Zwaan:
  
The first massive replication project in psychology has just reached completion (several others are to follow). . . . What can we learn from the ManyLabs project? The results here show the effect sizes for the replication efforts (in green and grey) as well as the original studies (in blue). The 99% confidence intervals are for the meta-analysis of the effect size (the green dots); the studies are ordered by effect size.


 


Let’s first consider what we canNOT learn from these data. Of the 13 replication attempts (when the first four are taken together), 11 succeeded and 2 did not (in fact, at some point ManyLabs suggests that a third one, Imagined Contact also doesn’t really replicate). We cannot learn from this that the vast majority of psychological findings will replicate . . .


But even if we had an accurate estimate of the percentage of findings that replicate, how useful would that be?

You may be interested in  a recent article  [by Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann, and Wagenmakers] showing how often researchers draw conclusions by comparing p-values. As you and Hal Stern have pointed out, this is potentially misleading because the difference between significant and not significant is not necessarily significant.


We were really suprised to see how often researchers in the neurosciences make this mistake. In the paper we speculate a little bit on the cause of the error.
  
From their paper:
  
In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other 
is not (P > 0.05).

I read your  post  the other day [now the other month, as our blog is on a bit of a delay] on helping psychologists do research and thought you might be interested in our R package, “bootES”, for robust effect size calculation and confidence interval estimation using resampling techniques. The package provides one function, ‘bootES’, that makes a variety of effect size calculations fairly straightforward for researchers with limited programming experience.  The majority of the implemented are not available in R or SPSS without custom coding. Kris Kirby (Williams College) and I have published a paper in Behavioral Research Methods describing the methods and providing a tutorial on use of the package: http://bit.ly/YIM6VD. We hope that it’s useful to psychologists and other social science researchers!
  
I haven’t tried this out but it might be of interest for some of you.</p><p>2 0.90867388 <a title="2069-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-30-Why_don%E2%80%99t_we_have_peer_reviewing_for_oral_presentations%3F.html">172 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-30-Why don’t we have peer reviewing for oral presentations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Panos Ipeirotis  writes in his blog  post :
  

Everyone who has attended a conference knows that the quality of the talks is very uneven. There are talks that are highly engaging, entertaining, and describe nicely the research challenges and solutions. And there are talks that are a waste of time. Either the presenter cannot present clearly, or the presented content is impossible to digest within the time frame of the presentation.


We already have reviewing for the written part. The program committee examines the quality of the written  paper and vouch for its technical content. However, by looking at a paper it is impossible to know how nicely it can be presented. Perhaps the seemingly solid but boring paper can be a very entertaining presentation. Or an excellent paper may be written by a horrible presenter.


Why not having a second round of reviewing, where the authors of accepted papers submit their presentations (slides and a YouTube video) for presentation to the conference.</p><p>3 0.90709811 <a title="2069-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-25-Apply_now_for_Earth_Institute_postdoctoral_fellowships_at_Columbia_University.html">971 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-25-Apply now for Earth Institute postdoctoral fellowships at Columbia University</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The economy isn’t going so well, but there are some interesting possibilities here at Columbia University.  One such option that you should be thinking about is the  Earth Institute Fellowship , which pays well, includes a research stipend, and puts you in an exciting interdisciplinary community of faculty and postdoctoral researchers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia brings in several postdocs each year–it’s a two-year gig–and some of them have been statisticians (recently, Kenny Shirley and Leontine Alkema).  We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health.  It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.  The EI postdoc can be a place to do interesting work and begin a research career.
 
If you’re a statistician who’s interested in this fellowship, feel free to contact me directly–you have to apply to the Earth Institute directly (see link above), but I’m happy to give you advice about</p><p>4 0.90151167 <a title="2069-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Modeling_constrained_parameters.html">234 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Modeling constrained parameters</a></p>

In general, is there any way to do MCMC with a fixed constraint?


E.g., suppose I measure the three internal angles of a triangle with errors ~dnorm(0, tau) where tau might be different for the three measurements.  This would be an easy BUGS/WinBUGS/JAGS exercise but suppose, in addition, I wanted to include prior information to the effect that the three angles had to total 180 degrees exactly.


Is this feasible? Could you point me to any BUGS model in which a constraint of this type is implemented?


Note: Even in my own (non-hierarchical) code which tends to be component-wise, random-walk Metropolis with tuned Laplacian proposals, I cannot see how I could incorporate such a constraint.
  
My reply:  See page 508 of Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd edition).  We have an example of such a model there (from  this paper  with Bois and Jiang).</p><p>5 0.90068167 <a title="2069-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-12-Crime_novels_for_economists.html">1852 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-12-Crime novels for economists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on  this post  by Noah Smith on economics in science fiction, Mark Palko  writes  on economics in crime fiction.
 
Just as almost all science fiction is ultimately about politics, one could say that just about all crime fiction is about economics.
 
But if I had to pick one crime novelist with an economics focus, Iâ&euro;&trade;d pick George V. Higgins.  In one of his novels, his character Jerry Kennedy had a riff on the difference between guys who get a salary and guys who have to work for every dollar.  But, really, almost all his novels are full of economics.</p><p>6 0.89890438 <a title="2069-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>

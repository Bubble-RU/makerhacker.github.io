<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”

Actually, just about nobody likes modern art.  All those soup cans—what’s that all about?  The stuff they have in museums nowadays, my 4-year-old could do better than that.  Two-thirds of so-called modern artists are drunk and two-thirds are frauds.  And, no, I didn’t get my math wrong—there’s just a lot of overlap among these categories!

<p>Introduction: I opened the newspaper today (recall that this blog is on an approximately one-month delay) to see a moderately horrifying  story  about art appraisers who are deterred by fear of lawsuits from expressing an opinion about possible forgeries.
 
Maybe this trend will come to science too?  Perhaps Brett Pelham will sue Uri Simonsohn for the pain, suffering, and loss of income occurring from the  questioning of his Dennis the dentist paper ?  Or maybe I’ll be sued by some rogue sociologist for publicly questioning his data dredging?
 
Anyway, what amused me about the NYT article on art forgery was that two of the artists featured in the discussion were . . . Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein!  Warhol is famous for diluting the notion of the unique art object and for making works of art in a “Factory,” and Lichtenstein is famous for ripping off the style and imagery of comic book artists.  It’s funny for the two of them, of all people, to come up in a discussion of authenticity.  Or maybe it</p><p>5 0.23297705 <a title="1785-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-30-Real_rothko%2C_fake_rothko.html">1553 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-30-Real rothko, fake rothko</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  writes :
  
I know that in art, quality and value are two very different things.  Still, I had to stop and wonder when I read about

 
Domenico and Eleanore De Sole, who in 2004 paid $8.3 million for a painting attributed to Mark Rothko that they now say is a worthless fake.
 

One day a painting is worth $8.3 million; the next day, the same painting – same quality, same capacity to give aesthetic pleasure or do whatever it is that art does – is “worthless.”*  Art forgery also makes me wonder about the buyer’s motive.  If the buyer wanted only to have and to gaze upon something beautiful, something with artistic merit, then a fake Rothko is no different than a real Rothko.  It seems more likely that what the buyer wants is to own something valuable – i.e., something that costs a lot. Displaying your brokerage account statements is just too crude and obvious.  What the high-end art market offers is a kind of money laundering.

<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>2 0.93505323 <a title="1785-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-Ethics_and_statistics_in_development_research.html">241 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-Ethics and statistics in development research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.

<p>Introduction: Dan Lakeland  asks :
  
When are statistical graphics potentially life threatening?  When they’re poorly designed, and used to make decisions on potentially life threatening topics, like medical decision making, engineering design, and the like.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has dropped the ball on communicating to physicians about infant jaundice.  Another message in this post is that bad decisions can compound each other.
  
It’s an interesting story (follow the link above for the details), would be great for a class in decision analysis or statistical communication.  I have no idea how to get from A to B here, in the sense of persuading hospitals to do this sort of thing better.  I’d guess the first step is to carefully lay out costs and benefits.  When doctors and nurses make extra precautions for safety, it could be useful to lay out the ultimate goals and estimate the potential costs and benefits of different approaches.</p><p>4 0.93268931 <a title="1785-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-More_by_Berger_and_me_on_weakly_informative_priors.html">1092 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-More by Berger and me on weakly informative priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.
  
I have a few reactions to this:

<p>Introduction: We were talking about parallelizing MCMC and I came up with what I thought was a neat idea for parallelizing MCMC (sample with fractional prior, average samples on a per-draw basis).  But then I realized this approach could get the right posterior mean or right posterior variance, but not both, depending on how the prior was divided (for a beta-binomial example).  Then  Aki  told me it had already been done in a more general form in a paper of Scott et al.,  Bayes and Big Data , which was then used as the baseline in: 
 
Willie Neiswanger, Chong Wang, and Eric Xing. 2013.   Asymptotically Exact, Embarrassingly Parallel MCMC .  arXiv  1311.4780. 
 
It’s a neat paper, which Xi’an  already blogged  about months ago.  But what really struck me was the following quote:
  

We use Stan, an automated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) software package, to perform sampling for both the true posterior (for groundtruth and comparison methods) and for the subposteriors on each machine.

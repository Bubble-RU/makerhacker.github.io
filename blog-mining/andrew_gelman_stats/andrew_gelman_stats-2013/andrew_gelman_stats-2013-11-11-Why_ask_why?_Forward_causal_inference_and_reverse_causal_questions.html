<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>4 0.12973085 <a title="2097-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-16-Long_discussion_about_causal_inference_and_the_use_of_hierarchical_models_to_bridge_between_different_inferential_settings.html">1418 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-16-Long discussion about causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent. In other words, if one agrees with the assumptions encoded in the model, one must also agree with the conclusions entailed by these assumptions. I am not aware of any other way of doing mathematics.

<p>Introduction: Psychologists talk about “folk psychology”:  ideas that make sense to us about how people think and behave, even if these ideas are not accurate descriptions of reality.  And physicists talk about “folk physics” (for example, the idea that a thrown ball falls in a straight line and then suddenly drops, rather than following an approximate parabola).
 
There’s also “folk statistics.”  Some of the ideas of folk statistics are so strong that even educated people–even well-known researchers–can make these mistakes.
 
One of the ideas of folk statistics that bothers me a lot is what might be called the “either/or fallacy”:  the idea that if there are two possible stories, the truth has to be one or the other.
 
I have often encountered the either/or fallacy in Bayesian statistics, for example the vast literature on “model selection” or “variable selection” or “model averaging” in which it is assumed that one of some pre-specified discrete set of models is the truth, and that this true model</p><p>6 0.12266607 <a title="2097-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-Estimates_of_war_deaths%3A__Darfur_edition.html">64 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-Estimates of war deaths:  Darfur edition</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

<p>Introduction: Lei Liu writes:
  
 
I am working with clinicians in infectious disease and international health to study the (possible causal) relation between malnutrition and virus infection episodes (e.g., diarrhea) in babies in developing countries.


Basically the clinicians are interested in two questions: does malnutrition cause more diarrhea episodes? does diarrhea lead to malnutrition? The malnutrition status is indicated by height and weight (adjusted, HAZ and WAZ measures) observed every 3 months from birth to 1 year. They also recorded the time of each diarrhea episode during the 1 year follow-up period. They have very solid datasets for analysis.


As you can see, this is almost like a chicken and egg problem. I am a layman to causal inference. The method I use is just to do some simple regression.

<p>Introduction: Guido Imbens and I  write :
  
The statistical and econometrics literature on causality is more focused on “effects of causes” than on “causes of effects.” That is, in the standard approach it is natural to study the effect of a treatment, but it is not in general possible to define the causes of any particular outcome. This has led some researchers to dismiss the search for causes as “cocktail party chatter” that is outside the realm of science. We argue here that the search for causes can be understood within traditional statistical frameworks as a part of model checking and hypothesis generation. We argue that it can make sense to ask questions about the causes of effects, but the answers to these questions will be in terms of effects of causes.
  
We also  posted  the paper on NBER so I’m hoping it will get some attention from economists.  [Again,  here's  the open link to the paper.]  I think what we have here is an important idea linking statistical and econometric models of caus</p><p>2 0.91853333 <a title="2097-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-20-Adding_more_information_can_make_the_variance_go_up_%28depending_on_your_model%29.html">810 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-20-Adding more information can make the variance go up (depending on your model)</a></p>

Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability.

<p>Introduction: Rob Tibshirani  writes :
  
Hastie et al. (2001) coined the informal “Bet on Sparsity” principle. The l1 methods assume that the truth is sparse, in some basis. If the assumption holds true, then the parameters can be efficiently estimated using l1 penalties. If the assumption does not hold—so that the truth is dense—then no method will be able to recover the underlying model without a large amount of data per parameter.
  
I’ve earlier  expressed  my full and sincere appreciation for Hastie and Tibshirani’s work in this area.
 
Now I’d like to briefly comment on the above snippet.  The question is, how do we think about the “bet on sparsity” principle in a world where the truth  is  dense?  I’m thinking here of social science, where no effects are clean and no coefficient is zero (see page 960 of  this article  or various blog discussions in the past few years), where every contrast is meaningful—but some of these contrasts might be lost in the noise with any realistic size of data.</p><p>5 0.91599178 <a title="2097-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-15-How_I_think_about_mixture_models.html">1459 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-15-How I think about mixture models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman  refers  to finite mixture models as “beasts” and  writes  jokes that they “should be avoided at all costs.”
 
I’ve thought a lot about mixture models, ever since using them in an  analysis  of voting patterns that was published in 1990.  First off, I’d like to say that our model was useful so I’d prefer not to pay the cost of avoiding it.  For a quick description of our mixture model and its context, see pp. 379-380 of my  article  in the Jim Berger volume).  Actually, our case was particularly difficult because we were not even fitting a mixture model to data, we were fitting it to latent data and using the model to perform partial pooling.  My difficulties in trying to fit this model inspired our discussion of mixture models in Bayesian Data Analysis (page 109 in the second edition, in the section on “Counterexamples to the theorems”).
 
I agree with Larry that if you’re fitting a mixture model, it’s good to be aware of the problems that arise if you try to estimate</p><p>6 0.91284192 <a title="2097-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-News_coverage_of_statistical_issues%E2%80%A6how_did_I_do%3F.html">514 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-News coverage of statistical issues…how did I do?</a></p>

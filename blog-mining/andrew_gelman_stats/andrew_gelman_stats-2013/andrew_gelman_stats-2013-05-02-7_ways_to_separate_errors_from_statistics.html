<p>Introduction: Jeff Ratto points me to  this  news article by Dean Baker reporting the work of three economists, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who  found  errors in a much-cited  article  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff analyzing historical statistics of economic growth and public debt.  Mike Konczal  provides  a clear summary; that’s where I got the above image.
 
 Errors in data processing and data analysis 
 
It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff flubbed it.  Herndon et al. write of “spreadsheet errors, omission of available data, weighting, and transcription.”  The spreadsheet errors are the most embarrassing, but the other choices in data analysis seem pretty bad too.  It can be tough to work with small datasets, so I have sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, but it does look like they were jumping to conclusions in their paper.  Perhaps the urgency of the topic moved them to publish as fast as possible rather than carefully considering the impact of their data-analytic choi</p><p>3 0.18507037 <a title="1835-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-25-Is_there_too_much_coauthorship_in_economics_%28and_science_more_generally%29%3F__Or_too_little%3F.html">1914 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-25-Is there too much coauthorship in economics (and science more generally)?

<p>Introduction: Economist Stan Liebowitz has a  longstanding interest  in the difficulties of flagging published research errors.  Recently he wrote on the related topic of dishonest authorship:
  
While not about direct research fraud, I thought you might be interested in  this paper . It discusses the manner in which credit is given for economics articles, and I suspect it applies to many other areas as well. One of the conclusions is that the lack of complete proration per author will lead to excessive coauthorship, reducing overall research output by inducing the use of larger than efficient-sized teams. Under these circumstances, false authorship can be a response to the warped reward system and false authorship might improve research efficiency since it might keep actual research teams (as opposed to nominal teams) from being too large to produce research efficiently. One of the questions I rhetorically ask in the paper is whether anyone has ever been ‘punished’ for having their name included on</p><p>4 0.15011077 <a title="1835-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-08-Econ_debate_about_prices_at_a_fancy_restaurant.html">1105 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-08-Econ debate about prices at a fancy restaurant</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon  writes :
  
Economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson  have a problem  with Grant Achatz’s pricing strategy at Next, where tickets are sold at a fixed price and are then free to be resold at an enormous markup on the secondary market . . .

 
“It’s democratic in theory, but not in practice,” said Wolfers . . .


If a person can sell a ticket for $3,000, the true cost of going to the restaurant — what an economist would call the opportunity cost — is $3000, because that’s how much money the person is giving up for the meal.
 

Bloomberg’s Mark Whitehouse concludes that Next should “consider selling tickets to the highest bidder and giving the extra money to charity” . . .
  
What strikes me is how weird this discussion is.  Why should this restaurant owner have some sort of moral obligation to maximize his income and then donate to charity?  For one thing, if he really did make more money off the deal he might just keep it.  But more to the point, this sort of maximiz</p><p>5 0.14133981 <a title="1835-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-19-Further_thoughts_on_happiness_and_life_satisfaction_research.html">98 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-19-Further thoughts on happiness and life satisfaction research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups.

<p>Introduction: Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall, authors of  that paper  that claimed that women at peak fertility were more likely to wear red or pink shirts (see further discussion  here  and  here ), and then a later paper that claimed that this happens in some weather but not others, just informed me that they have posted a note in disagreement with an paper by Eric Loken and myself.
 
Our paper is unpublished, but I do have the megaphone of this blog, and Tracy and Beall do not, so I think it’s only fair to link to their note right away.  I’ll quote from their note (but if you’re interested,  please follow the link and read the whole thing ) and then give some background and my own reaction.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  my post  responding to his question about that controversial claim that high genetic diversity, or low genetic diversity, is bad for the economy, Kyle Peyton writes:
  
I’m happy to see you’ve articulated similar gripes I had w/ the piece, which makes me feel like I’m not crazy. I remember discussing this with colleagues (I work at a research institute w/ economists) and only a couple of them shared any concern. It seems that by virtue of being published in ‘the AER’ the results are unquestionable. I agree that the idea is interesting and worth pursuing but as you say it’s one thing to go from that to asserting ‘causality’ (I still don’t know what definition of causality they’re using?). All the data torture along the way is just tipping the hat to convention rather than serving any scientific purpose.
  
Some researchers are so uptight about identification that, when they think they have it, all their skepticism dissolves.

<p>Introduction: For the past several months I’ve been circling around and around some questions related to the issue of how we build trust in statistical methods and statistical results.  There are lots of examples but let me start with my own career.  My most cited publications are my books and my methods papers, but I think that much of my credibility as a statistical researcher comes from my applied work.  It somehow matters, I think, when judging my statistical work, that I’ve done (and continue to do) real research in social and environmental science.
 
Why is this?  It’s not just that my applied work gives me good examples for my textbooks.  It’s also that the applied work motivated the new methods.  Most of the successful theory and methods that my collaborators and I have developed, we developed in the context of trying to solve active applied problems.

I am a sociologist/criminologist working at Statistics Norway. As I am not a trained statistician, I find myself sometimes in need to check basic statistical concepts. Recently, I came across an article which I found a bit strange, but I needed to check up on my statistical understanding of a very basic concept: the r-squared. When doing so, I realized that this was also an interesting case of research ethics. Given your interest in research ethics, I though this might be interesting to you.


 Here’s  the mentioned article, by Weisburd and Piquero, is attached. What they do is to analyzed reported results from all articles published in the highest ranking criminological journal since 1968 through 2005 to determine whether there are any progress in the field of criminology. Their approach is basically to calculate the average r-square from linear models in published articles. For example, they state that “variance explained provides one way to assess</p><p>6 0.76830715 <a title="1835-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers have been inspired by the recent Reinhardt and Rogoff  debacle  to  list  “six ways to separate lies from statistics” in economics research:
  
1. “Focus on how robust a finding is, meaning that different ways of looking at the evidence point to the same conclusion.”


2.  Don’t confuse statistical with practical significance.


3.  “Be wary of scholars using high-powered statistical techniques as a bludgeon to silence critics who are not specialists.”


4.  “Don’t fall into the trap of thinking about an empirical finding as ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ At best, data provide an imperfect guide.”


5.  “Don’t mistake correlation for causation.”


6.  “Always ask ‘so what?’”
  
I like all these points, especially #4, which I think doesn’t get said enough.  As I  wrote  a few months ago, high-profile social science research aims for proof, not for understanding—and that’s a problem.

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture. And when we look at world-wide revenues, this film brought in more than $1.5 billion. . . . Despite what seems like a clear endorsement by the customers of this industry, the Avengers was ignored by the Oscars.  Perhaps this is just because I am an econo</p><p>4 0.8964889 <a title="1835-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-A_calibrated_Cook_gives_Dems_the_edge_in_Nov%2C_sez_Sandy.html">300 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-A calibrated Cook gives Dems the edge in Nov, sez Sandy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>5 0.89265597 <a title="1835-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-28-A_convenience_sample_and_selected_treatments.html">1551 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-28-A convenience sample and selected treatments</a></p>

A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.18195806 <a title="1684-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>4 0.16603412 <a title="1684-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Graph_of_the_year.html">488 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Graph of the year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From blogger  Matthew Yglesias :
 
 
 
There are lots of great graphs all over the web (see, for example,  here  and  here  for some snappy pictures of unemployment trends from blogger “Geoff”).
 
There’s nothing special about Yglesias’s graph.  In fact, the reason I’m singling it out as “graph of the year” is  because  it’s not special.
  

 
It’s a display of three numbers, with no subtlety or artistry in its presentation.  True, it has some good features: 
- Clear title 
- Clearly labeled axes 
- Vertical axis goes to zero 
- The cities are in a sensible order (not, for example, alphabetical) 
- The graphs is readable; none of that 3-D “data visualization” crap that looks cool but distances the reader from the numbers being displayed.
 
What’s impressive about the above graph, what makes it a landmark to me, is that it was made at all.  As noted in the text immediately below the image, it’s a display of exactly three numbers which can with little effort be completely presented and e</p><p>5 0.15828434 <a title="1684-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs_in_information_graphics.html">1584 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs in information graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.  It represents neither a dat</p><p>3 0.89553267 <a title="1684-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-01-A_book_with_a_bunch_of_simple_graphs.html">1439 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-01-A book with a bunch of simple graphs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.

<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>5 0.84926355 <a title="1684-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-More_data_tools_worth_using_from_Google.html">911 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-More data tools worth using from Google</a></p>

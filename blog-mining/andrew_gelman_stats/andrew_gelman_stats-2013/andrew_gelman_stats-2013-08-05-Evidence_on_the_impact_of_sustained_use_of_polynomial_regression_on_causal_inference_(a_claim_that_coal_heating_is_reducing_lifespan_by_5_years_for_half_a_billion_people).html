This paper’s findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China’s Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north.

</p><p>5 It looks like that’s where the claim of 5 years of life expectancy came from. [sent-24, score-0.864]
</p><p>6 The cubic adjustment gave an estimated effect of 5. [sent-32, score-0.298]
</p><p>7 Figure 3 above indicates to me that neither the linear nor the cubic nor any other polynomial model is appropriate here; that there are other variables not included in the model that distinguish the circles in the graph. [sent-39, score-0.543]

</p><p>9 )   To get back to the main conclusions:  There might well be good reasons for expecting an effect of even more than 5 years of life expectancy from this policy—I don’t know anything about this topic—but,  from the above data alone , the claim of 5 years looks artifactual. [sent-45, score-1.182]
</p><p>10 And, there also seems to be an implication that, in those northern areas with life expectancy around 80, that people would be living to 85 in the absence of the policy. [sent-46, score-0.696]
</p><p>11 What I am suggesting is a two-step:  the authors retreat from their strongly model-based claim of statistical significance, and the journal accept that non-statistically-significant findings on important topics are still worth publishing. [sent-54, score-0.355]

</p><p>19 That’s a regression discontinuity right there, and researchers in various fields have found evidence that it introduces some endogeneity in the selection variable. [sent-86, score-0.321]

<p>Introduction: Following up on my regression-discontinuity post from the other day, Brad DeLong  writes :
  
The feel (and I could well be wrong) as that at some point somebody said: “This is very important, but it won’t get published without a statistically significant headline finding. Torture the data via specification search until we find a statistically significant effect so that this can get published!”
  
I think DeLong is mistaken here.  But, before getting to this, here’s the graph: 
   
 
 
and here are the regression results:
 
  
 
So, indeed it is that cubic term that takes the result into statistical significance.
 
The reason I disagree with DeLong is that it’s my impression that, in econometrics and applied economics, it’s considered the safe, conservative choice in regression discontinuity to control for a high-degree polynomial.  See the paper discussed a few years ago  here , for example, where I criticized a pair of economists for using a fifth-degree specification and they replie</p><p>3 0.2664046 <a title="1968-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-25-Health_disparities_are_associated_with_low_life_expectancy.html">1548 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-25-Health disparities are associated with low life expectancy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: I had a couple of email exchanges with Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and James Fowler, two of the authors of the article on the gene that is associated with life satisfaction which we  blogged  the other day.  (Bruno Frey, the third author of the article in question, is out of town according to his email.)  Fowler also commented  directly  on the blog.
 
I won’t go through all the details, but now I have a better sense of what’s going on.  (Thanks, Jan and James!)  Here’s my current understanding:
 
 1.   The original manuscript was divided into two parts:   an article  by De Neve alone published in the Journal of Human Genetics, and  an article  by De Neve, Fowler, Frey, and Nicholas Christakis submitted to Econometrica.  The latter paper repeats the analysis from the Adolescent Health survey and also replicates with data from the Framingham heart study (hence Christakis’s involvement).

<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

See the paper discussed a few years ago  here , for example, where I criticized a pair of economists for using a fifth-degree specification and they replie</p><p>4 0.8034448 <a title="1968-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-27-A_whole_fleet_of_gremlins%3A__Looking_more_carefully_at_Richard_Tol%E2%80%99s_twice-corrected_paper%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_Economic_Effects_of_Climate_Change%E2%80%9D.html">2350 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-27-A whole fleet of gremlins:  Looking more carefully at Richard Tol’s twice-corrected paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We had a  discussion  the other day of a paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change,” by economist Richard Tol.
 
The paper came to my attention after I saw a  notice  from Adam Marcus that it was recently revised because of data errors.  But after looking at the paper more carefully, I see a bunch of other problems that, to me, make the whole analysis close to useless as it stands.
 
I think this is worth discussing because the paper has been somewhat influential (so far cited 328 times, according to Google Scholar) and has even been cited in the  popular press  as evidence that “Climate change has done more good than harm so far and is likely to continue doing so for most of this century . . . There are many likely effects of climate change: positive and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial. And if you aggregate them all, the overall effect is positive today — and likely to stay positive until around 2080. That was the conclusion of Professor Richard Tol</p><p>5 0.80290163 <a title="1968-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-28-Difficulties_of_using_statistical_significance_%28or_lack_thereof%29_to_sift_through_and_compare_research_hypotheses.html">2042 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-28-Difficulties of using statistical significance (or lack thereof) to sift through and compare research hypotheses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes , “people tend to like cities more than firms . . . people tend to dislike bigger firms more than small ones, cities tend to be bigger than firms, and the biggest cities tend to be the most celebrated.”
 
Hansen goes on to consider explanations (involving “the joy of sometimes dominating,” etc.) but ends up describing himself as confused.
 
One reason he might be confused is that, at least in the data I’ve seen, people  don’t  dislike big corporations—at least not when the corporation is named.
 
Consider some  survey data  from 2007:
 
   
 
OK, sure, now that there’s a recession on, Citibank probably doesn’t have 78% approval anymore.  Still, these companies are pretty damn popular.  You might think lots of Americans think Starbucks is stuck-up?  Nope.  79% approval.  Pfizer?  77%.  I have no idea why Target is so much more popular than Walmart, but in any case all these numbers (with the exception of oil-spillin’ Exxon and war-profitin’ Halliburton) are stratosp</p><p>3 0.97082865 <a title="1968-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-25-Dyson%E2%80%99s_baffling_love_of_crackpots.html">1281 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-25-Dyson’s baffling love of crackpots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  reports  on the sympathy that well-known physicist Freeman Dyson has with crackpot theorists.  The interesting part is that Dyson has positive feelings for these cranks,  even while believing that their theories are completely wrong :
  
In my [Dyson's] career as a scientist, I twice had the good fortune to be a personal friend of a famous dissident. One dissident, Sir Arthur Eddington, was an insider like Thomson and Tait. The other, Immanuel Velikovsky, was an outsider like Carter. Both of them were tragic figures, intellectually brilliant and morally courageous, with the same fatal flaw as Carter. Both of them were possessed by fantasies that people with ordinary common sense could recognize as nonsense. I made it clear to both that I did not believe their fantasies, but I admired them as human beings and as imaginative artists. I admired them most of all for their stubborn refusal to remain silent. With the whole world against them, they remained true to their beliefs.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.96969903 <a title="1968-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-05-Evidence_on_the_impact_of_sustained_use_of_polynomial_regression_on_causal_inference_%28a_claim_that_coal_heating_is_reducing_lifespan_by_5_years_for_half_a_billion_people%29.html">1968 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-05-Evidence on the impact of sustained use of polynomial regression on causal inference (a claim that coal heating is reducing lifespan by 5 years for half a billion people)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yu Xie thought I’d have something to say about  this recent paper , “Evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy from China’s Huai River policy,” by Yuyu Chen, Avraham Ebenstein, Michael Greenstone, and Hongbin Li, which begins:
  
This paper’s findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China’s Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectanci</p><p>5 0.96823883 <a title="1968-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-There_are_four_ways_to_get_fired_from_Caesars%3A__%281%29_theft%2C_%282%29_sexual_harassment%2C_%283%29_running_an_experiment_without_a_control_group%2C_and_%284%29_keeping_a_gambling_addict_away_from_the_casino.html">1619 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-There are four ways to get fired from Caesars:  (1) theft, (2) sexual harassment, (3) running an experiment without a control group, and (4) keeping a gambling addict away from the casino</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.

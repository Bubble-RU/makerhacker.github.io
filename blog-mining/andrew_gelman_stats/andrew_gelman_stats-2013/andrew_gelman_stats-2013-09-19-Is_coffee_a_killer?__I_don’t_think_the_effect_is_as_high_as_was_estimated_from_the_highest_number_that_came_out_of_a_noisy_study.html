On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>4 0.1203906 <a title="2030-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Controversy_about_average_personality_differences_between_men_and_women.html">1114 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Controversy about average personality differences between men and women</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).

<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.


Specifically, the so-called P value — a mathematical measure of the strength of the evidence that there’s a true difference between a treatment and placebo — was 0.08. . . .

<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>5 0.81777185 <a title="2030-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-Setting_aside_the_politics%2C_the_debate_over_the_new_health-care_study_reveals_that_we%E2%80%99re_moving_to_a_new_high_standard_of_statistical_journalism.html">1838 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-Setting aside the politics, the debate over the new health-care study reveals that we’re moving to a new high standard of statistical journalism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing to this  news article  by Megan McArdle discussing a recent study of Medicaid recipients, Jonathan Falk writes:
  
Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.
 

and

 
A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Lumley  writes :
  
 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>2 0.96599472 <a title="2030-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-15-The_UN_Plot_to_Force_Bayesianism_on_Unsuspecting_Americans_%28penalized_B-Spline_edition%29.html">2135 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-15-The UN Plot to Force Bayesianism on Unsuspecting Americans (penalized B-Spline edition)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat sent me an email with the above heading, referring to  this paper  by Leontine Alkema and Jin Rou New, which begins:
  
National estimates of the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) are used to track progress in reducing child mortality and to evaluate countries’ performance related to United Nations Millennium Development Goal 4, which calls for a reduction in the U5MR by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. However, for the great majority of developing countries without well-functioning vital registration systems, estimating levels and trends in child mortality is challenging, not only because of limited data availability but also because of issues with data quality. Global U5MR estimates are often constructed without accounting for potential biases in data series, which may lead to inaccurate point estimates and/or credible intervals.


We describe a Bayesian penalized B-spline regression model for assessing levels and trends in the U5MR for all countries in the world, whereby bi</p><p>3 0.96272731 <a title="2030-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-The_scope_for_snooping.html">1070 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-The scope for snooping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys sent the following question to David Madigan and me: 
  
  
I am working on a piece on the registration of research designs (to prevent snooping). As part of it we want to give some estimates for the “scope for snooping” and how this can be affected by different registration requirements.


So we want to answer questions of the form: 
“Say in truth there is no relation between x and y, you were willing to mess about with models until you found a significant relation between them, what are the chances that you would succeed if: 
1. You were free to choose the indicators for x and y 
2. You were free to choose h control variable from some group of k possible 
controls 
3. You were free to divide up the sample in k ways to examine heterogeneous treatment effects 
4. You were free to select from some set of k reasonable models”

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung shares  this graph  from Ritchie King:
 
 
 
Kaiser writes:
  
What they did right:


- Did not put the data on a map 
- Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically 
- Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel 
- Only used three labels for the 11 years on the plot 
- Did not overdo the vertical scale either


The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go. I would have used smaller fonts throughout.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s comments. I could even add a few more, like using light gray for the backgrounds and a bright blue for the lines, spacing the graphs well, using full country names rather than three-letter abbreviations.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  discusses  the following  graph  that is captioned, “A study of 54 nations–ranked below–found that those with more progressive tax rates had happier citizens, on average.”
 
   
 
As Kaiser writes, “from a purely graphical perspective, the chart is well executed . . . they have 54 points, and the chart still doesn’t look too crammed . . .”  But he also points out that the graph’s implicit claims (that tax rates can explain happiness or cause more happiness) are not supported.
 
Kaiser and I are not being picky-picky-picky here.  Taken literally, the graph title says nothing about causation, but I think the phrasing implies it.  Also, from a purely descriptive perspective, the graph is somewhat at war with its caption.  The caption announces a relationship, but in the graph, the x and y variables have only a very weak correlation.  The caption says that happiness and progressive tax rates go together, but the graph uses the U.S. as a baseline, and when you move from the U.S</p><p>6 0.96002871 <a title="2030-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-Mmm%2C_statistical_significance_._._._Evilicious%21.html">2354 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-Mmm, statistical significance . . .

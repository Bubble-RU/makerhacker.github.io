<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>4 0.17839101 <a title="1668-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-25-A_statistical_graphics_course_and_statistical_graphics_advice.html">2266 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-25-A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):
 
- Think of a graph as a comparison.  All graphs are comparison (indeed, all statistical analyses are comparisons).  If you already have the graph in mind, think of what comparisons it’s enabling.  Or if you haven’t settled on the graph yet, think of what</p><p>5 0.17357942 <a title="1668-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>6 0.16314715 <a title="1668-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-What_goes_around_._._..html">548 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-What goes around . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.  My talk</p><p>5 0.64850354 <a title="1668-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-Just_gave_a_talk.html">2275 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-Just gave a talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>6 0.63586175 <a title="1668-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-11-Data_Visualization_vs._Statistical_Graphics.html">407 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-11-Data Visualization vs. Statistical Graphics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stephanie Evergreen writes:
  
 
Media, web design, and marketing have all created an environment where stakeholders – clients, program participants, funders – all expect high quality graphics and reporting that effectively conveys the valuable insights from evaluation work. Some in statistics and mathematics have used data visualization strategies to support more useful reporting of complex ideas. Global growing interest in improving communications has begun to take root in the evaluation field as well. But as anyone who has sat through a day’s worth of a conference or had to endure a dissertation-worthy evaluation report knows, evaluators still have a long way to go. To support the development of researchers and evaluators, some members of the American Evaluation Association are proposing a new TIG (Topical Interest Group) on Data Visualization and Reporting.  If you are a member of AEA (or want to be) and you are interested in joining this TIG,  contact  Stephanie Evergreen.</p><p>2 0.92808402 <a title="1668-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: It’s in midtown at 7pm  (on Mon 14 Jan 2013).
 
Last time I talked for this group, I spoke on  Infovis vs. Statistical Graphics .  This time I plan to just go thru the choices involved in a few zillion graphs I’ve published over the years, to give a sense of the options and choices involved in graphical communication. For this talk there will be no single theme (except, perhaps, my usual “Graphs as comparisons,” “All of statistics as comparisons,” and “Exploratory data analysis as hypothesis testing”), just a bunch of open discussion about what I tried, why I tried it, what worked and what didn’t work, etc. I’ve discussed these sorts of decisions on occasion (and am now writing a paper with Yair about some of this for our voting models), but I’ve never tried to make a talk out of it before. Could be fun.</p><p>4 0.9164865 <a title="1668-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-27-%E2%80%9CHow_to_Lie_with_Statistics%E2%80%9D_guy_worked_for_the_tobacco_industry_to_mock_studies_of_the_risks_of_smoking_statistics.html">1285 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-27-“How to Lie with Statistics” guy worked for the tobacco industry to mock studies of the risks of smoking statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>5 0.91442299 <a title="1668-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>6 0.90681028 <a title="1668-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-10-Presenting_at_the_econ_seminar.html">1050 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-10-Presenting at the econ seminar</a></p>

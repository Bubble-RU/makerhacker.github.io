</p><p>5 Berri points to other studies from hockey, soccer, and basketball that come to similar conclusions:  replacing a head coach does not, on average, lead to improvement. [sent-15, score-0.696]
</p><p>6 He concludes:    What these studies did is look at teams or players with different coaches and failed to find much of a difference. [sent-16, score-0.808]
</p><p>7 That suggests that coaches in sports are not very different from each other. [sent-17, score-0.588]
</p><p>8 It may be true (and more than likely very true) that you are better off with a professional coach than with a random person grabbed from the stands (or no one at all). [sent-18, score-0.611]

</p><p>11 I have not read the linked studies but, from Berri’s description, they found that a replacement coach is no better, on average, than the coach that came before. [sent-26, score-1.022]
</p><p>12 But how do you get from there to “it doesn’t appear that the choice of professional coach matters much”? [sent-27, score-0.663]

</p><p>15 Berri’s example seems more like a pure case of argument 2:  sports teams are spending millions of dollars on top coaches, and that’s a waste of money because professional coaches are essentially all the same. [sent-43, score-1.274]

<p>Introduction: In a thought-provoking article subtitled “Top athletes and singers have coaches. Should you?,” surgeon/journalist Atul Gawande  describes  how, even after eight years and more than two thousand operations, he benefited from coaching (from a retired surgeon), just as pro athletes and accomplished musicians do.  He then talks about proposals to institute coaching for teachers to help them perform better.
 
This all makes sense to me—except that I’m a little worried about expansion of the teacher coaching program.  I can imagine it could work pretty well for teachers who are motivated to be coached—for example, I think I would get a lot out of it—but I’m afraid that if teacher coaching became a big business, it would get taken over by McKinsey-style scam artists.
 
But could I use a coach?
 
First, let me get rid of the easy questions.
 
1.  Yes, I could use a squash coach.  I enjoy squash and play when I can, but I’m terrible at it.  I’m sure a coach would help.  On the other hand, I’m h</p><p>4 0.18024345 <a title="1804-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-30-Berri_Gladwell_Loken_football_update.html">2082 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-30-Berri Gladwell Loken football update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sports researcher Dave Berri had a disagreement with  a remark  in our recent discussion of Malcolm Gladwell.  Berri writes:
  
This post [from Gelman] contains the following paragraph:

 
Similarly, when Gladwell claimed that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college, he appears to have been wrong. But if you take his writing as stone soup, maybe it’s valuable: just retreat to the statement that there’s only a weak relationship between draft order and NFL performance. That alone is interesting. It’s too bad that Gladwell sometimes has to make false general statements in order to get our attention, but maybe that’s what is needed to shake people out of their mental complacency.
 

The above paragraph  links  to a blog post by Eric Loken.  This is something you have linked to before.  And when you linked to it before I tried to explain why Loken’s work is not very good.  Since you still think this work shows that Gladwell – and therefore Rob</p><p>5 0.17912717 <a title="1804-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-19-%E2%80%9COne_of_the_easiest_ways_to_differentiate_an_economist_from_almost_anyone_else_in_society%E2%80%9D.html">809 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-19-“One of the easiest ways to differentiate an economist from almost anyone else in society”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>6 0.15815394 <a title="1804-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-15-Economics_now_%3D_Freudian_psychology_in_the_1950s%3A__More_on_the_incoherence_of_%E2%80%9Ceconomics_exceptionalism%E2%80%9D.html">1213 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-15-Economics now = Freudian psychology in the 1950s:  More on the incoherence of “economics exceptionalism”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What follows is a long response to a comment on  someone else’s blog .  The quote is, “Thinking like an economist simply means that you scientifically approach human social behavior. . . .”
 
I’ll give the context in a bit, but first let me say that I thought this topic might be worth one more discussion because I suspect that the sort of economics exceptionalism that I will discuss is widely disseminated in college econ courses as well as in books such as the Freakonomics series.
 
It’s great to have pride in human achievements but at some point too much group self-regard can be distorting.
 
My best analogy to economics exceptionalism is Freudianism in the 1950s:  Back then, Freudian psychiatrists were on the top of the world.  Not only were they well paid, well respected, and secure in their theoretical foundations, they were also at the center of many important conversations.  Even those people who disagreed with them felt the need to explain why the Freudians were wrong.

<p>Introduction: According to a  New York Times article , cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have a new theory about rational argument: humans didn’t develop it in order to learn about the world, we developed it in order to win arguments with other people. “It was a purely social phenomenon. It evolved to help us convince others and to be careful when others try to convince us.” 
 
Based on the NYT article, it seems that Mercier and Sperber are basically flipping around the traditional argument, which is that humans learned to reason about the world, albeit imperfectly, and learned to use language to convey that reasoning to others.  These guys would suggest that it’s the other way around: we learned to argue with others, and this has gradually led to the ability to actually make (and recognize) sound arguments, but only indirectly.  The article says “”At least in some cultural contexts, this results in a kind of arms race towards greater sophistication in the production and evaluation o</p><p>4 0.77528149 <a title="1804-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-12-Probability_of_successive_wins_in_baseball.html">29 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-12-Probability of successive wins in baseball</a></p>

When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days, what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game?

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>6 0.73606491 <a title="1804-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Bidding_for_the_kickoff.html">559 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Bidding for the kickoff</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.  Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous”</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9629662 <a title="1804-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-15-How_effective_are_football_coaches%3F.html">1804 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-15-How effective are football coaches?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>3 0.95881414 <a title="1804-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Wacky_surveys_where_they_don%E2%80%99t_tell_you_the_questions_they_asked.html">385 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Wacky surveys where they don’t tell you the questions they asked</a></p>

The parenting club Bounty, which distributes their packs through midwives, hospitals, and large UK supermarket and pharmacy chains, commissioned a  fun little survey for Halloween from the company  OnePoll .

(One does wonder how a parenting club with such close links to the UK National Health Service thought a survey on this topic was at all appropriate, but that’s another rant.)


So far, so awful, but what I [Wolters] thought might grab your attention was the excuse OnePoll offered for their work in their email to Petra. (Petra is very well known in the UK, and so was able to get a statement from the polling company.) Here it is in its full glory, taken from Petra’s post:

<p>Introduction: From the  Gallup Poll :
  
Four in 10 Americans, slightly fewer today than in years past, believe God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago.
  
They’ve been asking the question since 1982 and it’s been pretty steady at 45%, so in some sense this is good news!  (I’m saying this under the completely unsupported belief that it’s better for people to believe truths than falsehoods.)
  

 
One way to think of this is that, for the overwhelming majority of people, a personal belief in young-earth creationism (or whatever you want to call it) is costless.  Or, to put it another way, the discomfort involved in holding a belief that contradicts everything you were taught in school is greater than the discomfort involved in holding a belief that seems to contradict your religious values (keeping in mind that, even among those who report attending church seldom or never, a quarter of these people agree that “God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago”).</p><p>5 0.94827741 <a title="1804-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-03-This_is_a_footnote_in_one_of_my_papers.html">448 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-03-This is a footnote in one of my papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the annals of hack literature, it is sometimes said that if you aim to write best-selling crap, all you’ll end up with is crap.  To truly produce best-selling crap, you have to have a conviction, perhaps misplaced, that your writing has integrity.  Whether or not this is a good generalization about writing, I have seen an analogous phenomenon in statistics:  If you try to do nothing but model the data, you can be in for a wild and unpleasant ride:  real data always seem to have one more twist beyond our ability to model (von Neumann’s elephant’s trunk notwithstanding).  But if you model the underlying process, sometimes your model can fit surprisingly well as well as inviting openings for future research progress.</p><p>6 0.94396675 <a title="1804-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-13-Statistical_controversy_regarding_human_rights_violations_in_Colomnbia.html">145 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-13-Statistical controversy regarding human rights violations in Colomnbia</a></p>

Salmon is dismissive of the claim that there are fifty million over-the-air television viewers:

 
The 50 million number, by the way, should not be considered particularly reliable: it’s Aereo’s guess as to the number of people who ever watch free-to-air TV, even if they mainly watch cable or satellite. (Maybe they have a hut somewhere with an old rabbit-ear TV in it.)
 

And he strongly suggests the number is not only smaller but shrinking. By comparison, here’s a story from the broadcasting news site TV News Check from June of last year (if anyone has more recent numbers please let me know):

 
According to new research by GfK Media, the number of Americans now relying solely on over-the-air (OTA) television reception increased to almost 54 million, up from 46 million just a year ago. The recently completed survey also found that the demographics of broadcast-only households skew towards younger adults, minorities and lower-income families.
 
  
As Palko says,</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 )    And he strongly suggests the number is not only smaller but shrinking. [sent-3, score-0.106]
</p><p>2 The recently completed survey also found that the demographics of broadcast-only households skew towards younger adults, minorities and lower-income families. [sent-5, score-0.065]
</p><p>3 What we haven’t covered so far is the potential social impact of killing broadcast television. [sent-9, score-0.223]
</p><p>4 It is almost axiomatic that, if you have a resource that is used in one way by people at the top of the economic ladder and in another way by people on the bottom and you “let the market decide” what to do with the resource, it will go with the people who have the money. [sent-10, score-0.516]
</p><p>5 This becomes particularly troubling when we’re talking about a publicly held resource. [sent-14, score-0.116]
</p><p>6 People in the bottom one or two deciles are going to be in trouble. [sent-20, score-0.151]
</p><p>7 Even the lowest tier of cable would represent a significant monthly expense. [sent-21, score-0.257]
</p><p>8 People with limited residential security will be even worse off. [sent-22, score-0.229]
</p><p>9 People with limited income security will face a difficult choice: sign up for exorbitant no-contract plans or commit to a financial obligation they may not be able to fulfill. [sent-23, score-0.296]
</p><p>10 People with poor credit histories will have to come up with large deposits every time they move. [sent-24, score-0.137]
</p><p>11 Palko summarizes:    OTA [over-the-air television] is a promising technology supporting an innovative and growing industry, serving important economic and social roles. [sent-28, score-0.176]
</p><p>12 The technology is doing fine in the marketplace. [sent-29, score-0.087]
</p><p>13 Is Palko missing something, or does he just happen to be sharing a perspective that is different from that of NYC-based financial journalists? [sent-32, score-0.069]
</p><p>14 There’s some dispute about that 54 million number. [sent-40, score-0.344]
</p><p>15 Salmon points to  this  news article by Michael Grotticelli:    Free, over-the-air television viewing of broadcast TV signals are now watched by only 9 percent of the U. [sent-41, score-0.941]
</p><p>16 population — down from 16 percent in 2003, according to Nielsen, the major TV and radio rating service. [sent-43, score-0.158]
</p><p>17 The Nielsen numbers are certain to cause a dispute with the NAB, which has insisted the amount of over-the-air viewing is increasing in an era of cord-cutting. [sent-47, score-0.277]
</p><p>18 Last summer, the NAB produced a survey by Knowledge Networks citing about 18 percent as “broadcast exclusive” households. [sent-48, score-0.099]
</p><p>19 That total was 54 million Americans — up from 46 million in 2011. [sent-49, score-0.488]
</p><p>20 So, one claim is that 9% watch any over-the-air TV, the other is that 18% only watch over-the-air TV. [sent-50, score-0.372]

At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . .

Mark Palko has an interesting  post  on the pace of changes in everyday life.  We’ve been hearing a lot in the past few decades about how things are changing faster and faster.  But, as Palko points out, the difference between life in 1962 and life today does not seem so different, at least for many people in the United States.  Sure, there are some big changes:  nonwhites get more respect, people mostly live longer, many cancers can be cured, fewer people are really really poor but it’s harder to hold down a job, cars are more reliable, you can get fresh fish in the suburbs, containers are lighter and stronger, vacations in the Caribbean instead of the Catskills, people have a lot more stuff and a lot more place to put it, etc etc etc.  But life in the 1950s or 1960s just doesn’t seem so different from how we live today.

<p>Introduction: This news article  by Ryan Tate is an amazing bit of sociology:
  
If you want Facebook to spend millions of dollars hiring you, it helps to be a talented engineer, as the New York Times today [18 May 2011] suggests. But it also helps to carouse with Facebook honchos, invite them to your dad’s Mediterranean party palace, and get them introduced to your father’s venture capital pals, like Sam Lessin did.


Lessin is the poster boy for today’s Times story on Facebook “talent acquisitions.” Facebook spent several million dollars to buy Lessin’s drop.io, only to shut it down and put Lessin to work on internal projects. To the Times, Lessin is an example of how “the best talent” fetches tons of money these days. “Engineers are worth half a million to one million,” a Facebook executive told the paper.


We’ll let you in on a few things the Times left out: Lessin is not an engineer, but a Harvard social studies major and a former Bain consultant.

<p>Introduction: OK, here’s something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who’s famous for his innovative treatment for “phantom limb” pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . “Oh, my God!” the man began</p><p>2 0.94713652 <a title="1845-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-Improvements_to_Kindle_Version_of_BDA3.html">1993 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-Improvements to Kindle Version of BDA3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>same-blog 3 0.93781018 <a title="1845-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-07-Is_Felix_Salmon_wrong_on_free_TV%3F.html">1845 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-07-Is Felix Salmon wrong on free TV?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Salmon is dismissive of the claim that there are fifty million over-the-air television viewers:

 
The 50 million number, by the way, should not be considered particularly reliable: it’s Aereo’s guess as to the number of people who ever watch free-to-air TV, even if they mainly watch cable or satellite. (Maybe they have a hut somewhere with an old rabbit-ear TV in it.)
 

And he strongly suggests the number is not only smaller but shrinking. By comparison, here’s a story from the broadcasting news site TV News Check from June of last year (if anyone has more recent numbers please let me know):

 
According to new research by GfK Media, the number of Americans now relying solely on over-the-air (OTA) television reception increased to almost 54 million, up from 46 million just a year ago. The recently completed survey also found that the demographics of broadcast-only households skew towards younger adults, minorities and lower-income families.

<p>Introduction: 10. Out of a random sample of 100 Americans, zero report having ever held political office. From this information, give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have ever held political office.
 
 Solution to question 9 
 
From  yesterday :
  
9. Out of a population of 100 medical records, 40 are randomly sampled and then audited. 10 out of the 40 audits reveal fraud. From this information, give an estimate, standard error, and 95% confidence interval for the proportion of audits in the population with fraud.
  
Solution:  estimate is p.hat=10/40=0.25.  Se is sqrt(1-f)*sqrt(p.hat*(1-.hat)/n)=sqrt(1-0.4)*sqrt(0.25*0.75/40)=0.053.  95% interval is [0.25 +/- 2*0.053] = [0.14,0.36].</p><p>5 0.93165207 <a title="1845-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-15-Last_word_on_Mister_P_%28for_now%29.html">2062 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-15-Last word on Mister P (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>6 0.92471266 <a title="1845-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>

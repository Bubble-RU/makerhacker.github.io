So, I tried how well Anaface does on something that the arts world considers as one of gold standards of beauty – Michelangelo’s David.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser asks:
  
Trying to figure out what are some keywords to research for this problem I’m trying to solve. I need to estimate seasonality but without historical data. What I have are multiple time series of correlated metrics (think department store sales, movie receipts, 
etc.) but all of them for 52 weeks only. I’m thinking that if these metrics are all subject to some underlying seasonality, I should be able to estimate that without needing prior years data.
  
My reply:
 
Can I blog this and see if the hive mind responds?  I’m not an expert on this one.
 
My first thought is to fit an additive model including date effects, with some sort of spline on the date effects along with day-of-week effects, idiosyncratic date effects (July 4th, Christmas, etc.), and possible interactions.
 
Actually, I’d love to fit something like that in Stan, just to see how it turns out.  It could be a tangled mess but it could end up working really well!</p><p>3 0.10222253 <a title="2147-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>6 0.080549911 <a title="2147-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-04-My_talk_at_Hunter_College_on_Thurs.html">694 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-04-My talk at Hunter College on Thurs</a></p>

So, I tried how well Anaface does on something that the arts world considers as one of gold standards of beauty – Michelangelo’s David.

<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: Ruth Rosenholtz of the department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT writes:
  
 We mostly do  computational modeling of human vision.  We try to do on the one hand the sort of basic science that fits in the human vision community, while on the other hand developing predictive models which might actually lend insight into design.  


 Your talk  resonated with me in part because of  this paper  [Do Predictions of Visual Perception Aid Design?, by Ruth Rosenholtz, Amal Dorai, and Rosalind Freeman].  We went into our study thinking that people would like to have a quantitative tool to help analyze designs.  But what we concluded, somewhat anecdotally, was that its main use seemed to be as a conversation-starter, and a means of communicating ideas about the design.  And  the reason it seemed to work is that our visualizations were the right level of a “puzzle” — challenging enough to be a bit fun to work out.

<p>Introduction: Please answer the above question before reading on . . . 
   
I’m curious after reading Leif Nelson’s  report  that, based on research with Minah Jung, approximately 42% of the people they surveyed said they bought laundry detergent on their most recent trip to the store.  I’m stunned that the number is so high.  42%???  That’s almost half the time.  If we bought laundry detergent half the time we went to the store, our apartment would be stacked so full with the stuff, we wouldn’t be able to enter the door.
 
I think we buy laundry detergent . . . ummm, how often?  There are 40 of those little laundry packets in the box, we do laundry once a day, sometimes twice, let’s say 10 times a week, so this means we buy detergent about once every 4 weeks.  We go to the store, hmmm, about once a day, let’s say 5 times a week to put our guess on the conservative side.  So, 20 trips to the store for each purchase of detergent, that’s 5% of the time.
 
Compared to us, lots of people must (a) go to</p><p>5 0.65951651 <a title="2147-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-03-Is_0.05_too_strict_as_a_p-value_threshold%3F.html">446 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-03-Is 0.05 too strict as a p-value threshold?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seth sent along an article (not by him) from the psychology literature and wrote:
  
This is a good example of your complaint about statistical significance. The authors want to say that predictability of information determines how distracting something is and have two conditions that vary in predictability. One is significantly distracting, the other isn’t. But the two conditions are not significantly different from each other. So the two conditions are different more weakly than p = 0.05.


I don’t think the reviewers failed to notice this. They just thought it should be published anyway, is my guess.


To me, the interesting question is: where should the bar be? at p = 0.05? at p = 0.10? something else? How can we figure out where to put the bar?
  
I replied:
 
My quick answer is that we have to get away from .05 and .10 and move to something that takes into account prior information.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  defines  a Ddulite as follows:
  
A preference for higher tech solutions even in cases where lower tech alternatives have greater and more appropriate functionality; a person of ddulite tendencies.


Though Ddulites are the opposite of Luddites with respect to attitudes toward technology, they occupy more or less the same point with respect to functionality.
  
As a sometime Luddite myself (no cell phone, tv, microwave oven, etc.), I should in fairness point out the logic in favor of being a Ddulite.  Old technology is typically pretty stable; new technology is improving.  It can make sense to switch early (before the new technology actually performs better than the old) to get the benefits of being familiar with the new technology once it does take off.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.8891874 <a title="2147-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-25-Measuring_Beauty.html">2147 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-25-Measuring Beauty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Anaface analysis of Michelangelo’s David
 
 
I’ve come across  a paper  that was using “beauty” as one of the predictors. To measure beauty, the authors used  Anaface.com 
 
I don’t trust metrics without trying them on a gold standard first. So, I tried how well Anaface does on something that the arts world considers as one of gold standards of beauty – Michelangelo’s David. My annotation might be imperfect, but David only gets to be only a good 7: his nose is too narrow and his eyes are too close.
 
Of course, I applaud the use of interesting predictors in studies, and Anaface is a better tool than anything I’ve seen before, but maybe we need better metrics! What do you think?</p><p>5 0.8730697 <a title="2147-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-06-Twitteo_killed_the_bloggio_star_._._._Not%21.html">841 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-06-Twitteo killed the bloggio star . . .

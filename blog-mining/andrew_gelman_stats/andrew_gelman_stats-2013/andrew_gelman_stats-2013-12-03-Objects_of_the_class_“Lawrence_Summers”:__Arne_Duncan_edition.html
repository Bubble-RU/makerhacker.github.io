<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.

<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:
 
1.  Not enough bridge projects, huh?  I don’t believe it.  We’ve been hearing fo</p><p>4 0.19375713 <a title="2122-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>5 0.15099657 <a title="2122-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Domain_specificity%3A__Does_being_really_really_smart_or_really_really_rich_qualify_you_to_make_economic_policy%3F.html">45 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Domain specificity:  Does being really really smart or really really rich qualify you to make economic policy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s this idea called “domain specificity” that I learned from my sister many years ago:  it’s the idea that a skill might work in some domains but not others. For example, knowing (some) Spanish helps a bit with my French but it doesn’t do anything for my Chinese.  Traditionally in psychometrics, this sort of thing is studied using correlation–scores on various math tests are highly correlated with each other, and these are also correlated (but less so) with scores on English tests.  Michael Jordan would probably be good at just about any sport he tried (even if he couldn’t quite hit the curveball).  Top actors can typically sing, dance, do magic, etc.–they’re great all-around performers.  And so on.
 
I was reminded of domain specificity after reading a  blog  by Felix Salmon arguing that Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers made big mistakes when they served as Treasury Secretaries during the Clinton administration.  Salmon writes:

<p>Introduction: Last month I  expressed disagreement  the following statement from New Republic columnist Jonathan Chait, who wrote:
  
The old liberal slogan always demanded that we “treat teachers like professionals.” That entails some measure of accountability—we can debate the metrics—which allows both that very bad teachers be fired and that very good ones can obtain greater pay and recognition. That’s the definition of a professional career track . . .
  
I was surprised to find the option of being fired as part of the definition of professionalism, and I conjectured that journalists, who currently have  little job security  could feel resentful toward teachers and other workers who have the expectation of jobs for life.  (As Mark Palko  notes , “we’re talking about reneging on assurances of job security that were contractual agreed upon and came after a period of proven performance.”)
 
In an update ( link  from Palko), Chait  writes :

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  passes  this  one  along from high school principal Carol Burris:
  
My music teacher, Doreen, brought me her second-grade daughter’s math homework.  She was already fuming over  Education Secretary Arne Duncan ’s remark about why “white suburban moms” oppose the Common Core, and the homework added fuel to the fire. The problem that disturbed her the most was the following:

 
3. Sally did some counting. Look at her work. Explain why you think Sally counted this way.


177, 178, 179, 180, 190, 200, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214.
 

It was on a homework sheet from the New York State Common Core Mathematics Curriculum for Grade 2,  which you can find here . 
Doreen’s daughter had no idea how to answer this odd question.
  
I’m with Doreen’s daughter on this one.  Actually, it’s worse than that.  I clicked on the link, searched on *Sally* to check that the problem was really there as stated, then I looked at the two previous problems:

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.

<p>Introduction: Jenny Anderson  reports  on a discussion of the practice of colleges preferential admission of children of alumni:
  
 
[Richard] Kahlenberg citing research from his book “Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions” made the case that getting into good schools matters — 12 institutions making up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population produced 42 percent of government leaders and 54 percent of corporate leaders.


And being a legacy helps improve an applicant’s chances of getting in, with one study finding that being a primary legacy — the son or daughter of an undergraduate alumnus or alumna — increases one’s chance of admission by 45.1 percent.
 

 
I’d call that 45 percent but I get the basic idea.
 
But then Jeffrey Brenzel of the Yale admissions office replied:
  
“We turn away 80 percent of our legacies, and we feel it every day,” Mr. Brenzel said, adding that he rejected more offspring of the school’s Sterling donors than he accepted this year (</p><p>6 0.72979432 <a title="2122-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-09-I_hate_polynomials.html">2365 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-09-I hate polynomials</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We have a new “ Objects of the class ,” and it’s a good one!
 
Here’s what happened.  I came across a thoughtful  discussion  by Mark Palko of how it was that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ticked off so many people with his recent remarks about “white suburban moms”:
  
To understand why Duncan hit such a nerve, you need to consider the long and complicated role that racial politics have played in this debate.


The public face of the education reform movement has always been pictures of eager young African-American and Hispanic children. Not only has the movement been sold as a way of helping these children but people who object to parts of the reform agenda have often been accused, implicitly or explicitly, of not wanting to help children of color. . . . For starters, with certain notable exceptions, the leaders of the reform movement tend to be white or Asian . . . By comparison, the tenured and/or unionized teachers who have paid the highest price in terms of policy changes an</p><p>2 0.95143223 <a title="2122-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-29-Roth_and_Amsterdam.html">57 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-29-Roth and Amsterdam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I used to think that fiction is about making up stories, but in recent years I’ve decided that fiction is really more of a method of telling true stories.  One thing fiction allows you to do is explore what-if scenarios.  I recently read two books that made me think about this:  The Counterlife by Philip Roth and Things We Didn’t See Coming by Steven Amsterdam.  Both books are explicitly about contingencies and possibilities:  Roth’s tells a sequence of related but contradictory stories involving his Philip Roth-like (of course) protagonist, and Amsterdam’s is based on an alternative present/future.  (I picture Amsterdam’s book as being set in Australia, but maybe I’m just imagining this based on my knowledge that the book was written and published in that country.)  I found both books fascinating, partly because of the characters’ voices but especially because they both seemed to exemplify George Box’s dictum that to understand a system you have to perturb it.

<p>Introduction: Anthony Goldbloom from Kaggle  writes :
  
We’ve recently put up some interesting new competitions. Last week, Jeff Sonas, the creator of the Chessmetrics rating system,  launched a competition  to find a chess rating algorithm that performs better than the official Elo system. Already  nine teams  have created systems that make more accurate predictions than Elo. It’s not a surprise that Elo has been outdone – the system was invented half a century ago before we could easily crunch large amounts of historical data. However, it is a big surprise that Elo has been outperformed so quickly given that it is the product of many years’ work (at least it was a surprise to me).

<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.
 
2.  Subtract points for taking the SAT multiple times.  A simple rule would be:  You can use your highest SAT score, but you lose 50 points for every other time</p><p>5 0.94773108 <a title="2122-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-05-The_greatest_works_of_statistics_never_published.html">128 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-05-The greatest works of statistics never published</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I came across a paper that referred to Charlie Geyer’s 1991 paper, “Estimating Normalizing Constants and Reweighting Mixtures in Markov Chain Monte Carlo.”  I expect that part or all of this influential article was included in some published paper, but I only know it as a technical report–which at the time of this writing has been  cited  an impressive 78 times!
 
This made me wonder:  what are the most influential contributions to statistics that were never published (not counting posthumous publication or decades-later reprints in compilation volumes).
 
Here’s all that I can think of:
 
- Thomas Bayes’s original article, published only in 1763, two years after his death.
 
- John Tukey’s legendary manuscript on multiple comparisons from the 1950s.  I actually think Tukey’s work on multiple comparisons was horribly illogical stuff, very clever but also bad bad bad, and I’m very happy that he moved on to other things.  But I can’t deny that his unpublished multiple compa</p><p>6 0.94726181 <a title="2122-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Science%2C_ideology%2C_and_human_origins.html">483 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Science, ideology, and human origins</a></p>

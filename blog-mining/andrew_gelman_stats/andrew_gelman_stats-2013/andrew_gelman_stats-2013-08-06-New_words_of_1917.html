<p>Introduction: Anna Lena Phillips  writes :
  
I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.


VIII. If you want to share a copy of this image, please ask first. If you want a real copy, you can ask about that too.

 This  report claims that eating meat increases the risk of cancer.  I’m sure you can’t read the page but you probably can understand the graphs. Different bars represent subdivision in the amount of the particular type of meat one consumes. And each chunk is different types of meat. Left is for male right is for female.


They claim that the difference is significant, but they are clearly not!!


I’m for not eating much meat but this is just way too much…
  
Here’s the graph:
 
   
 
I don’t know what to think.  If you look carefully you can find one or two statistically significant differences but overall the pattern doesn’t look so compelling.  I don’t know what the top and bottom rows are, though.  Overall, the pattern in the top row looks like it could represent a real trend, while the graphs on the bottom row look like noise.

<p>Introduction: Psychology researcher Chris Chabris  writes :
  
Rolf Dobelli, a Swiss writer, published a book called The Art of Thinking Clearly earlier this year with HarperCollins in the U.S. The book’s original German edition was a #1 bestseller, and the book has sold over one million copies worldwide.


In perusing Mr. Dobelli’s book, we noticed several familiar-sounding passages. On closer examination, we found five instances of unattributed material that is either reproduced verbatim or closely paraphrased from text and arguments in our book, The Invisible Gorilla (Crown, 2010). They are listed at the end of this note.
  
Apparently he ripped off Nassim Taleb  too .
 
A million copies, huh?  I guess crime really does pay!  Maybe he could get an appointment at  Harvard Law School  or, if that falls through, a position as writer-in-residence at the statistics department of George Mason University [no link needed for that one -- ed.].

<p>Introduction: This was an good idea:  take a bunch of old (and some recent) news articles on developments in mathematics and related ares from the past hundred years.  Fun for the math content and historical/nostalgia value.  Relive the four-color theorem, Fermat, fractals, and early computing.
 
I have too much of a technical bent to be the ideal reader for this sort of book, but it seems like an excellent gift for a non-technical reader who nonetheless enjoys math.  (I assume that such people are out there, just as there are people like me who canâ&euro;&trade;t read music but still enjoy reading about the subject.)
 
The book is organized by topic.  My own preference would have been chronological and with more old stuff.  I particularly enjoyed the material from many decades ago, such as the news report on one of the early computers.  This must have been a fun book to compile.</p><p>3 0.81296408 <a title="1970-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-Whassup_with_those_crappy_thrillers%3F.html">115 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-Whassup with those crappy thrillers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was stunned  this  from Jenny Davidson about mystery writers:
  
The crime fiction community is smart and adult and welcoming, and so many good books are being written (Lee Child was mentioning his peer group – i.e. they were the new kids around the same tie – being Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman – the list speaks for itself) . . .
  
Why was I stunned?  Because just a few days earlier I had a look at a book by Robert Crais.  It just happened that Phil, when he was visiting, had finished this book (which he described as “pretty good”) and left it with me so he wouldn’t have to take it back with him.  I’d never heard of Crais, but it had pretty amazing blurbs on the cover and Phil recommended it, so I took a look.
 
It was bad.  From page 1 it was bad.  It was like a bad cop show.  I could see the seams where the sentences were stitched together.  I could see how  somebody  might like this sort of book, but I certainly can’t understand the blurbs or the i</p><p>4 0.79909497 <a title="1970-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-28-New_book_by_Stef_van_Buuren_on_missing-data_imputation_looks_really_good%21.html">1642 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-28-New book by Stef van Buuren on missing-data imputation looks really good!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben points us to a new book,  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data .  It’s excellent and I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth the $89.95.  Van Buuren’s book is great even if you don’t end up using the algorithm described in the book (I actually like their approach but I do think there are some limitations with their particular implementation, which is one reason we’re developing our own  package ); he supplies lots of intuition, examples, and graphs. 
   
P.S.  Stef’s book features an introduction by Don Rubin, which gets me thinking:  if Don can find the time to write an introduction to somebody else’s book, he surely should be willing to read and comment on the third edition of his own book, no?</p><p>5 0.79793072 <a title="1970-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-12-Things_that_I_like_that_almost_nobody_else_is_interested_in.html">2168 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-12-Things that I like that almost nobody else is interested in</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  post by Jordan Ellenberg (“Stoner represents a certain strain in the mid-century American novel that I really like, and which I don’t think exists in contemporary fiction.  Anguish, verbal restraint, weirdness”) reminds me that what I really like is mid-to-late-twentieth-century  literary criticism .  I read a great book from the 50s, I think it was, by Anthony West (son of Rebecca West and H. G. Wells), who reviewed books for the New Yorker.  It was great, and it made me wish that other collections of his reviews had been published (they hadn’t). I’d also love to read collections of  Alfred Kazin ‘s reviews (there are some collections, but he published many many others that have never been reprinted) and others of that vintage.  I’m pretty sure these hypothetical books wouldn’t sell many copies, though. (I feel lucky, though, that at one point a publisher released a pretty fat collection of  Anthony Burgess ‘s book reviews.) It’s actually scary to think that many many more peopl</p><p>6 0.79015404 <a title="1970-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-30-%E2%80%9CStatistical_Modeling%3A__A_Fresh_Approach%E2%80%9D.html">1782 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-30-“Statistical Modeling:  A Fresh Approach”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I happened to come across a little book, “Current Glossary:  Words Coined Since the War.”  Here are some of them:
 
as’pi-rin, n.  A white compound used as a drug in the cure of headaches and rheumatism.
 
bob’go, n.  A kind of antelope in Africa; its meat is good for food.
 
cat’ta-lo, n.  A cross between an American bison and a cow.
 
dart, n.  A short, pointed spear-like weapon of steel dropped by airmen in attacks on the enemy.
 
free’lance, n.  A rover in literature, a writer not in the employ of one firm.
 
griz’zly bear.  A new kind of dance.
 
You get the idea.
 
P.S.  Some more literary nostalgia from the archives:

<p>Introduction: Edward Wyatt  reports :
  
Now the Obama administration is cracking down on what many call  patent trolls , shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid . . . “The United States patent system is vital for our economic growth, job creation, and technological advance,” [Senator] Leahy said in a statement. “Unfortunately, misuse of low-quality patents through patent trolling has tarnished the system’s image.”
  
There is some opposition:
  
But some big software companies, including Microsoft, expressed dismay at some of the proposals, saying they could themselves stifle innovation.
  
Microsoft . . . patent trolls . . . hmmm, where have we heard this connection  before ?
 
There is also some support for the bill:

<p>Introduction: From “Judge Savage,” by Tim Parks:
  
That evening, Daniel called Hilary’s parents.  These people always disliked me, he knew.  He had never understood if it was a racial thing, or whether they would have disliked any partner of Hilary’s.
  
Very clever.  Parks demonstrates Daniel’s blind spot–he can’t imagine that maybe Hilary’s parents hate him because of his unpleasant personality–but does it entirely from Daniel’s perspective.  I wonder if this just came naturally to Parks, or whether he figured it out as a puzzle to solve–how to convey a blind spot from the perspective of the person looking and not noticing it–or whether Parks wasn’t thinking at all about this and it just happened.
 
Considering the character Daniel’s psychology, I’d consider the above as an example of the so-called fundamental attribution error, in that he’s attributing Hilary’s parents dislike of him to situational factors rather than to his own personality.
 
I’ll have more on “Judge Savage” later (on the topic</p><p>4 0.57577431 <a title="1970-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-09-The_anti-Bayesian_moment_and_its_passing.html">1571 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-09-The anti-Bayesian moment and its passing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xian and I respond to the four discussants of our paper, “Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference.”  Here’s the abstract of  our rejoinder :
  
Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood. The present article arose from our memory of a particularly intemperate anti-Bayesian statement that appeared in Feller’s beautiful and classic book on probability theory. We felt that it was worth exploring the very extremeness of Feller’s words, along with similar anti-Bayesian remarks by others, in order to better understand the background underlying contr</p><p>5 0.57479674 <a title="1970-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-25-Great_graphs_of_names.html">2038 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-25-Great graphs of names</a></p>

Offhand, the only suggestions I have are to scale the graphs or indicate in some way the trends in the total popularity of each name (as it is, I wonder if some of the variation is arising from rarity), also to me the girl color looks a bit orangish and I’d go for something more purely pink.

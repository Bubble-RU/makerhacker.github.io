<p>Introduction: There is a lot of data on the web, meant to be looked at by people, but how do you turn it into a spreadsheet people could actually  analyze  statistically? 
 
The technique to turn web pages intended for people into structured data sets intended for computers is called “screen scraping.” It has just been made easier with a wiki/community  http://scraperwiki.com/ . 
 
They provide libraries to extract information from PDF, Excel files, to automatically fill in forms and similar. Moreover, the community aspect of it should allow researchers doing similar things to get connected. It’s very good. Here’s an example of scraping  road accident data  or  port of London ship arrivals .
 
You can already find collections of structured data online, examples are  Infochimps  (“find the world’s data”), and  Freebase  (“An entity graph of people, places and things, built by a community that loves open data.”).

“workspace” 
“tagging” 
“data exhaust”

I’m with  Zipfian Academy  – we’re launching next week as the first 12-week immersive program to teach data science. The program combines the hard and soft skills of data science with introductions to the data science community out here in San Francisco.


The launch will be covered by a couple big tech blogs, but we’d love to offer the opportunity to blog about it to some smaller and well-respected data science blogs like yours. 
  
I don’t know anything about this but I took a look at the website and it looks pretty cool.

 We launched Openpaths  the other week.  It’s a site where people can privately upload and view their iPhone location data (at least until an Apple update wipes it out) and also download their data for their own use.  More than just giving people a neat tool to view their data with, however, we’re also creating an option for them to donate their data to research projects at varying levels of anonymity.  We’re still working out the terms for that, but we’d love any input and to get in touch with anyone who might want to use the data.
  
I don’t have any use for this personally but maybe it will interest some of you.

Openpaths is an anonymous, user-contributed database for the personal location data files recorded by iOS devices. Users securely store, explore, and manage their personal location data, and grant researchers access to portions of that data as they choose.

<p>Introduction: When Sonia Sotomayor was nominated for the Supreme Court, and there was some discussion of having 6 Roman Catholics on the court at the same time, I  posted  the following historical graph:
 
 
 
It’s time for an update:
 
 
 
It’s still gonna take awhile for the Catholics to catch up. . . .
 
And this one might be relevant too:
 
 
 
It looks as if Jews and men have been overrepresented, also  Episcopalians  (which, as I noted earlier, are not necessarily considered Protestant in terms of religious doctrine but which I counted as such for the ethnic categorization).  Religion is an interesting political variable because it’s nominally about religious belief but typically seems to be more about ethnicity.</p><p>3 0.92627984 <a title="1853-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-01-A_randomized_trial_of_the_set-point_diet.html">1239 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-01-A randomized trial of the set-point diet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).


 Design:  Randomized clinica</p><p>4 0.90622616 <a title="1853-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-18-Prison_terms_for_financial_fraud%3F.html">420 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-18-Prison terms for financial fraud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My econ dept colleague Joseph Stiglitz  suggests  that financial fraudsters be sent to prison.  He points out that the usual penalty–million-dollar fines–just isn’t enough for crimes whose rewards can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
That all makes sense, but why do the options have to be:
 
1.  No punishment
 
2.  A fine with little punishment or deterrent value
 
3.  Prison. 
 
What’s the point of putting nonviolent criminals in prison?  As I’ve said  before , I’d prefer if the government just took all these convicted thieves’ assets along with 95% of their salary for several years, made them do community service (sorting bottles and cans at the local dump, perhaps; a financier should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc. If restriction of personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, they could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if you are ever more than 3 miles from your home.  And a curfew so you have to stay home bet</p><p>same-blog 5 0.90386152 <a title="1853-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-12-OpenData_Latinoamerica.html">1853 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-12-OpenData Latinoamerica</a></p>

Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching OpenDataLatinoamerica.org, a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.


We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain. Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight International Journalism Fellows.


If you work in Latin America or Central America your organization can take part in OpenDataLatinoamerica.org.

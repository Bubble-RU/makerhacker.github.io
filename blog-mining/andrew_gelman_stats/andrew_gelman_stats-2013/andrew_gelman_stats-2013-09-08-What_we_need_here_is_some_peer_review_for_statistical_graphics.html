<p>Introduction: I’m postponing today’s scheduled post (“Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models”) to continue the lively discussion from yesterday,  What if I were to stop publishing in journals? . 
   
 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.  The second paper, in particular, took some effort to place; I got some advice from colleagues in sociology as to where</p><p>3 0.14647283 <a title="2013-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Jelte_Wicherts_lays_down_the_stats_on_IQ.html">6 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Jelte Wicherts lays down the stats on IQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For background, you can start by reading my recent article,  Is It Possible to Be an Ethicist Without Being Mean to People?  and then a blog post,  Quality over Quantity , by John Cook, who writes:
  
At one point [Ed] Tufte spoke more generally and more personally about pursuing quality over quantity. He said most papers are not worth reading and that he learned early on to concentrate on the great papers, maybe one in 500, that are worth reading and rereading rather than trying to “keep up with the literature.” He also explained how over time he has concentrated more on showcasing excellent work than on criticizing bad work. You can see this in the progression from his first book to his latest. (Criticizing bad work is important too, but you’ll have to read his early books to find more of that. He won’t spend as much time talking about it in his course.) That reminded me of Jesse Robbins’ line: “Don’t fight stupid. You are better than that. Make more awesome.”
  
This made me stop an</p><p>5 0.13380736 <a title="2013-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>6 0.12710522 <a title="2013-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-31-A_data_visualization_manifesto.html">61 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-31-A data visualization manifesto</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In his  review  in 1938 of  Historical Development of the Graphical Representation of Statistical Data , by H. Gray Funkhauser, for  The Economic Journal , the great economist writes:
  
Perhaps the most striking outcome of Mr. Funkhouser’s researches is the fact of the very slow progress which graphical methods made until quite recently. . . . In the first fifty volumes of the Statistical Journal, 1837-87, only fourteen graphs are printed altogether. It is surprising to be told that Laplace never drew a graph of the normal law of error . . . Edgeworth made no use of statistical charts as distinct from mathematical diagrams.


Apart from Quetelet and Jevons, the most important influences were probably those of Galton and of Mulhall’s Dictionary, first published in 1884. Galton was indeed following his father and grandfather in this field, but his pioneer work was mainly restricted to meteorological maps, and he did not contribute to the development of the graphical representation of ec</p><p>3 0.73357445 <a title="2013-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-13-An_Economist%E2%80%99s_Guide_to_Visualizing_Data.html">2246 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-13-An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stephen Jenkins wrote:
  
I was thinking that you and your blog readers might be interested in “ An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data ” by Jonathan Schwabish, in the most recent Journal of Economic Perspectives (which is the American Economic Association’s main “outreach” journal in some ways).
  
I replied:
  
Ooh, I hate this so much!  This seems to represent a horrible example of economists not recognizing that outsiders can help them.  We do much much better in political science.
  
To which Jenkins wrote:
  
Ha! I guessed as much — hence sent it. And I’ll now admit I was surprised that JEP took the piece without getting Schwabisch to widen his reference points.
  
To elaborate a bit:  I agree with Schwabish’s general advice (“show the data,” “reduce the clutter,” and “integrate the text and the graph”).  But then he illustrates with 8 before-and-after stories in which he shows an existing graph and then gives his improvements.

<p>Introduction: Following  my talk  on infovis and statistical graphics at the  Empirical Legal Studies conference , Dan Kahan writes:
  
The legal academy, which is making strides toward sensible integration of a variety of empirical methods into its scholarship, is horribly ignorant of the utility of graphic reporting of data, a likely influence of the formative influence that econometric methods has exerted on expectations and habits of mind among legal scholars. Lee Epstein has written a pair of wonderful articles on graphic reporting –

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll pointed me to a  discussion  on the orgtheory blog in which Jerry Davis, the editor of a journal of business management argued that it is difficult for academic researchers to communicate with the public because “the public prefers Cheetos to a healthy salad” and when serious papers are discussed on the internet, “everyone is a methodologist.” The discussion heated up when an actual methodologist, Steve Morgan, joined in to argue that the salad in question was not so healthy and that the much-derided internet commenters made some valuable points. The final twist was that one of the orgtheory bloggers deleted a comment and then closed the thread entirely when the discussion got too conflictual.
 
In a few days I’ll return to the meta-topic of the discussion, but right now I want to focus on one thing Davis wrote, a particular statement that illustrates to me the gap between the rhetorical and the literal, the way in which a statement can sound good but make no sense.

<p>Introduction: Under the heading, “Bad graph candidate,” Kevin Wright points to  this article  [link fixed], writing:
  
Some of the figures use the same line type for two different series.


More egregious are the confidence intervals that are constant width instead of increasing in width into the future.
  
Indeed.  What’s even more embarrassing is that these graphs appeared in an article in the magazine Significance, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society.  
 
Perhaps every scientific journal could have a graphics editor whose job is to point out really horrible problems and require authors to make improvements.
 
The difficulty, as always, is that scientists write these articles for free and as a public service (publishing in Significance doesn’t pay, nor does it count as a publication in an academic record), so it might be difficult to get authors to fix their graphs.  On the other hand, if an article is worth writing at all, it’s worth trying to conv</p><p>2 0.96244895 <a title="2013-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-13-An_Economist%E2%80%99s_Guide_to_Visualizing_Data.html">2246 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-13-An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data</a></p>

I was thinking that you and your blog readers might be interested in “ An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data ” by Jonathan Schwabish, in the most recent Journal of Economic Perspectives (which is the American Economic Association’s main “outreach” journal in some ways).
  
I replied:
  
Ooh, I hate this so much!  This seems to represent a horrible example of economists not recognizing that outsiders can help them.  We do much much better in political science.
  
To which Jenkins wrote:
  
Ha! I guessed as much — hence sent it. And I’ll now admit I was surprised that JEP took the piece without getting Schwabisch to widen his reference points.
  
To elaborate a bit:  I agree with Schwabish’s general advice (“show the data,” “reduce the clutter,” and “integrate the text and the graph”).  But then he illustrates with 8 before-and-after stories in which he shows an existing graph and then gives his improvements.  My problem is that I don’t like most of his “afte</p><p>3 0.95197189 <a title="2013-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-02-Roads%2C_traffic%2C_and_the_importance_in_decision_analysis_of_carefully_examining_your_goals.html">988 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-02-Roads, traffic, and the importance in decision analysis of carefully examining your goals</a></p>

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.  Sure, traffic congestion is annoying, but there must be some advantages to driving on that crowded road or pe</p><p>4 0.95153427 <a title="2013-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-01-Ratios_where_the_numerator_and_denominator_both_change_signs.html">248 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-01-Ratios where the numerator and denominator both change signs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, I used a question by Benjamin Kay as  an excuse  to write that it’s usually a bad idea to study a ratio whose denominator has uncertain sign.  As I wrote then:
  
Similar problems arise with marginal cost-benefit ratios, LD50 in logistic regression (see chapter 3 of Bayesian Data Analysis for an example), instrumental variables, and the Fieller-Creasy problem in theoretical statistics. . . . In general, the story is that the ratio completely changes in interpretation when the denominator changes sign.
  
More recently, Kay sent in a related question:
  
 
I [Kay] wondered if you have any advice on handling ratios when the signs change as a result of a parameter.


I have three functions, one C * x^a, another D * x^a, and a third f(x,a) in my paper such that:


C * x^a, < f(x,a) < D * x^a


C,D and a all have the same signs. 
We can divide through by C * x^a but the results depend on the sign of C either


1< f(x,a) /  C * x^a < D * x^a /  C * x^a,


or

<p>Introduction: Charlie Saunders writes:
  
A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?

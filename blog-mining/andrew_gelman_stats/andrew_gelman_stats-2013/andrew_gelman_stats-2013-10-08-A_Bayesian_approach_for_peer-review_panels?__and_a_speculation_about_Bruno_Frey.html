</p><p>8 I haven’t read Sgroi and Oswald’s paper in detail, but I will comment on its general approach. [sent-13, score-0.2]
</p><p>9 Here’s how they put it:    Our later proposal boils down to a rather intuitive idea. [sent-14, score-0.17]
</p><p>10 It is that of using citations gradually to update an initial estimate (the Prior) of a journal article’s quality to form instead a considered, more informed estimate (the Posterior) of its quality. [sent-15, score-0.599]
</p><p>11 3 The simplest possible way to model this intention is to think in terms of a simple binary partitioning of the state space. [sent-18, score-0.237]
</p><p>12 Essentially, either a paper submitted to the REF is considered to be making an outstanding contribution or not. [sent-19, score-0.476]
</p><p>13 On that basis we can specify the state space to be ω ∈ Ω = {a, b} where “a” is taken to mean “making an outstanding contribution to setting agendas” and “b” is taken to mean “not doing so”. [sent-20, score-0.267]
</p><p>14 Following the more general theoretical literature on testing and evaluation, such as Gill and Sgroi (2008, 2012), a Bayesian model in this context is simply one that produces a posterior probability, p_i, that a given submitted paper indexed by i is of type a rather than type b. [sent-21, score-0.495]
</p><p>15 To the extent that citations are measuring quality or impact, I think that the underlying quantity (as well as its measures) have to be continuous. [sent-23, score-0.567]
</p><p>16 It doesn’t make sense to me to characterize papers as type a or type b. [sent-24, score-0.22]

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this letter  to Bruno Frey from the editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.  ( Background here , also  more here  from Olaf Storbeck.)  The journal editor was upset about Frey’s self-plagiarism, and Frey responded with an apology:
  
It was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable. . . . Please be assured that we take all precautions and measures that this unfortunate event does not happen again, with any journal.
  
What I wonder is:  How “deplorable” does Frey really think this is?  You don’t publish a paper in 5 different places by accident!  Is Frey saying that he knew this was deplorable back then and he did it anyway, based on calculation balancing the gains from multiple publications vs. the potential losses if he got caught?  Or is he saying that the conduct is deplorable, but he didn’t realize it was deplorable when he did it?

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.14741296 <a title="2055-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-26-Musical_chairs_in_econ_journals.html">371 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-26-Musical chairs in econ journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>5 0.14362593 <a title="2055-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>3 0.84374183 <a title="2055-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-I_posted_this_as_a_comment_on_a_sociology_blog.html">2353 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-I posted this as a comment on a sociology blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>4 0.83922756 <a title="2055-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-Arrow%E2%80%99s_theorem_update.html">883 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-Arrow’s theorem update</a></p>

This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>6 0.83598518 <a title="2055-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-20-%E2%80%9CI_know_you_aren%E2%80%99t_the_plagiarism_police%2C_but_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">1585 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-20-“I know you aren’t the plagiarism police, but . . .”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Daniel Sgroi and Andrew Oswald  write :
  
Many governments wish to assess the quality of their universities. A prominent example is the UK’s new Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014. In the REF, peer-review panels will be provided with information on publications and citations. This paper suggests a way in which panels could choose the weights to attach to these two indicators. The analysis draws in an intuitive way on the concept of Bayesian updating (where citations gradually reveal information about the initially imperfectly-observed importance of the research). Our study should not be interpreted as the argument that only mechanistic measures ought to be used in a REF.
  
I agree that, if you’re going to choose a weighted average, it makes sense to think about where the weights are coming from.  Some aspects of Sgroi and Oswald’s proposal remind me of the old idea of evaluating journal articles by expected number of total citations.  The idea is that you’d use four pieces of i</p><p>2 0.95255685 <a title="2055-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-Question_26_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1367 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-Question 26 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>4 0.94955391 <a title="2055-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-31-Type_S_error_rates_for_classical_and_Bayesian_single_and_multiple_comparison_procedures.html">494 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-31-Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian single and multiple comparison procedures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reported  on someone who wanted to insert text links into the blog.  I asked her how much they would pay and got no answer.
 
Yesterday, though, I received this reply:
  
Hello Andrew,


I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I’d like to make a proposal for your site. Please refer below.


We would like to place a simple text link ad on page http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/  to link to *** with the key phrase ***.


We will incorporate the key phrase into a sentence so it would read well. Rest assured it won’t sound obnoxious or advertorial. We will then process the final text link code as soon as you agree to our proposal. 


We can offer you $200 for this with the assumption that you will keep the link “live” on that page for 12 months or longer if you prefer.


Please get back to us with a quick reply on your thoughts on this and include your Paypal ID for payment process.  Hoping for a positive response from you.

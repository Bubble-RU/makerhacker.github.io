<p>Introduction: Within any education category, richer people vote more Republican. In contrast, the pattern of education and voting is nonlinear. High school graduates are more Republican than non-HS grads, but after that, the groups with more education tend to vote more Democratic. At the very highest education level tabulated in the survey, voters with post-graduate degrees lean toward the Democrats. Except for the rich post-graduates; they are split 50-50 between the parties.
 
What does this say about America’s elites? If you define elites as high-income non-Hispanic whites, the elites vote strongly Republican. If you define elites as college-educated high-income whites, they vote moderately Republican.
 
There is no plausible way based on these data in which elites can be considered a Democratic voting bloc. To create a group of strongly Democratic-leaning elite whites using these graphs, you would need to consider only postgraduates (no simple college grads included, even if they have achieved s</p><p>3 0.18157893 <a title="1795-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-02-Culture_clash.html">1836 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-02-Culture clash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had no idea this sort of thing even existed:
 
   
 
I’m reminded of our  discussion  of Charles Murray’s recent book on social divisions among Americans.  Murray talked about differences between upper and lower class, but I thought he was really talking more about differences between liberals and conservatives among the elite.  (More discussion  here .)
 
In this particular case, Murray’s story about irresponsible elites seems to fit pretty well.  At the elite level, you have well-connected D.C. gun lobbyists opposing any restrictions on personal weapons.  As Murray might put it, the elites (Phil Spector aside) may be able to handle their guns, but some lower-class Americans cannot—they do things like give real rifles to 5-year-olds (!).  As Murray writes, it’s a combination of cultural ignorance and a permissive ideology:  I assume the senators who voted against the recent gun control bill wouldn’t give live weapons to  their  kids (or live in neighborhoods in which kids have acces</p><p>4 0.1072519 <a title="1795-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

<p>Introduction: The other day I posted  some comments  on the voting patterns of rich and poor in the context of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart.”  My graphs on income and voting are just fine, but I mischaracterized Murray’s statements.  So I want to fix that right away.  After that I have some thoughts on the book itself.
 
In brief:
 
1. I was unfair to call him a Tucker Carlson.
 
2. Murray talks a lot about upper-class liberals. That’s fine but I think his discussion would be improved by also considering upper-class conservatives, given that I see the big culture war occurring within the upper class.
 
3. Using the case of Joe Paterno as an example, I discuss why Murray’s “preach what you practice” advice could be difficult to carry out in practice. 
   
 Murray on the top 5% 
 
David Frum  quoted  Murray as writing that the top 5% “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it.

<p>Introduction: Charles Murray wrote a much-discussed new book, “Coming Apart:  The State of White America, 1960-2010.”
 
David Frum  quotes  Murray as writing, in an echo of now-forgotten TV personality  Tucker Carlson , that the top 5% of incomes “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it.  Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”
 
[I’ve interjected a “perhaps” into the title of this blog post to indicate that I don’t have the exact Murray quote here so I’m relying on David Frum’s interpretation.]
 
Frum does me the favor of citing Red State Blue State as evidence, and I’d like to back this up with some graphs.
 
Frum writes:
  
Say “top 5%” to Murray, and his imagination conjures up everything he dislikes: coastal liberals listening to NPR in their Lexus hybrid SUVs. He sees that image so intensely that no mere number can force him to remember that the top 5% also includes the evangelical Christian assistant coach of a state university football team. . . .

<p>Introduction: As we said in Red State, Blue State, it’s not the Prius vs. the pickup truck, it’s the Prius vs. the Hummer.  Here’s the graph:
 
 
 
Or, as Ross Douthat put it in  an op-ed  yesterday:
  
This means that a culture war that’s often seen as a clash between liberal elites and a conservative middle America looks more and more like a conflict within the educated class — pitting Wheaton and Baylor against Brown and Bard, Redeemer Presbyterian Church against the 92nd Street Y, C. S. Lewis devotees against the Philip Pullman fan club.
  
Our main motivation for doing this work was to change how the news media think about America’s political divisions, and so it’s good to see our ideas getting mainstreamed and moving toward conventional wisdom.
  

 
P.S.  Here’s the time series of graphs showing how the pattern that we and Douthat noticed, of a battle between coastal states and middle America that is occurring among upper-income Americans, is relatively recent, having arisen in the Clinton ye</p><p>6 0.53257477 <a title="1795-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-25-Same_old_story.html">1229 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-25-Same old story</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I came across the following headline:
 
  
 Unemployment Extension Fails: Senate Rejects Jobless Benefits 58-38  
 

 
Actually, though, the Senate voted 58-38  in favor  of the bill.  But the opponents did a filibuster.  Here’s another try:
 
  
 Congress Fails to Pass an Extension of Jobless Aid  
 

 
But it’s still not clear that the vote was strongly in favor–not even close, in fact.  A better headline, I think, would be:
  
Senate Vote on Unemployment Extension:  58-38 in Favor, Not Enough to Beat Filibuster
  
Or maybe someone more journalistic than I can come up with something better?</p><p>6 0.33419168 <a title="1795-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-I_like_lineplots.html">800 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-I like lineplots</a></p>

I am using a multilevel model with three levels. I read that you wrote a book about multilevel models, and wonder if you can solve the following question.  


The data structure is like this:

Level two: companys (90 companies)

I use 6 level-three variables (i.e. industry characteristics) to explain the variance of the level-one effect across industries. The question here is whether there is an over-fitting problem since there are only 17 industries. I understand that this must be a problem for non-multilevel models, but is it also a problem for multilevel models?
  
My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.

<p>Introduction: People keep telling me that Sas isn’t as bad as everybody says, but then I see (from  Christian Robert ) this listing from the Sas website of “disadvantages in using Bayesian analysis”:
  
There is no correct way to choose a prior. Bayesian inferences require skills to translate prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior. If you do not proceed with caution, you can generate misleading results. . . . From a practical point of view, it might sometimes be difficult to convince subject matter experts who do not agree with the validity of the chosen prior.
  
That is so tacky! As if least squares, logistic regressions, Cox models, and all those other likelihoods mentioned in the Sas documentation are so automatically convincing to subject matter experts.
 
P.S.  For some more serious objections to Bayesian statistics, see  here  and  here .

The legal academy, which is making strides toward sensible integration of a variety of empirical methods into its scholarship, is horribly ignorant of the utility of graphic reporting of data, a likely influence of the formative influence that econometric methods has exerted on expectations and habits of mind among legal scholars. Lee Epstein has written a pair of wonderful articles on graphic reporting –

Just read  this  today and my unsophisticated statistical mind is confused.


“Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics.”


From my education about statistics, I remember to be suspicious about multiple regression coefficients that are in the opposite direction of the bivariate coefficients. What I am missing? I vaguely remember something about the suppression effect.
  
My reply:
 
There’s a long literature on this from many decades ago.  My general feeling about such situations is that, when the coefficient changes a lot after controlling for other variables, it is important to visualize this change, to understand what is the interaction among variables that is associated with the change in the coefficients.

I’m a media sociologist at the University of Houston.  I’ve been using HLM3 for about two years.  


Briefly about my data.  It’s a content analysis of news stories with a continuous scale dependent variable, story prominence.  I have 6090 news stories, 114 newspapers, and 59 newspaper group owners.  All the Level-1, Level-2 and dependent variables have been standardized. Since the means were zero anyway, we left the variables uncentered.  All the Level-3 ownership groups and characteristics are dichotomous scales that were left uncentered.  


PROBLEM:  The single most important result I am looking for is to compare the strength of nine competing Level-1 variables in their ability to predict and explain the outcome variable, story prominence.

I am seeing if the habitat or size of harvested mussels (Mytilus edulis) can be reconstructed from measurements of the umbo (the pointy end, and the only bit that survives well in archaeological deposits) using log-transformed measurements (or allometry; relationships between dimensions are more likely exponential than linear). 
Of course multivariate regressions in most statistics packages (Minitab, SPSS, SAS) assume you are trying to predict one variable from all the others (a Model I regression), and use ordinary least squares to fit the regression line. For organismal dimensions this makes little sense, since all the dimensions are (at least in theory) free to change their mutual proportions during growth.

I [Kahan] saw it at  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-100-year-march-of-technology-in-1-graph/255573/  , which misidentified the source (not “visual economics”;   visualizingeconomics   .com ,  which attributes it  to  Nicholas Felton , who apparently condensed  this version , which I worry could cause a stroke). But it did have a good write-up that (I’m glad) caught my attention.


It made me [Kahan] start to wonder about what sorts of qualities of a technology will influence its dissemination & also about the availability of benchmarks for proliferation of various sorts of things (e.g, fads & trends, health-promoting behaviors, knowledge of a scientific discovery) that one could use to gauge how meaningful the apparent increase in rates of proliferation of these technologies has been over time. That in turn made me wonder whether — indeed, suspect th</p><p>2 0.98353434 <a title="1815-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-27-Macromuddle.html">1347 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-27-Macromuddle</a></p>
<p>Introduction: More and more I feel like economics reporting is based on crude principles of adding up “good news” and “bad news.”  Sometimes this makes sense:  by almost any measure, an unemployment rate of 10% is bad news compared to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Other times, though, the good/bad news framework seems so tangled.
 
For example:  house prices up is considered good news but inflation is considered bad news.  A strong dollar is considered good news but it’s also an unfavorable exchange rate, which is bad news.  When facebook shares go down, that’s bad news, but if they automatically go up, that means they were underpriced which doesn’t seem so good either.  Pundits are torn between rooting for the euro to fail (which means our team (the U.S.) is better than Europe (their team)) and rooting for it to survive (because a collapse in Europe is bad news for the U.S. economy).  China’s economy doing well is bad news—but if their economy slips, that’s bad news too.

I am completing my doctoral dissertation dealing with modeling adverse birth outcomes.  The models are complex with 9 risk factors, 5 area level variables and 4 individual level variables.


I used hierarchical logistic regression (SAS glimmix) to analyze the data.


I am now faced with reporting the results.  Can you please recommend any references and/or examples that would suggest what results to report in what format?  I have found no references and scant examples of reporting such results in tables.
  
My reply:  I think graphs are the way to go.  I don’t have any immediate ideas beyond what’s in the book with Jennifer.  I think this is an important area of research.</p><p>4 0.97737288 <a title="1815-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-05-Against_double-blind_reviewing%3A__Political_science_and_statistics_are_not_like_biology_and_physics.html">601 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-05-Against double-blind reviewing:  Political science and statistics are not like biology and physics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to a proposal to move the journal Political Analysis from double-blind to single-blind reviewing (that is, authors would not know who is reviewing their papers but reviewers would know the authors’ names), Tom Palfrey writes:
  
I agree with the editors’ recommendation. I have served on quite a few editorial boards of journals with different blinding policies, and have seen no evidence that double blind procedures are a useful way to improve the quality of articles published in a journal. Aside from the obvious administrative nuisance and the fact that authorship anonymity is a thing of the past in our discipline, the theoretical and empirical arguments in both directions lead to an ambiguous conclusion. Also keep in mind that the editors know the identity of the authors (they need to know for practical reasons), their identity is not hidden from authors, and ultimately it is they who make the accept/reject decision, and also lobby their friends and colleagues to submit “the</p><p>5 0.97479683 <a title="1815-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-17-Bayes_pays.html">857 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-17-Bayes pays</a></p>

The Centre for Multilevel Modelling at the University of Bristol is seeking to appoint an applied statistician to work on a new ESRC-funded project, Longitudinal Effects, Multilevel Modelling and Applications (LEMMA 3). LEMMA 3 is one of six Nodes of the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). The LEMMA 3 Node will focus on methods for the analysis of longitudinal data.


The appointment, at Research Assistant or Research Associate level, will be for 2.5 years with likelihood of extension to the end of September 2014.

By “modelling,” I think he means “modeling.”  And by “centre,” I think he means “center.”  But I think you get the basic idea.

<p>Introduction: Arnaud Trolle (no  relation ) writes:
  
I have a question about the interpretation of (non-)overlapping of 95% credibility intervals. In a Bayesian ANOVA (a within-subjects one), I computed 95% credibility intervals about the main effects of a factor. I’d like to compare two by two the main effects across the different conditions of the factor. Can I directly interpret the (non-)overlapping of these credibility intervals and make the following statements: “As the 95% credibility intervals do not overlap, both conditions have significantly different main effects” or conversely “As the 95% credibility intervals overlap, the main effects of both conditions are not significantly different, i.e. equivalent”? 
I heard that, in the case of classical confidence intervals, the second statement is false, but what happens when working within a Bayesian framework?
  
My reply:
 
I think it makes more sense to directly look at inference for the difference.  Also, your statements about equivalence</p><p>4 0.15020201 <a title="1979-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-29-My_talk_in_Amsterdam_tomorrow_%28Wed_29_Oct%29%3A__Can_we_use_Bayesian_methods_to_resolve_the_current_crisis_of_statistically-significant_research_findings_that_don%E2%80%99t_hold_up%3F.html">2081 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-29-My talk in Amsterdam tomorrow (Wed 29 Oct):  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The talk  is at the University of Amsterdam in the Diamantbeurs (Weesperplein 4, Amsterdam), room 5.01, at noon.
 
Here’s the plan:
  
Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?


In recent years, psychology and medicine have been rocked by scandals of research fraud. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of serious flaws in the general practices of statistics for scientific research, to the extent that top journals routinely publish claims that are implausible and cannot be replicated. All this is occurring despite (or perhaps because of?) statistical tools such as Type 1 error control that are supposed to restrict the rate of unreliable claims. We consider ways in which prior information and Bayesian methods might help resolve these problems.
  
I don’t know how organized this talk will be. It combines a bunch of ideas that have been floating around recently. Here are a few recent articles that</p><p>5 0.10733984 <a title="1979-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-16-How_do_we_choose_our_default_methods%3F.html">1859 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-16-How do we choose our default methods?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was asked to write an article for the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) 50th anniversary volume.   Here it is  (it’s labeled as “Chapter 1,” which isn’t right; that’s just what came out when I used the template that was supplied).  The article begins as follows:
  
The field of statistics continues to be divided into competing schools of thought. In theory one might imagine choosing the uniquely best method for each problem as it arises, but in practice we choose for ourselves (and recom- mend to others) default principles, models, and methods to be used in a wide variety of settings. This article briefly considers the informal criteria we use to decide what methods to use and what principles to apply in statistics problems.
  
And then I follow up with these sections:

<p>Introduction: Statisticians take tours in other people’s data.
 
All methods of statistical inference rest on statistical models. Experiments typically have problems with compliance, measurement error, generalizability to the real world, and representativeness of the sample. Surveys typically have problems of undercoverage, nonresponse, and measurement error.
 
Real surveys are done to learn about the general population. But real surveys are not random samples. For another example, consider educational tests: what are they exactly measuring? Nobody knows. Medical research: even if it’s a randomized experiment, the participants in the study won’t be a random sample from the population for whom you’d recommend treatment. You don’t need random sampling to generalize the results of a medical experiment to the general population but you need some substantive theory to make the assumption that effects in your nonrepresentative sample of people will be similar to effects in the population of interest.

<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.

<p>Introduction: Keith O’Rourke and I wrote  an article  that begins:
  
Textbooks on statistics emphasize care and precision, via concepts such as reliability and validity in measurement, random sampling and treatment assignment in data collection, and causal identification and bias in estimation. But how do researchers decide what to believe and what to trust when choosing which statistical methods to use? How do they decide the credibility of methods? Statisticians and statistical practitioners seem to rely on a sense of anecdotal evidence based on personal experience and on the attitudes of trusted colleagues. Authorship, reputation, and past experience are thus central to decisions about statistical procedures.
  
It’s for a volume on theoretical or methodological research on authorship, functional roles, reputation, and credibility in social media, edited by Sorin Matei and Elisa Bertino.</p><p>2 0.90693557 <a title="1979-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-18-Those_mean_psychologists%2C_making_fun_of_dodgy_research%21.html">1329 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-18-Those mean psychologists, making fun of dodgy research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two people separately sent me  this amusing mock-research paper  by Brian A. Nosek (I assume that’s what’s meant by “Arina K. Bones”).  The article is pretty funny, but  this poster  (by Nosek and Samuel Gosling) is even better!  Check it out:
 
   
 
   
 
I remarked that this was almost as good as my zombies paper, and my correspondent pointed me to  this page  of (I assume) Nosek’s research on aliens.
 
P.S.  I clicked through to take  the test  to see if I’m dead or alive, but I got bored after a few minutes.  I gotta say, if Gosling can  come up with  a 10-item measure of the Big Five, this crew should be able to come up with a reasonably valid alive-or-dead test that doesn’t require dozens and dozens of questions!</p><p>3 0.89802718 <a title="1979-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-11-%E2%80%9CTiny%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CLarge%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CVery%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CNice%2C%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%9CDumbest%E2%80%9D.html">409 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-11-“Tiny,” “Large,” “Very,” “Nice,” “Dumbest”</a></p>

I am a recent M.A. graduate in sociology.  I am primarily qualitative in method but have been moving in a more mixed-methods direction ever since I discovered sports analytics (Moneyball, Football Outsiders, Wages of Wins, etc.).


For my thesis I studied Korean-Americans in education in the health professions through a comparison of Asian ethnic representation in Los Angeles-area medical and dental schools. 


I did this by counting up different Asian ethnic groups at UC Irvine, USC and Loma Linda University’s medical/dental schools using surnames as an identifier (I coded for ethnicity using an algorithm from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries which correlated surnames with ethnicity: http://www.naaccr.org/Research/DataAnalysisTools.aspx). The coding was mostly easy, since “Nguyen” and “Tran” is always Vietnamese, “Kim” and “Song” is Korean, “Shimazaki” is Japanese, etc.


Now, the first time around I found that Chinese-Americans and</p><p>5 0.86935419 <a title="1979-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-29-How_to_grab_power_in_a_democracy_%E2%80%93_in_5_easy_non-violent_steps.html">116 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-29-How to grab power in a democracy – in 5 easy non-violent steps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past decades violent means of grabbing power have been discredited and internationally regulated. Still, grabbing power is as desired as it has always been, and I’d like to introduce some new methods used today:
  
 Establish your base of power by achieving a critical mass (75%+) within a group with a  high barrier to entry . Examples of barriers to entry: genetics (familiar ties, skin, eye color, hair type – takes 2+ generations to enter), religion (takes 2-10 years to enter), language (very hard to enter after the age of 10). 
 Encourage your followers to have  many children  – because of common ethical concerns, other groups will help you bring them up. 
 Control the system of  indoctrination , such as religious schooling, government-based educational system, entertainment, popular culture – limiting the loss of children to out-group (only needed for non-genetic barriers to entry). 
  Wait 18 years  for your followers’ children to become eligible to vote. 
  Win elections  by</p><p>6 0.85888827 <a title="1979-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-30-%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_at_least_as_much_as_an_80_percent_chance_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">982 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-30-“There’s at least as much as an 80 percent chance . . .”</a></p>

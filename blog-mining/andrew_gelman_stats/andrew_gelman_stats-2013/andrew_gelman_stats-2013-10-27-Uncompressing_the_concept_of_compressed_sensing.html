<p>Introduction: Some asshole who has a bug up his ass about compressed sensing is spamming our  comments  with a bunch of sock puppets.  All from the same IP address:  “George Stoneriver,” Scott Wolfe,” and just plain “Paul,”  all saying pretty much the same thing in the same sort of broken English (except for Paul, whose post was too short to do a dialect analysis). “Scott Wolfe” is a generic sort of name, but a quick google search reveals nothing related to this topic. “George Stoneriver” seems to have no internet presence at all (besides the comments at this blog).  As for “Paul,” I don’t know, maybe the spammer was too lazy to invent a last name?
 
Our spammer spends about half his time slamming the field of compressed sensing and the other half pumping up the work of someone named Xiteng Liu.  There’s no excuse for this behavior.  It’s horrible, a true abuse of our scholarly community.
 
If Scott Adams wants to use a sock puppet, fine, the guy’s an artist and we should cut him some slack.

<p>Introduction: I pointed Xihong Lin to  this post  from last month regarding Hastie and Tibshirani’s “bet on sparsity principle.”  I argued that, in the worlds in which I work, in social and environmental science, every contrast is meaningful, even if not all of them can be distinguished from noise given a particular dataset.  That is, I claim that effects are dense but data can be sparse—and any apparent sparsity of effects is typically just an artifact of sparsity of data.
 
But things might be different in other fields.  Xihong had an interesting perspective in the application areas where she works:
  
Sparsity and density both appear in genetic studies too. For example, ethnicity has effects across millions of genetic variants across the genome (dense). Disease associated genetic variants are sparse.</p><p>6 0.097770326 <a title="2079-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-19-Index_or_indicator_variables.html">2296 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-19-Index or indicator variables</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
Did you know that it looks like Microsoft is entering the modeling game? I mean, outside of Excel. I recently received an email at work from a MS research contractor looking for ppl that program in R, SAS, Matlab, Excel, and Mathematica. . . . So far I [the person who sent me this email] haven’t seen anything about applying any actual models. Only stuff about assigning variables, deleting rows, merging tables, etc. I don’t know how common knowledge this all is within the statistical community. I did a quick google search for the name of the programming language and didn’t come up with anything.
  
That sounds cool.  Working with anything from Microsoft sounds pretty horrible, but it would be useful to have another modeling language out there, just for checking our answers if nothing else.</p><p>6 0.674281 <a title="2079-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-15-When_Does_a_Name_Become_Androgynous%3F.html">208 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-15-When Does a Name Become Androgynous?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
 These  compressed sensing people link to Shannon’s  advice .  It’s refreshing when leaders of a field state that their stuff may not be a panacea.
  
I replied:  Scarily enough, I don’t know anything about this research area at all!
 
My correspondent followed up:
  
Meh.  They proved L1 approximates L0 when design matrix is basically full rank. Now all sparsity stuff is sometimes called ‘compressed sensing’. Most of it seems to be linear interpolation, rebranded.
  
I wrote back:  But rebranding/reframing can be useful!  Often reframing is a step in the direction of improvement, of better understanding one’s assumptions and goals.</p><p>2 0.93516946 <a title="2079-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-12-Improvement_of_5_MPG%3A_how_many_more_auto_deaths%3F.html">708 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-12-Improvement of 5 MPG: how many more auto deaths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This entry was posted by Phil Price. 
 
	A colleague is looking at data on car (and SUV and light truck) collisions and casualties.  He’s interested in causal relationships.  For instance, suppose car manufacturers try to improve gas mileage without decreasing acceleration.  The most likely way they will do that is to make cars lighter.  But perhaps lighter cars are more dangerous; how many more people will die for each mpg increase in gas mileage?
 
	There are a few different data sources, all of them seriously deficient from the standpoint of answering this question.  Deaths are very well reported, so if someone dies in an auto accident you can find out what kind of car they were in, what other kinds of cars (if any) were involved in the accident, whether the person was a driver or passenger, and so on.  But it’s hard to normalize:  OK, I know that N people who were passengers in a particular model of car died in car accidents last year, but I don’t know how many passenger-miles that</p><p>3 0.92889881 <a title="2079-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-31-Editing_and_clutch_hitting.html">173 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-31-Editing and clutch hitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regarding  editing :  The only serious editing I’ve ever received has been for my New York Times op-eds and my article in the American Scientist.  My book editors have all been nice people, and they’ve helped me with many things (including suggestions of what my priorities should be in communicating with readers)–they’ve been great–but they’ve not given (nor have I expected or asked for) serious editing.  Maybe I should’ve asked for it, I don’t know.  I’ve had time-wasting experiences with copy editors and a particularly annoying experience with a production editor (who was so difficult that my coauthors and I actually contacted our agent and a lawyer about the possibility of getting out of our contract), but that’s another story.
 
Regarding  clutch hitting , Bill James once noted that it’s great when a Bucky Dent hits an unexpected home run, but what’s really special is being able to get the big hit when it’s expected of you.  The best players can do their best every time they come t</p><p>4 0.92821085 <a title="2079-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-28-Migrating_from_dot_to_underscore.html">1472 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-28-Migrating from dot to underscore</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My C-oriented Stan collaborators have convinced me to use underscore (_) rather than dot (.) as much as possible in expressions in R.  For example, I can name a variable n_years rather than n.years.  This is fine.  But I’m getting annoyed because I need to press the shift key every time I type the underscore.
 
What do people do about this?  I know that it’s easy enough to reassign keys (I could, for example, assign underscore to backslash, which I never use).  I’m just wondering what C programmers actually do.  Do they reassign the key or do they just get used to pressing Shift?
 
P.S.  In comments, Ben Hyde  points  to Google’s R style guide, which recommends that variable names use dots,  not  underscore or camel case, for variable names (for example, “avg.clicks” rather than “avg_Clicks” or “avgClicks”).  I think they’re recommending this to be consistent with  R coding conventions .
 
I am switching to underscores in R variable names to be consistent with C.  Otherwise we were run</p><p>5 0.92598784 <a title="2079-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-13-%243M_health_care_prediction_challenge.html">465 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-13-$3M health care prediction challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:
  
Participants in the Health Prize challenge will be given a data set comprised of the de-identified medical records of 100,000 individuals who are members of HPN.  The teams will then need to predict the hospitalization of a set percentage of those members who went to the hospital during the year following the start date, and do so with a defined accuracy rate.  The winners will receive the $3 million prize. . . . the contest is designed to spur involvement by others involved in analytics, such as those involved in data mining and predictive modeling who may not currently be working in health care.  “We believe that doing so will bring innovative thinking to health analytics and may allow us to solve at</p><p>6 0.92190158 <a title="2079-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-Super_Sam_Fuld_Needs_Your_Help_%28with_Foul_Ball_stats%29.html">802 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-Super Sam Fuld Needs Your Help (with Foul Ball stats)</a></p>

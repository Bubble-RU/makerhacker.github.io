[sent-7, score-0.44]
</p><p>2 But contrary to the prediction of SCT, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in Numeracy; instead, it  increased . [sent-17, score-0.56]
</p><p>3 My reply:   This is indeed consistent with the red-state-blue-state constellation of findings, in which political polarization shows up more in higher-income groups. [sent-20, score-0.598]
</p><p>4 I have a question for you on that — but it requires a bit of a set up…      There are a collection of characeristics that are associated with intensity of polarization that seem independent of the strength of partisan id. [sent-33, score-0.614]
</p><p>5 Is this b/c “political knowledge” measures how reliably individuals can make sense of information relevant to determining policy positions that “fit” their political outlooks? [sent-43, score-0.435]
</p><p>6 Because this is not consistent with the position that “political knowledge” amplifies polarization by improving the accuracy of citizens’ assessment of how policies advance their political values (Zaller’s view), L&T; treat it as evidence of the “irrationality” of partisanship. [sent-54, score-0.909]
</p><p>7 System 2″ dual-process reasoning framework, they treat “political knowledge” as a measure of partisanship, which they posit interacts with “confirmation bias,” one of the myriad deficiencies in reasoning associated with System 1. [sent-57, score-0.57]
</p><p>8 Our account for this is that politically motivated reasoning *is* rational. [sent-61, score-0.416]
</p><p>9 When positions on issues become understood as badges of membership in & loyalty to competing cultural groups, then individuals will have a stake in forming identity-supportive beliefs that dominates their stake in forming evidence-justified beliefs. [sent-63, score-0.63]
</p><p>10 But those who are proficient in critical reasoning can do an even better job, b/c they can more effectively identify evidence supportive of their group’s position and  explain away  evidence hostile to it. [sent-71, score-0.446]
</p><p>11 One  was an observational study showing that polarization is highest among persons who are highest in science comprehension (measured w/ a scale that combined science literacy & quantitative reasoning ability). [sent-74, score-0.976]
</p><p>12 The next two were experimental, and were designed to “catch in the act” the contribution that critical reasoning dispositions of one or another sort make to the stake people have in persisting in in beliefs consistent with their group identity. [sent-75, score-0.77]
</p><p>13 The results of these experiments help to corroborate that people more proficient in critical reasoning are more polarized  because  they are using their skills and capacities to promote identity-supportive beliefs…. [sent-76, score-0.627]
</p><p>14 Of course, to say politically motivated reasoning is “individually rational” is not to say it is morally desirable. [sent-78, score-0.416]
</p><p>15 My sense is that it generates the results L&T; observe not b/c it is a measure of partisanship but b/c it correlates with & is thus an indicator of critical reasoning dispositions. [sent-83, score-0.612]
</p><p>16 I should figure out how to test this conjecture about why political knowledge amplifies polarization…. [sent-85, score-0.361]
</p><p>17 Now , how do you understand the correlation between income & greater polarization to fit in? [sent-86, score-0.493]
</p><p>18 Income might be correlated with ability to accurately assess how positions promote values — the conventional (Zaller) account of why political knowledge predicts a greater connection between partisan id & polarization. [sent-87, score-0.742]
</p><p>19 Or maybe it is correlated with critical reasoning dispositions of the sort that our studies enable  expressive rationality –an engagement of information aimed at maximizing congruence between belief & political or cultural identity. [sent-88, score-0.842]
</p><p>20 Feel free to offer your thoughts in the comments, both on the topic of political polarization and on the importance (or lack thereof) of the “empirical implications of theoretical models” perspective, which I see as currently dominant in social science. [sent-117, score-0.598]

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan and colleagues  write :
  
The Cultural Cognition Project is a group of scholars interested in studying how cultural values shape public risk perceptions and related policy beliefs.   Cultural cognition refers to the tendency of individuals to conform their beliefs about disputed matters of fact (e.g., whether global warming is a serious threat; whether the death penalty deters murder; whether gun control makes society more safe or less) to values that define their cultural identities. Project members are using the methods of various disciplines — including social psychology, anthropology, communications, and political science — to chart the impact of this phenomenon and to identify the mechanisms through which it operates. The Project also has an explicit normative objective: to identify processes of democratic decisionmaking by which society can resolve culturally grounded differences in belief in a manner that is both congenial to persons of diverse cultural outlooks and c</p><p>3 0.17532034 <a title="2050-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating_evidence_from_published_research.html">2006 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating evidence from published research</a></p>

You give me credit, I think, for merely participating in what I think is a systemic effect in the practice of empirical inquiry that conduces to quality control & hence the advance of knowledge by such means (likely the title conveys that!).  I’d say:


(a) by far the greatest weakness in the “publication regime” in social sciences today is the systematic disregard for basic principles of valid causal inference, a deficiency either in comprehension or craft that is at the root of scholars’ resort to (and journals’ tolerance for) invalid samples, the employment of designs that don’t generate observations more consistent with a hypothesis than with myriad rival ones, and the resort to deficient statistical modes of analysis that treat detection of “statististically significant difference” rather than “practical corroboration of practical meaningful effect” as the goal of such analysis (especial</p><p>4 0.17463438 <a title="2050-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-21-Kahan_on_Pinker_on_politics.html">1633 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-21-Kahan on Pinker on politics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve earlier written that  science is science communication —that is, the act of communicating scientific ideas and findings to ourselves and others is itself a central part of science.  My point was to push against a conventional separation between the act of science and the act of communication, the idea that science is done by scientists and communication is done by communicators.  It’s a rare bit of science that does not include communication as part of it.  As a scientist and science communicator myself, I’m particularly sensitive to devaluing of communication.  (For example, Bayesian Data Analysis is full of original research that was done in order to communicate; or, to put it another way, we often think we understand a scientific idea, but once we try to communicate it, we recognize gaps in our understanding that motivate further research.)

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins  writes :
  
When native Australians or New Guineans say that their totemic animals and plants are their kinsmen – that these species are persons like themselves, and that in offering them to others they are giving away part of their own substance – we have to take them seriously, which is to say empirically, if we want to understand the large consequences of these facts for how they organise their lives. The graveyard of ethnographic studies is strewn with the remains of reports which, thanks to anthropologists’ own presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact, were content to ignore or debunk the Amazonian peoples who said that the animals they hunted were their brothers-in-law, the Africans who described the way they systematically killed their kings when they became weak, or the Fijian chiefs who claimed they were gods.
  
My first thought was . . . wait a minute!  Whazzat with “presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact”?

<p>Introduction: Steven Pinker  writes :
  
Human beings live in groups, are affected by the fortunes of their groups, and sometimes make sacrifices that benefit their groups. Does this mean that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to promote the welfare of the group in competition with other groups, even when it damages the welfare of the person and his or her kin? . . .


Several scientists whom I [Pinker] greatly respect have said so in prominent places. And they have gone on to use the theory of group selection to make eye-opening claims about the human condition. They have claimed that human morailty, particularly our willingness to engage in acts of altruism, can be explained as an adaptation to group-against-group competition. As E. O. Wilson explains, “In a group, selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals. But, groups of altruistic individuals beat groups of selfish individuals.” . . .

<p>Introduction: Steven Hayward at the American Enterprise Institute wrote  an article , sure to attract the attention of people such as myself, entitled, “The irrelevance of modern political science,” in which he discusses some silly-sounding papers presented at the recent American Political Science Association and then moves to a larger critique of quantitative political science:
  
 
I [Hayward] have often taken a random article from the American Political Science Review, which resembles a mathematical journal on most of its pages, and asked students if they can envision this method providing the mathematical formula that will deliver peace in the Middle East. Even the dullest students usually grasp the point without difficulty.
 

 
At the sister blog, John Sides  discusses and dismisses  Hayward’s arguments, point on that, among other things, political science might very well be useful  even if  it doesn’t deliver peace in the Middle East.

My graphs– what do you think??

 

I guess what do you think of the result too, but the answer is, “That’s obvious!”  If it hadn’t been, then it would have been suspicious in my book. Of course, if we had found the opposite result, that would have been “obvious!” too.  We are submitting to   LR ≠1 Journa l 

 This is the latest study in series looking at relationship between critical reasoning capacities and “cultural cognition” — the tendency of individuals to conform their perceptions of risk & other policy-relevant facts to their group commitments. The first installment was an  observational study  that found that cultural polarization ( political too ; the distinction relate not to the mechanism for polarization over decision-relevant science but only about  how to measure  what is hypothesized to be driving it) increases as people become more science literate.

<p>Introduction: Raghuveer Parthasarathy pointed me to an article in Nature by Mina Bissell, who  writes , “The push to replicate findings could shelve promising research and unfairly damage the reputations of careful, meticulous scientists.”
 
I can see where she’s coming from:  if you work hard day after day in the lab, it’s gotta be a bit frustrating to find all your work questioned, for the frauds of the  Dr. Anil Pottis  and Diederik Stapels to be treated as a reason for everyone else’s work to be considered guilty until proven innocent.
 
That said, I pretty much disagree with Bissell’s article, and really the best thing I can say about it is that I think it’s a good sign that the push for replication is so strong that now there’s a backlash against it.  Traditionally, leading scientists have been able to simply ignore the push for replication.  If they are feeling that the replication movement is strong enough that they need to fight it, that to me is good news.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  comments on  the (presumably) well-intentioned but silly  Jumpstart test of financial literacy , which was given to 7000 high school seniors  Given that, as we heard a few years back, most high school seniors can’t locate Miami on a map of the U.S., you won’t be surprised to hear that they flubbed item after item on this quiz.
 
But, as Palko points out, the concept is better than the execution:
  
 
With the complex, unstable economy, the shift away from traditional pensions and the constant flood of new financial products, financial literacy might be more important now than it has been for decades. You could even make the case for financial illiteracy being a major cause of the economic crisis.


But if the supporters of financial literacy need a good measure of how well we’re doing, they’ll need to find a better instrument than the Jump$tart survey.


The ‘test’ part of the survey consists of thirty-one questions.

<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>6 0.97482252 <a title="2050-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-27-%E2%80%9CWhat_Can_we_Learn_from_the_Many_Labs_Replication_Project%3F%E2%80%9D.html">2227 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-27-“What Can we Learn from the Many Labs Replication Project?”</a></p>

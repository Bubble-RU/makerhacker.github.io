<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>3 0.20077097 <a title="1796-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Confusing_headline_and_capitalization_leads_to_hopes_raised%2C_then_dashed.html">1608 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Confusing headline and capitalization leads to hopes raised, then dashed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read the following under the  headline , Behind a Flop, a Play(wright) Within a Play”:
  
A stroll down West 45th Street in the theater district is all it takes to understand the contradictory fortunes facing David Mamet, for years the heavyweight of bare-knuckled American playwrights, as well as the producers who believe that loyalty to the writer makes good business sense.


At the Schoenfeld Theater is Mr. Mamet’s latest box-office hit: A revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross,” his Pulitzer Prize-winning crowd-pleaser from 1984 about an office of desperately scheming salesmen. The producers are charging up to $377 a ticket simply on the drawing power of their star, Al Pacino, even before its official opening this weekend.
  
My first thought was, Cool!  Mamet wrote a new play called “A revival of ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’” with a play within a play.
 
My second thought was, No way am I paying $377 a ticket for this.  Too bad it’s not more reasonably priced.

<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email saying that he liked my little essay, “Descriptive statistics aren’t just for losers.”  I had no idea what he was talking about, but it sounded like the kind of thing I’d say, so I searched the blog and found  this post , which indeed I really like!
 
I thanked my correspondent for reminding me of this little article I’d forgotten, and he told me he just learned of it via someone’s tweet.
 
This made me think:  Maybe I should have a twitter feed of nothing but old blog entries.  I could just go back to 2004 and then go gradually forward, tweeting the items that I judge to remain of interest.
 
Does this make sense?  Or is there a better way to do this?  ALternatively, I could do it as a separate blog, but that seems a bit . . . recursive.</p><p>3 0.76427495 <a title="1796-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-The_Great_Race.html">1831 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-The Great Race</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Last summer my wife and I took a 3.5-month vacation that included a wide range of activities. When I got back, people would ask “what were the highlights or your trip?”, and I was somewhat at a loss: we had done so many things that were so different, many of which seemed really great…how could I pick? Someone said, wisely, that in six months or a year I’d be able to answer the question because some memories would be more vivid than others. They were right, and I was recently thinking back on our vacation and putting together a list of highlights — enjoyable in itself, but also worth doing to help plan future vacations.
 
One of the things we did was go to four evenings of track and field events at the London Olympics. After we got back, people would ask what we had seen at the Olympics. I would say “We saw Usain Bolt run the 200m, we saw the women’s 4x100m relay and the men’s 4×400, we saw the last events of the decathlon…lots of great stuff. But my favorite was</p><p>4 0.75796348 <a title="1796-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-04-Someone_is_wrong_on_the_internet.html">1561 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-04-Someone is wrong on the internet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of googling myself (I know, I know . . .) and came across a couple of rude bloggers criticizing something I’d written.  I don’t mind criticism, and lord knows I can be a rude blogger myself at times, but these criticisms were really bad, a mix of already-refuted arguments and new claims that were just flat-out ridiculous.  Really bad stuff.  I then spent about an hour, on and off, writing a long long post explaining why they were wrong and how they could make their arguments better.  But then, before I hit Send, I realized it would a mistake to post my response.  Getting into a fight with these people whom I’d never heard of before . . . what’s the point?  If they want to comment on my blog, I will respond (within reason), or if they are well known researchers or journalists, it’s perhaps worth correcting them.  Or if they made an interesting argument, sure.  But there’s no point in scouring the web looking for  bad  arguments to refute.  That way lies madness.

<p>Introduction: I, like  Steve Hsu , I too would love to read a definitive biography of John von Neumann (or, as we’d say in the U.S., “John Neumann”).  I’ve read little things about him in various places such as Stanislaw Ulam’s classic autobiography, and two things I’ve repeatedly noticed are:
 
1.  Neumann comes off as a obnoxious, self-satisfied jerk.  He just seems like the kind of guy I wouldn’t like in real life.
 
2.  All these great men seem to really have loved the guy.
 
It’s hard for me to reconcile  two impressions above.  Of course, lots of people have a good side and a bad side, but what’s striking here is that my impressions of Neumann’s bad side come from the very stories that his friends use to demonstrate how lovable he was!  So, yes, I’d like to see the biography–but only if it could resolve this paradox.
 
Also, I don’t know how relevant this is, but Neumann shares one thing with the more-lovable Ulam and the less-lovable Mandelbrot:  all had Jewish backgrounds but didn’t seem to</p><p>6 0.74012059 <a title="1796-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-28-Behavioral_economics_doesn%E2%80%99t_seem_to_have_much_to_say_about_marriage.html">594 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-28-Behavioral economics doesn’t seem to have much to say about marriage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I only read the  review , not the book.  What puzzled me was not any  lack of self-awareness  but rather this bit:
  
The title of Mr. Rushdie’s new memoir . . . comes from the alias he assumed when British police told him back in 1989 that he needed a pseudonym: the Joseph comes from Joseph Conrad, the Anton from Anton Chekhov. The protection officers issued to him by the British government soon took to calling him “Joe,” an abbreviation he says he detested.
  
The thing that I don’t understand is why he detested the nickname.  If I were in a comparable situation, I think I’d appreciate if my security detail gave me a friendly nickname.  Then again, with the stress that Rushdie’s been under, I can imagine all sorts of personality transformations.</p><p>2 0.86150944 <a title="1796-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Computer_models_of_the_oil_spill.html">243 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Computer models of the oil spill</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Wilson points me to  this visualizatio n of three physical models of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Cool (and scary) stuff.  Wilson writes:
  
One of the major advantages is that the models are 3D and show the plumes and tails beneath the surface. One of the major disadvantages is that theyâ&euro;&trade;re still just models.</p><p>3 0.84307301 <a title="1796-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Demographics%3A_what_variable_best_predicts_a_financial_crisis%3F.html">149 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Demographics: what variable best predicts a financial crisis?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I wrote about the importance of demographics in  political trends . Today I’d like to show you how demographics help predict financial crises.
 
Here are a few examples of countries with major crises.
  
 
 
 The working-age population in Japan  peaked in the 1995 census . 
  The 1995 Financial Crisis in Japan  
 
 
 
 
  The working-age USA population growth slows down to unprecedented levels in 2008 (see figure below) 

 

  Financial crisis of 2007-2010 . (Also, notice previous dips in 2001, 1991 and 1981, and consider the  list of recessions .) 
 
 
  China’s working-age population, age 15 to 64, has grown continuously. The labor pool will  peak in 2015  and then decline.  
  
There are more charts in  Demography and Growth  report by the Reserve Bank of Australia:
 
   
 
Wikipedia surveys  the causes of the financial crisis,  such as “liquidity shortfall in the United States banking system caused by the overvaluation of assets”. Oh my!

<p>Introduction: . . . sounded  exactly  like a David Mamet character.  I mean, exactly.  Or like Eric Bogosian doing a David Mamet character.  I only wish I had a good ear for dialogue and could get it down for you.  OK, we don’t use the word fuck on this blog but I could substitute something like f*** and you’d get the point.
 
He was on his cell phone and seemed to be talking with his wife or girlfriend, explaining why they should get back together.

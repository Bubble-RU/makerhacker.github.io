<p>Introduction: From the website of a journal where I published an article:
  
In Springer journals you have the choice of publishing with or without open access. If you choose open access, your article will be freely available to everyone everywhere. In exchange for an open access fee of â&sbquo;Ź 2000 / US $3000 you retain the copyright and your article will carry the Creative Commons License. Please make your choice below.
  
Hmmm . . . pay $3000 so that an article that I wrote and gave to the journal for free can be accessed by others?  Sounds like a good deal to me!</p><p>3 0.068230949 <a title="1711-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-23-PubMed_Commons%3A_A_system_for_commenting_on_articles_in_PubMed.html">2075 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-23-PubMed Commons: A system for commenting on articles in PubMed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rob “ Lasso ” Tibshirani writes:
  
We all read a lot of papers and often have useful things to say about them, but there is no systematic way to do this ­ lots of journals have commenting systems, but they’re clunky, and, most importantly, they’re scattered across thousands of sites. Journals don’t encourage critical comments from readers, and letters to the editor are difficult to publish and given too little space. If we’re ever going to develop a culture of commenting on the literature, we need to have a simple and centralized way of doing it.


Last year, I [Tibshirani] approached my Stanford colleague Pat Brown, a founder of PLOS, with the idea of creating a site where scientists could comment on ANY published research article ­ something like comments on movies at Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) or comments on books and other products at Amazon. Pat said that he been discussing similar ideas with his PLOS co­founder Michael Eisen, and that they felt strongly that a standalone si</p><p>4 0.06477876 <a title="1711-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-More_consulting_experiences%2C_this_time_in_computational_linguistics.html">1596 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-More consulting experiences, this time in computational linguistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>5 0.062805429 <a title="1711-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning_to_Stan.html">2291 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-14-Transitioning to Stan</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kevin Cartier writes:
  
I’ve been happily using R for a number of years now and recently came across Stan. Looks big and powerful, so I’d like to pick an appropriate project and try it out. I wondered if you could point me to a link or document that goes into the motivation for this tool (aside from the Stan user doc)?  What I’d like to understand is, at what point might you look at an emergent R project and advise, “You know, that thing you’re trying to do would be a whole lot easier/simpler/more straightforward to implement with Stan.” (or words to that effect).
  
My reply:  For my collaborators in political science, Stan has been most useful for models where the data set is not huge (e.g., we might have 10,000 data points or 50,000 data points but not 10 million) but where the model is somewhat complex (for example, a model with latent time series structure).  The point is that the model has enough parameters and uncertainty that you’ll want to do full Bayes (rather than some sort</p><p>6 0.060653113 <a title="1711-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you need an excuse to go skiing in Tahoe next month, our paper on Stan as a probabilistic programming language was accepted for:
  
  Workshop on Probabilistic Programming  
NIPS 2012 
7–8 December, 2012, Lake Tahoe, Nevada
   
The workshop is organized by the folks behind the probabilistic programming language  Church  and has a great lineup of invited speakers (Chris Bishop, Josh Tennenbaum, and Stuart Russell).  And in case you’re interested in the main conference, here’s the list of accepted  NIPS 2012 papers and posters .  
 
To learn more about Stan, check out the links to the manual on the
  
  Stan Home Page  
  
We’ll put up a link to our final NIPS workshop paper there when we finish it.</p><p>3 0.76534772 <a title="1711-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-05-Stan_%28quietly%29_passes_512_people_on_the_users_list.html">2124 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-05-Stan (quietly) passes 512 people on the users list</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan  is alive and well. We’re up to 523 people on the  users list .  [We're sure there are many more than 523 actual users, since it's easy to download and use Stan directly without joining the list.]

<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>5 0.7608633 <a title="1711-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-23-Foundation_for_Open_Access_Statistics.html">1820 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-23-Foundation for Open Access Statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now here’s a foundation I (Bob) can get behind: 
  

 Foundation for Open Access Statistics  (FOAS)

  
Their  mission  is to “promote free software, open access publishing, and reproducible research in statistics.”  To me, that’s like supporting  motherhood and apple pie !
 
FOAS spun out of and is partially designed to support the   Journal of Statistical Software   (aka  JSS , aka  JStatSoft ). I adore  JSS  because it (a) is open access, (b) publishes systems papers on statistical software, (c) has fast reviewing turnaround times, and (d) is free for authors and readers.  One of the next items on my to-do list is to write up the  Stan  modeling language and submit it to  JSS .
 
As a not-for-profit with no visible source of income, they are quite sensibly  asking for donations  (don’t complain — it beats $3K author fees or not being able to read papers).</p><p>6 0.75307888 <a title="1711-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-07-Stan_users_meetup_next_week.html">2325 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-07-Stan users meetup next week</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amy Hundley writes in the New Yorker about a notorious recent case of unacknowledged literary  quilting :
  
I [Hundley] was the editor at Grove/Atlantic to whom Quentin Rowan’s novel “Appearance and the Park” was submitted (“The Plagiarist’s Tale,” by Lizzie Widdicombe, February 13th & 20th). Widdicombe writes that the editor in question thought that “its plot was too close to that of another of the house’s books, ‘My Idea of Fun,’ by Will Self,” and I can only assume that this explanation came from Rowan. In fact, Rowan had lifted a passage nearly verbatim from Will Self’s novella “The Sweet Smell of Psychosis.” It was an especially delicious one, in which Self describes the media denizens of a particular bar. I recognized it immediately and informed his agent that he’d plagiarized it. Writing a plot similar to a successful novelist’s—something that can arise innocently—is very different from plagiarizing. Appropriating and remixing someone else’s work while acknowledging sources is</p><p>2 0.91258419 <a title="1711-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Stand_Your_Ground_laws_and_homicides.html">1397 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Stand Your Ground laws and homicides</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90020871 <a title="1711-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-How_Open_Should_Academic_Papers_Be%3F.html">1711 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-How Open Should Academic Papers Be?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Richard Van Noorden reports  in  Nature  that 95% of the authors submitting to the Nature Publishing Group choose more restrictive open-source licenses, CC-BY-NC-SA or CC-BY-NC-ND, even when given the opportunity to use a much more open license, CC-BY.  (I include their data below.)
 
How open should papers be?  Should authors own their work or should universities?  What if they’re paid for by a government research grant?  For instance, should NIH go further in requiring openness than it already has?  
 
Personally, I don’t mind publishers trying to make a buck off my papers.  But I don’t want to write something and then hand them the copyright, because then they’ll try to restrict the distribution.
  Creative Commons Licenses  
Here’s the license cheat sheet, straight from  Creative Commons :

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  reports  on the sympathy that well-known physicist Freeman Dyson has with crackpot theorists.  The interesting part is that Dyson has positive feelings for these cranks,  even while believing that their theories are completely wrong :
  
In my [Dyson's] career as a scientist, I twice had the good fortune to be a personal friend of a famous dissident. One dissident, Sir Arthur Eddington, was an insider like Thomson and Tait. The other, Immanuel Velikovsky, was an outsider like Carter. Both of them were tragic figures, intellectually brilliant and morally courageous, with the same fatal flaw as Carter. Both of them were possessed by fantasies that people with ordinary common sense could recognize as nonsense. I made it clear to both that I did not believe their fantasies, but I admired them as human beings and as imaginative artists. I admired them most of all for their stubborn refusal to remain silent. With the whole world against them, they remained true to their beliefs.</p><p>6 0.88137394 <a title="1711-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-28-Asymmetry_in_Political_Bias.html">683 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-28-Asymmetry in Political Bias</a></p>

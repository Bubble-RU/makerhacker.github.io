<p>Introduction: About 12 years ago Greg Wawro, Sy Spilerman, and I started a M.A. program here in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences, jointly between the departments of history, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and statistics.  We created a bunch of new features for the program, including an interdisciplinary course based on  this book .

<p>Introduction: Frontiers of Science is a course offered as part of Columbia University’s Core Curriculum.  The course is controversial, with some people praising its overview of several areas of science, and others feeling that a more traditional set of introductory science courses would do the job better.
 
Last month, the faculty in charge of the course wrote the following public  letter : 
  
  
The United States is in the midst of a debate over the value of a traditional college education. Why enroll in a place like Columbia College when you can obtain an undergraduate degree for $10,000 or learn everything from Massive Open Online Courses? In more parochial terms, what is the value added by approaches such as Columbia’s Core Curriculum? Recently students in our Core Course, Frontiers of Science (FoS), provided a partial answer. The FoS faculty designed a survey to gauge the scientific skills and knowledge of the Class of 2016 both before and after taking FoS.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.
 
The question then arises:  why do descriptions of data science focus so</p><p>5 0.10100476 <a title="2016-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-07-Feedback_on_my_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_class_at_Columbia.html">1611 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-07-Feedback on my Bayesian Data Analysis class at Columbia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: We’re working with polling company YouGov to track public opinion, state-by-state and district-by-district, during the 2014 campaign.  We’ll be using multilevel regression and poststratification, and implementing it in Stan, and developing the necessary new parts of Stan to get this running scalably and efficiently.  And we’ll be making the most detailed, up-to-date election forecasts.
 
What you’ll be doing if you join us as a postdoc: 
- You’ll be in the midst of the most advanced polling team anywhere; 
- You’ll be doing cutting-edge statistical research on MRP with deep interactions; 
- You’ll be doing basic research in statistical computing, developing fast and scalable deterministic and stochastic algorithms for fitting multilevel models; 
- You’ll be working inside Stan, the most advanced general computational framework for Bayesian analysis. 
 We’re doing research, not just implementing existing methods.

 I’m helping with a  Data Science for Social Good  summer fellowship program at the University of Chicago. 
  
 The goal is to train data scientists that can tackle problems in education, healthcare, energy, transportation, and more. Working with full-time mentors from academia, industry, and the  Obama campaign , fellows will build high-impact analytics projects using statistics, machine learning, data mining, and big data technologies. 
  
 
   
 
 For fellows, we’re looking for grad students, advanced undergrads, and professionals in computer science, machine learning, statistics, and the computational and quantitative sciences. For mentors, we’re looking for folks with practical data science experience. 
  
 
   
 
 
 Fellows and mentors will be paid competitively and housed in Chicago for duration of the program, from early June to late August.

<p>Introduction: Katie Kent writes:
  
I’m with  Zipfian Academy  – we’re launching next week as the first 12-week immersive program to teach data science. The program combines the hard and soft skills of data science with introductions to the data science community out here in San Francisco.


The launch will be covered by a couple big tech blogs, but we’d love to offer the opportunity to blog about it to some smaller and well-respected data science blogs like yours. 
  
I don’t know anything about this but I took a look at the website and it looks pretty cool.  Maybe in a future iteration of their course, they can teach Stan, once it has a few more useful features such as VB and EP.</p><p>2 0.96189761 <a title="2016-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-12-UnConMax_%E2%80%93_uncertainty_consideration_maxims_7_%2B--_2.html">82 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-12-UnConMax – uncertainty consideration maxims 7 +-- 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Warning – this blog post is meant to encourage some loose, fuzzy and possibly distracting thoughts about the practice of statistics in research endeavours. There maybe spelling and grammatical errors as well as a lack of proper sentence structure. It may not be understandable to many or even possibly any readers. 
 
But somewhat more seriously, its better that “ConUnMax”
 
So far I have five maxims
 
1. Explicit models of uncertanty are useful but – always wrong and can always be made less wrong 
2. If the model is formally a probability model –  always use probability calculus (Bayes) 
3. Always useful to make the model a formal probability model – no matter what (Bayesianisn) 
4. Never use a model that is not empirically motivated and strongly empirically testable (Frequentist – of the anti-Bayesian flavour) 
5. Quantitative tools are always just a means to grasp and manipulate models – never an end in itself (i.e. don’t obsess over “baby” mathematics)

(actually, in 5 minutes)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?  Thanks.</p><p>4 0.96024603 <a title="2016-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-13-Question_3_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1317 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-13-Question 3 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 3. We discussed in class the best currently available method for estimating the proportion of military servicemembers who are gay. What is that method? (Recall the problems with the direct approach: there is no simple way to survey servicemembers at random, nor is it likely that they would answer such a question honestly.)
 
 Solution to question 2 
 
From  yesterday :
  
2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)


(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.


(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.


(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.


(d) With a small sample size, you cannot hope to learn anything conclusive, but you can get a crude estimate of effect size and standard deviation which will be useful in a po</p><p>5 0.95816875 <a title="2016-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-02-My_course_this_fall_on_l%E2%80%99analyse_bay%C3%A9sienne_de_donn%C3%A9es.html">1965 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-02-My course this fall on l’analyse bayésienne de données</a></p>
<p>Introduction: X marks the  spot .  I’ll post the slides soon (not just for the students in my class; these should be helpful for anyone teaching Bayesian data analysis from  our book ).

<p>Introduction: Try  this link . . . .
 
OK, it worked (as well as might be expected given that we don’t have any professional audiovisual people involved).  Tomorrow 8h30, I’ll post a new link with the new G+ hangout.  We’ll be going through the first two sets of slides (class1a.pdf and class1b.pdf) following the link for the slides  here .</p><p>3 0.19328916 <a title="1673-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-02-My_course_this_fall_on_l%E2%80%99analyse_bay%C3%A9sienne_de_donn%C3%A9es.html">1965 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-02-My course this fall on l’analyse bayésienne de données</a></p>
<p>Introduction: X marks the  spot .  I’ll post the slides soon (not just for the students in my class; these should be helpful for anyone teaching Bayesian data analysis from  our book ).  But I don’t think you’ll get much from reading the slides alone; you’ll get more out of the book (or, of course, from taking the class).</p><p>4 0.18033284 <a title="1673-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>6 0.82596445 <a title="1673-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-I_just_skyped_in_from_Kentucky%2C_and_boy_are_my_arms_tired.html">438 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-I just skyped in from Kentucky, and boy are my arms tired</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about that Yale professor who wrote that book,  remember , she screamed at her daughters all the time and didn’t let them go the bathroom while they were practicing piano (violin?), Asian parenting-style etc etc.
 
I was just wondering . . . what if she’d had sons rather than daughters?  What are the rules?  Would bringing up boys be the job of mellow white dad rather than intense Asian mom?  If mom were still in charge, would the boys be doing piano, or something else like hockey?  Tiger Mom seems to be into traditional values so I’m assuming she’d want her kids doing something sex-stereotyped?  But sports would be tough, her (hypothetical) boys would have to compete with big strong athletes and would be less likely to be winners so then she couldn’t brag about her amazing parenting skills.
 
I really don’t know the answer to this one.  Maybe some of our readers who are Yale law professors can enlighten us?</p><p>2 0.95447743 <a title="1673-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-My_talk_at_the_University_of_Michigan_today_4pm.html">1778 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-My talk at the University of Michigan today 4pm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94880283 <a title="1673-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-My_talk_last_night_at_the_visualization_meetup.html">1673 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-My talk last night at the visualization meetup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It  went pretty well, especially considering it was an  entirely new talk  (even though, paradoxically, all the images were old), and even though I had a tough act to follow:  I came on immediately after an excellent short presentation by Jed Dougherty on some cool information and visualization software that he and his colleagues are building for social workers.
 
The only problems with my were:
 
(a) I planned to elicit more audience involvement but didn’t do it. It would’ve been easy:  at any point I could’ve just paused and had the audience members work in pairs to come up with suggested improvements to any of my graphs.  But I forgot to do it.
 
(b) I went on too long.  The talk was going so well, I didn’t stop.  In retrospect, it would’ve been better to stop earlier.  Better for people to leave the table hungry than stuffed.
 
Also, next time I’ll drop the bit about the nuns-in-prison movies.  People weren’t getting the connection to the point I was making about presetting the sig</p><p>4 0.94732428 <a title="1673-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-The_Subtle_Micro-Effects_of_Peacekeeping.html">242 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-The Subtle Micro-Effects of Peacekeeping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>5 0.94285202 <a title="1673-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-10-I_guess_they_noticed_that_if_you_take_the_first_word_on_every_seventeenth_page%2C_it_spells_out_%E2%80%9CDeath_to_the_Shah%E2%80%9D.html">510 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-10-I guess they noticed that if you take the first word on every seventeenth page, it spells out “Death to the Shah”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following in email from our publisher:
  
I write with regards to the project to publish a China Edition of your book “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” (ISBN-13: 9780521686891) for the mainland Chinese market. I regret to inform you that we have been notified by our partner in China, Posts & Telecommunications Press (PTP), that due to various politically sensitive materials in the text, the China Edition has not met with the approval of the publishing authorities in China, and as such PTP will not be able to proceed with the publication of this edition. We will therefore have to cancel plans for the China Edition of your book. Please accept my apologies for this unforeseen development. If you have any queries regarding this, do feel free to let me know.

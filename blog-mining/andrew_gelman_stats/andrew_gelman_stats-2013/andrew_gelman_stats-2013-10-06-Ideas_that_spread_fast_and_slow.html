<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally. And 64 percent of its prostate cancer patients are alive at three years, vers</p><p>3 0.10763142 <a title="2053-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-26-Reflections_on_ethicsblogging.html">1694 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-26-Reflections on ethicsblogging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have to say, it distorts my internal incentives when I am happy to see really blatant examples of ethical lapses.  Sort of like when you’re cleaning the attic and searching for roaches:  on one hand, you’d be happy if there were none, but, still, there’s a thrill each time you find a roach and catch it—and, at that point, you want it to be a big ugly one!</p><p>4 0.1044994 <a title="2053-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-21-Could_I_use_a_statistics_coach%3F.html">968 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-21-Could I use a statistics coach?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a thought-provoking article subtitled “Top athletes and singers have coaches. Should you?,” surgeon/journalist Atul Gawande  describes  how, even after eight years and more than two thousand operations, he benefited from coaching (from a retired surgeon), just as pro athletes and accomplished musicians do.  He then talks about proposals to institute coaching for teachers to help them perform better.
 
This all makes sense to me—except that I’m a little worried about expansion of the teacher coaching program.  I can imagine it could work pretty well for teachers who are motivated to be coached—for example, I think I would get a lot out of it—but I’m afraid that if teacher coaching became a big business, it would get taken over by McKinsey-style scam artists.
 
But could I use a coach?
 
First, let me get rid of the easy questions.
 
1.  Yes, I could use a squash coach.  I enjoy squash and play when I can, but I’m terrible at it.  I’m sure a coach would help.

<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
An Oregon legislator, Mitch Greenlick, has  proposed to make it illegal  in Oregon to carry a child under six years old on one’s bike (including in a child seat) or in a bike trailer.  The guy says “”We’ve just done a study showing that 30 percent of riders biking to work at least three days a week have some sort of crash that leads to an injury… When that’s going on out there, what happens when you have a four year old on the back of a bike?”  The study is from Oregon Health Sciences University, at which the legislator is a professor. 
 
Greenlick also says “”If it’s true that it’s unsafe, we have an obligation to protect people. If I thought a law would save one child’s life, I would step in and do it. Wouldn’t you?”
 
There are two statistical issues here.  The first is in the category of “lies, damn lies, and statistics,” and involves the statement about how many riders have injuries.  As quoted on  a blog ,  the author of the study in question says th</p><p>3 0.87574703 <a title="2053-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-What_Do_We_Learn_from_Narrow_Randomized_Studies%3F.html">732 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-What Do We Learn from Narrow Randomized Studies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the headline, “A Raise Won’t Make You Work Harder,” Ray Fisman  writes :
  
To understand why it might be a bad idea to cut wages in recessions, it’s useful to know how workers respond to changes in pay–both positive and negative changes. Discussion on the topic goes back at least as far as Henry Ford’s “5 dollars a day,” which he paid to assembly line workers in 1914. The policy was revolutionary at the time, as the wages were more than double what his competitors were paying. This wasn’t charity. Higher-paid workers were efficient workers–Ford attracted the best mechanics to his plant, and the high pay ensured that employees worked hard throughout their eight-hour shifts, knowing that if their pace slackened, they’d be out of a job. Raising salaries to boost productivity became known as “efficiency wages.”
  
So far, so good.  Fisman then moves from history and theory to recent research:

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?

<p>Introduction: Matt Taibbi  writes :
  
Glenn Hubbard, Leading Academic and Mitt Romney Advisor, Took $1200 an Hour to Be Countrywide’s Expert Witness . . . Hidden among the reams of material recently filed in connection with the lawsuit of monoline insurer MBIA against Bank of America and Countrywide is a deposition of none other than Columbia University’s Glenn Hubbard. . . . Hubbard testified on behalf of Countrywide in the MBIA suit. He conducted an “analysis” that essentially concluded that Countrywide’s loans weren’t any worse than the loans produced by other mortgage originators, and that therefore the monstrous losses that investors in those loans suffered were due to other factors related to the economic crisis – and not caused by the serial misrepresentations and fraud in Countrywide’s underwriting.

<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.  Anyway, I’m pa</p><p>2 0.95714903 <a title="2053-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-29-Brain_Structure_and_the_Big_Five.html">490 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-29-Brain Structure and the Big Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many years ago, a research psychologist whose judgment I greatly respect told me that the characterization of personality by the so-called Big Five traits (extraversion, etc.) was old-fashioned.  So I’m always surprised to see that the Big Five keeps cropping up.  I guess not everyone agrees that it’s a bad idea.
 
For example, Hamdan Azhar wrote to me:
  
 
I was wondering if you’d seen  this recent paper  (De Young et al. 2010) that finds significant correlations between brain volume in selected regions and personality trait measures (from the Big Five). This is quite a ground-breaking finding and it was covered extensively in the mainstream media. I think readers of your blog would be interested in your thoughts, statistically speaking, on their methodology and findings.
 

 
My reply:   I’d  be interested in my thoughts on this too!  But I don’t know enough to say anything useful.

<p>Introduction: Stephen Ansolabehere, Marc Meredith, and Erik Snowberg  write :
  
The literature on economic voting notes that voters’ subjective evaluations of the overall state of the economy are correlated with vote choice, whereas personal economic experiences are not. Missing from this literature is a description of how voters acquire information about the general state of the economy, and how that information is used to form perceptions. In order to begin understanding this process, we [Ansolabehere, Meredith, and Snowberg] asked a series of questions on the 2006 ANES Pilot about respondents’ perceptions of the average price of gas and the unemployment rate in their home state.


We find that questions about gas prices and unemployment show differences in the sources of information about these two economic variables. Information about unemployment rates come from media sources, and are systematically biased by partisan factors. Information about gas prices, in contrast, comes only from everyday</p><p>5 0.93613476 <a title="2053-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Term_Limits_for_the_Supreme_Court%3F.html">235 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Term Limits for the Supreme Court?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the wake of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, political commentators have been expressing a bit of frustration about polarization within the court and polarization in the nomination process.  One proposal that’s been floating around is to replace lifetime appointments by fixed terms, perhaps twelve or eighteen years.  This would enforce a regular schedule of replacements, instead of the current system in which eighty-something judges have an incentive to hang on as long as possible so as to time their retirements to be during the administration of a politically-compatible president.
 
A couple weeks ago at the sister blog, John Sides  discussed  some recent research that was relevant to the judicial term limits proposal.  Political scientists Justin Crowe and Chris Karpowitz analyzed the historical record or Supreme Court terms and found that long terms of twenty years or more have been happening since the early years of the court.  Yes, there is less turnover th</p><p>6 0.93366241 <a title="2053-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Forensic_bioinformatics%2C_or%2C_Don%E2%80%99t_believe_everything_you_read_in_the_%28scientific%29_papers.html">360 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Forensic bioinformatics, or, Don’t believe everything you read in the (scientific) papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>6 0.13493712 <a title="1988-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I sometimes get books in the mail that seem right in my wheelhouse, but actually I have nothing useful to say because I’m not part of the target audience.
 
An example:  the book Painting With Numbers by Randall Bolton on “presenting financials and other numbers so people will understand you.”  The author seems well-connected; the book has blurbs from a CEO, a COO, a bank vice-chairman, a former White House chief of staff, and Congressman Tom Campbell.  So I assume the author knows something about business communication.  But I have no way of evaluating the book.  Any given page seems to contain useful information—for example, I just opened to page 73, which is all about not wasting your audience’s time, a principle which I am often emphasizing.  Now I flip to page 120, which has “Long-Term Payoff Tip #8:  Document Your Work!”  Good point.  My next flip takes us to page 175, which covers the value of getting audience feedback.

<p>Introduction: This  post by Jordan Ellenberg (“Stoner represents a certain strain in the mid-century American novel that I really like, and which I don’t think exists in contemporary fiction.  Anguish, verbal restraint, weirdness”) reminds me that what I really like is mid-to-late-twentieth-century  literary criticism .  I read a great book from the 50s, I think it was, by Anthony West (son of Rebecca West and H. G. Wells), who reviewed books for the New Yorker.  It was great, and it made me wish that other collections of his reviews had been published (they hadn’t). I’d also love to read collections of  Alfred Kazin ‘s reviews (there are some collections, but he published many many others that have never been reprinted) and others of that vintage.  I’m pretty sure these hypothetical books wouldn’t sell many copies, though. (I feel lucky, though, that at one point a publisher released a pretty fat collection of  Anthony Burgess ‘s book reviews.) It’s actually scary to think that many many more peopl</p><p>4 0.73599797 <a title="1988-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-17-6_links.html">806 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-17-6 links</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Browser asked me to recommend 6 articles for their readers.   Here’s  what I came up with.  I really wanted to link to  this one  but it wouldn’t mean much to people who don’t know New York.  I also recommended  this  (if you’ll forgive my reference to bowling), but I think it was too much of a primary source for their taste.</p><p>5 0.72928393 <a title="1988-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-01-MacKay_update%3A__where_12_comes_from.html">986 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-01-MacKay update:  where 12 comes from</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In reply to my  question , David MacKay writes:
  
You said that can imagine rounding up 9 to 10 – which would be elegant if we worked in base 10.


But in the UK we haven’t switched to base 10 yet, we still work in  dozens and grosses.  (One gross = 12^2 = 144.)  So I was taught (by John Skilling, probably) “a dozen samples are plenty”. 


Probably in an earlier draft of the book in 2001 I said “a dozen”, rather than “12″.  Then some feedbacker may have written and said “I don’t know what a dozen is”;  so then I sacrificed elegant language and replaced “dozen” by “12″, which  leads to your mystification. 


PS – please send the winner of your competition a free copy of my other book ( sewtha ) too, from me. 


PPS I see that Mikkel Schmidt [in your comments] has diligently found the correct answer, which I guessed above. I suggest you award the prizes to him.
  
OK, we’re just  giving  away books here!

P.S.  I don’t make any money through this link.  We do get some royalties from the book, but only a very small amount.  I’m pushing the Amazon link right now because (a) I think the book is great, and I want as many people as possible to have it, and (b) 40% off is a pretty good deal and I don’t know how long this will last.

<p>Introduction: Please answer the above question before reading on . . . 
   
I’m curious after reading Leif Nelson’s  report  that, based on research with Minah Jung, approximately 42% of the people they surveyed said they bought laundry detergent on their most recent trip to the store.  I’m stunned that the number is so high.  42%???  That’s almost half the time.  If we bought laundry detergent half the time we went to the store, our apartment would be stacked so full with the stuff, we wouldn’t be able to enter the door.
 
I think we buy laundry detergent . . . ummm, how often?  There are 40 of those little laundry packets in the box, we do laundry once a day, sometimes twice, let’s say 10 times a week, so this means we buy detergent about once every 4 weeks.  We go to the store, hmmm, about once a day, let’s say 5 times a week to put our guess on the conservative side.  So, 20 trips to the store for each purchase of detergent, that’s 5% of the time.

<p>Introduction: As a data analyst and a scientist, Fisher > Neyman, no question.  But as a theorist, Fisher came up with ideas that worked just fine in his applications but can fall apart when people try to apply them too generally.
 
Here’s an example that recently came up.
 
Deborah Mayo pointed me to a  comment  by Stephen Senn on the so-called Fisher and Neyman null hypotheses.  In an experiment with n participants (or, as we used to say, subjects or experimental units), the Fisher null hypothesis is that the treatment effect is exactly 0 for every one of the n units, while the Neyman null hypothesis is that the individual treatment effects can be negative or positive but have an average of zero.
 
Senn explains why Neyman’s hypothesis in general makes no sense—the short story is that Fisher’s hypothesis seems relevant in some problems (sometimes we really are studying effects that are zero or close enough for all practical purposes), whereas Neyman’s hypothesis just seems weird (it’s implausible</p><p>4 0.93328506 <a title="1988-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-15-Static_sensitivity_analysis.html">804 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-15-Static sensitivity analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite ideas.  I used it in an application but have never formally studied it or written it up as a general method.
 
Sensitivity analysis is when you check how inferences change when you vary fit several different models or when you vary inputs within a model.  Sensitivity analysis is often recommended but is typically difficult to do, what with the hassle of carrying around all these different estimates.  In Bayesian inference, sensitivity analysis is associated with varying the prior distribution, which irritates me:  why not consider sensitivity to the likelihood, as that’s typically just as arbitrary as the prior while having a much larger effect on the inferences.
 
So we came up with  static sensitivity analysis , which is a way to assess sensitivity to assumptions while fitting only one model.  The idea is that Bayesian posterior simulation gives you a range of parameter values, and from these you can learn about sensitivity directly.

<p>Introduction: According to a  New York Times article , cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have a new theory about rational argument: humans didn’t develop it in order to learn about the world, we developed it in order to win arguments with other people. “It was a purely social phenomenon. It evolved to help us convince others and to be careful when others try to convince us.” 
 
Based on the NYT article, it seems that Mercier and Sperber are basically flipping around the traditional argument, which is that humans learned to reason about the world, albeit imperfectly, and learned to use language to convey that reasoning to others.  These guys would suggest that it’s the other way around: we learned to argue with others, and this has gradually led to the ability to actually make (and recognize) sound arguments, but only indirectly.  The article says “”At least in some cultural contexts, this results in a kind of arms race towards greater sophistication in the production and evaluation o</p><p>6 0.93103051 <a title="1988-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-05-What_is_a_prior_distribution%3F.html">1155 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-05-What is a prior distribution?</a></p>

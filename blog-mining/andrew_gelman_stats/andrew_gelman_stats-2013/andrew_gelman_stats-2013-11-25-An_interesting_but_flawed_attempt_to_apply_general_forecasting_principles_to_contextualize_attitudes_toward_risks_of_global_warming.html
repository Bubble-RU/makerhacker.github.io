<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I’m aware that there  are  some people who use a Bayesian approach largely because it allows them to provide a highly informative prior distribution based subjective judgment, but that is not the appeal of Bayesian methods for a lot of us practitioners. It’s disappointing and surprising, twenty years after my initial experiences, to still hear highly informed professional statisticians who think that what distinguishes Bayesian statistics from Frequentist statistics is “subjectivity” ( as seen in  a recent blog post and its comments ).
 
 My first encounter with Bayesian statistics was just over 20 years ago. I was a postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a new PhD in theoretical atomic physics but working on various problems related to the geographical and statistical distribution of indoor radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be dangerous if present at high concentrations). One of the issues I ran into right at the start was th</p><p>5 0.13387449 <a title="2112-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-More_on_Bayesian_deduction-induction.html">114 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-More on Bayesian deduction-induction</a></p>

I read  your new article  on deduction/induction under Bayes.  There are a couple interesting papers from economic decision theory which are related that you might find interesting.
      
Samuelson et al have a (very) recent paper about what happens when you have some Bayesian and some non-Bayesian hypotheses.  (I  mentioned  this one on my blog earlier this year.)  Essentially, the Bayesian hypotheses are forced to “make predictions” in every future period (“if the unemployment rate is x%, the president is reelected with pr=x), whereas other forms of reasoning (say, analogies: “If the unemployment rate is above 10%, the president will not be reelected”).  Imagine you have some prior over, say, the economy and elections, with 99.9% of the hypotheses being Bayesian and the rest being analogies as above.  Then 100 years from now, because the analogies are so hard to refute, using deduction will push the proportion of Bayesian hypotheses toward zero.

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: A group of University of California professors headed by physicist Richard Muller recently released a  report  confirming global warming.  Then geophysicist Judith Curry, a coauthor on the papers produced by the Muller group, turned around and  said  that their data actually show that global warming has stopped.  (Also see clarification  here .)
 
Curry is described in the news article as the second author on the papers, but the authors are listed alphabetically so it’s probably more accurate to describe her as one of the ten authors.  Muller’s one, Curry’s another, . . . now I want to know what 7 of the other 8 authors think!  (One of the authors is Richard Muller’s daughter Elizabeth, so maybe we shouldn’t count her as an independent view.)
 
Some enterprising reporter should really interview the other 7 authors of  that report .  Just a quick question like, “Is there scientific basis for saying that warming hasn’t stopped?”

Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.


Chris Sheehan just sent me  this NYT article on air conditioning , where they mention this neat natural experiment:

 
[I]n the past year, [Japan] became an unwitting laboratory to study even more extreme air-conditioning abstinence, and the results have not been encouraging.

<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

<p>Introduction: David Kaplan writes:
  
I came across your  paper  “Understanding Posterior Predictive P-values”, and I have a question regarding your statement “If a posterior predictive p-value is 0.4, say, that means that, if we believe the model, we think there is a 40% chance that tomorrow’s value of T(y_rep) will exceed today’s T(y).” This is perfectly understandable to me and represents the idea of calibration.  However, I am unsure how this relates to statements about fit.  If T is the LR chi-square or Pearson chi-square, then your statement that there is a 40% chance that tomorrows value exceeds today’s value indicates bad fit, I think.  Yet, some literature indicates that high p-values suggest good fit.  Could you clarify this?
  
My reply:
 
I think that “fit” depends on the question being asked.  In this case, I’d say the model fits for this particular purpose, even though it might not fit for other purposes.
 
And here’s the abstract of the paper:

Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability. That is, if you have a hierarchical model, and the family history / classical histopathology already suggests a parameter estimate with some variance, how could the new genomic info possibly increase the variance of that parameter estimate?

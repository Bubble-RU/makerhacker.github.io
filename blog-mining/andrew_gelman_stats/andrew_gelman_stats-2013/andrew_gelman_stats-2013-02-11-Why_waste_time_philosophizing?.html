<p>Introduction: Here’s an article  that I believe is flat-out entertaining to read.  It’s about philosophy, so it’s supposed to be entertaining, in any case.
 
Here’s the abstract:
  
A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.






Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but</p><p>3 0.34730765 <a title="1719-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-28-The_holes_in_my_philosophy_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">781 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-28-The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10. Inference about μ is straightforward, as is model checking, whether based on graphs or numerical summaries such as the sample variance and skewn</p><p>4 0.34112251 <a title="1719-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics_%28with_all_the_discussions%21%29.html">1712 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (with all the discussions!)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My article with Cosma Shalizi has appeared in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.  I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.
 
 Here’s the issue of the journal , which also includes an introduction, several discussions, and a rejoinder:

<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>3 0.9315775 <a title="1719-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.

We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.
 
 Here’s the issue of the journal , which also includes an introduction, several discussions, and a rejoinder:

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, in response to some reflections from Steve Hsu, I  wrote  the following:
  
I’ve long been glad that when I went to college in the 80s, I was at MIT rather than Harvard. Either place I would’ve taken hard classes and learned a lot, but one advantage of MIT was that we had no sense–no sense at all–that we could make big bucks. We had no sense of making moderately big bucks as lawyers, no sense of making big bucks working on Wall Street, and no sense of making really big bucks by starting a business. I mean, sure, we knew about lawyers (but we didn’t know that a lawyer with technical skills would be a killer combination), we knew about Wall Street (but we had no idea what they did, other than shout pork belly prices across a big room), and we knew about tech startups (but we had no idea that they were anything to us beyond a source of jobs for engineers). What we were all looking for was a good solid job with cool benefits (like those companies in California that had gy</p><p>2 0.97120917 <a title="1719-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious%3A_Why_We_Evolved_a_Taste_for_Being_Bad.html">1901 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>3 0.97048461 <a title="1719-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-20-Job_opening_at_an_organization_that_promotes_reproducible_research%21.html">1990 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-20-Job opening at an organization that promotes reproducible research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was told about an organization called Reproducibility Initiative.  They tell me they are trying to make what was described in our “50 shades of gray”  post  standard across all of science, particularly areas like cancer research.  I don’t know anything else about them, but that sounds like a good start!

<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>5 0.96824056 <a title="1719-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-21-Value-added_assessment_political_FAIL.html">1274 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-21-Value-added assessment political FAIL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jimmy points me to a  sequence of posts  (Analyzing Released NYC Value-Added Data Parts 1, 2, 3, 4) by Gary Rubinstein slamming value-added assessment of teachers.
 
A skeptical consensus seems to have arisen on this issue.  The teachers groups don’t like the numbers and it seems like none of the reformers trust the numbers enough to defend them.  Lots of people like the  idea  of evaluating teacher performance, but I don’t see anybody out there wanting to seriously defend the numbers that are being pushed out here.
 
P.S.  Just to be clear, I’m specifically addressing the problems arising in value assessment of individual teachers.  I’m not criticizing the interesting research by Jonah Rockoff and others on the distribution of teacher effects.  It’s a lot easier to estimate the distribution of a set of parameters than to estimate the parameters individually.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.9568485 <a title="1719-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-11-Why_waste_time_philosophizing%3F.html">1719 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-11-Why waste time philosophizing?</a></p>

That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.

</p><p>8 Gelman is right that there is a good deal of debate about which days best reflect a high conception risk period, and this is a legitimate criticism of all research that assesses fertility without directly measuring hormone levels. [sent-49, score-0.568]
</p><p>9 We adopted the Day 6-14 categorization period after finding that this is the categorization used by a large body of previously published, well-run studies on conception risk (e. [sent-51, score-0.492]
</p><p>10 Rather, we adopted it a priori and used it and only it in analyzing our data; no researcher degrees of freedom came into play. [sent-58, score-0.477]
</p><p>11 e) In any study that assesses conception risk using a self-report measure, certain women must be excluded to ensure that those for whom risk was not accurately captured do not erroneously influence results. [sent-59, score-0.601]
</p><p>12 The decision of whether to exclude women on the basis of these gray-area criteria does lead to the possibility of researcher degrees of freedom. [sent-64, score-0.555]

</p><p>15 He could, and should, instead find out exactly the places where researcher degrees of freedom did come into play, then calculate the precise likelihood that they would have resulted in the two significant effects that emerged in our studies if these effects were not in fact true.

<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):

<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis.

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.

<p>Introduction: A journalist wrote to me recently:
  
I was going to include your deconstruction of the beautiful daughters paper, but ran out of space. The author, incidentally, stands by that paper — and emailed me that you’d advised him on a later paper, implying that meant you now accepted the thesis!
  
I responded:
  
I know that Kanazawa stands by his earlier claim.  Unfortunately, in this case, “stands by” means believing something with no evidence. And, yes, he send me a copy of his other paper, and I responded by telling him I thought his sample size is too small.  I did advise him, and my advice was to not do it!
  
To avoid any future confusion, I thought I’d post my half of my emails with Kanazawa over the years:

Dear Dr. Kanazawa,


I read with interest your papers on sex ratios in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.  Sex ratios are an inherently interesting topic and also a favorite example for people such as myself who teach probability and statistics.

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>2 0.97423935 <a title="1963-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-%28Partisan%29_visualization_of_health_care_legislation.html">178 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-(Partisan) visualization of health care legislation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Congressman  Kevin Brady  from Texas  distributes this visualization of reformed  health care  in the US (click for a bigger picture):
 
   
 
Here’s a  PDF  at Brady’s page, and a local  copy  of it.
 
Complexity has its costs. Beyond the cost of writing it, learning it, following it, there’s also the cost of checking it. John Walker has some  funny examples  of what’s hidden in the almost 8000 pages of IRS code.
 
Text mining and applied statistics will solve all that, hopefully. Anyone interested in developing a pork detection system for the legislation? Or an analysis of how much entropy to the legal code did each congressman contribute?
 
There are already  spin   detectors , that help you detect whether the writer is a Democrat (“stimulus”, “health care”) or a Republican (“deficit spending”, “ObamaCare”).

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>4 0.9579165 <a title="1963-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-02-%E2%80%9CA_Christmas_Carol%E2%80%9D_as_applied_to_plagiarism.html">1440 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-02-“A Christmas Carol” as applied to plagiarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mashey sends me this delightful video (not in English but it has subtitles) from the University of Bergen (link comes from  this page  from Elsevier but I don’t see any direct connection between the controversial academic publisher and the Bergen group).
 
Part of me believes, deep down, that if someone were to send this link to  Edward Wegman , he will repent, that he’ll just break down, confess, and apologize to everybody involved.
 
I can’t understand the psychology of such people.  I mean, I can understand someone being lazy enough to plagiarize and to deny if accused.  But to keep denying after you’ve been caught and everyone knows you did it—I simply can’t see how someone can do that.
 
But this surely reflects my nerd-like lack of understanding of human nature, more than anything else.  It’s a bit scary that someone such as myself who has such poor intuitions about human behavior can become a prominent social scientist, but I suppose it takes all kinds.

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

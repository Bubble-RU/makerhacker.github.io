I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.

<p>Introduction: I’ll answer the above question after first sharing some background and history on the the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, which appeared at the end of our  rejoinder  to the discussion to which I  linked  the other day:
  
When we were beginning our statistical educations, the word ‘Bayesian’ conveyed membership in an obscure cult. Statisticians who were outside the charmed circle could ignore the Bayesian subfield, while Bayesians themselves tended to be either apologetic or brazenly defiant. These two extremes manifested themselves in ever more elaborate proposals for non-informative priors, on the one hand, and declarations of the purity of subjective probability, on the other.


Much has changed in the past 30 years. ‘Bayesian’ is now often used in casual scientific parlance as a synonym for ‘rational’, the anti-Bayesians have mostly disappeared, and non-Bayesian statisticians feel the need to keep up with developments in Bayesian modelling and computation.

The location of the talk will not be convenient for most of you, but anyone who comes to the trouble of showing up will have the opportunity to laugh at my accent.
 
P.S.  For those of you who are interested in the topic but can’t make it to the talk, I recommend these two papers on my non-inductive Bayesian philosophy:

<p>Introduction: Here’s an article  that I believe is flat-out entertaining to read.  It’s about philosophy, so it’s supposed to be entertaining, in any case.
 
Here’s the abstract:
  
A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.






Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but</p><p>5 0.31817618 <a title="1712-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and Gordon Brittan  write :
  
We introduce a distinction, unnoticed in the literature, between four varieties of objective Bayesianism. What we call ‘strong objective Bayesianism’ is characterized by two claims, that all scientific inference is ‘logical’ and that, given the same background information two agents will ascribe a unique probability to their priors. We think that neither of these claims can be sustained; in this sense, they are ‘dogmatic’. The first fails to recognize that some scientific inference, in particular that concerning evidential relations, is not (in the appropriate sense) logical, the second fails to provide a non-question-begging account of ‘same background information’. We urge that a suitably objective Bayesian account of scientific inference does not require either of the claims. Finally, we argue that Bayesianism needs to be fine-grained in the same way that Bayesians fine-grain their beliefs.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>6 0.86987919 <a title="1712-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-05-An_unexpected_benefit_of_Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">746 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-05-An unexpected benefit of Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>2 0.98281002 <a title="1712-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-06-Suspicious_pattern_of_too-strong_replications_of_medical_research.html">700 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-06-Suspicious pattern of too-strong replications of medical research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes  in the Statistics Forum:
  
The Chinese scientific literature is rarely read or cited outside of China. But the authors of this work are usually knowledgeable of the non-Chinese literature — at least the A-list journals. And so they too try to replicate the alpha finding. But do they? One would think that they would find the same diminished effect size, but they don’t! Instead they replicate the original result, even larger.  Here’s one of the graphs:

<p>Introduction: So, I’m at MIT, twenty minutes into my  talk  on tradeoffs in information graphics to the computer scientists, when the power goes out.  They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.  It went well, perhaps better than the actual talk would’ve gone, even though they didn’t get to see most of my  slides .</p><p>4 0.98058611 <a title="1712-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-24-Always_check_your_evidence.html">1025 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-24-Always check your evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Logical reasoning typically takes the following form:
 
1.  I know that A is true. 
2.  I know that A implies B. 
3.  Therefore, I can conclude that B is true.
 
I, like Lewis Carroll, have  problems  with this process sometimes, but it’s pretty standard.
 
There is also a statistical version in which the above statements are replaced by averages (“A usually happens,” etc.).
 
But in all these stories, the argument can fall down if you get the facts wrong.  Perhaps that’s one reason that statisticians can be obsessed with detail. 
   
For example, David Brooks wrote the following, in a  column  called “Living with Mistakes”:
  
The historian Leslie Hannah identified the ten largest American companies in 1912. None of those companies ranked in the top 100 companies by 1990.
  
Huh?  Could that really be?  I googled “ten largest american companies 1912″ and found  this , from Leslie Hannah:
 
  
 
No big deal:  two still in the top 10 rather than zero in the top 100, but Brooks’s general</p><p>5 0.97970366 <a title="1712-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-23-Modeling_heterogenous_treatment_effects.html">2 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-23-Modeling heterogenous treatment effects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Don Green and Holger Kern write  on one of my  favorite topics , treatment interactions (see also  here ):
  
We [Green and Kern] present a methodology that largely automates the search for systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in large-scale experiments. We introduce a nonparametric estimator developed in statistical learning, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), to model treatment effects that vary as a function of covariates. BART has several advantages over commonly employed parametric modeling strategies, in particular its ability to automatically detect and model relevant treatment-covariate interactions in a flexible manner.


To increase the reliability and credibility of the resulting conditional treatment effect estimates, we suggest the use of a split sample design. The data are randomly divided into two equally-sized parts, with the first part used to explore treatment effect heterogeneity and the second part used to confirm the results. This approach permits a re</p><p>6 0.97889829 <a title="1712-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-02-Reintegrating_rebels_into_civilian_life%3A_Quasi-experimental_evidence_from_Burundi.html">177 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-02-Reintegrating rebels into civilian life: Quasi-experimental evidence from Burundi</a></p>

Johns Hopkins University Post-Doctoral Fellow Opening


The Department of Mental Health invites applications for a post-doctoral research fellow in Statistical Methods for Mental Health Research, to be supervised by Dr. Elizabeth Stuart.  The successful applicant for this position will work on an NIH funded study to develop and evaluate propensity score methods when the covariates are measured with error, or when datasets contain similar, but not identical, measures of covariates of interest.  The post-doc will work with a team of researchers on development of new statistical methods, analysis of existing data, Monte Carlo simulations, and will take the lead on scientific publications.  Opportunities will be provided for training in causal inference, missing data, latent variable methods, the evaluation of statistical methods, and the application of statistics to mental health and education.  The three particular motivating examples will be: earl</p><p>3 0.18300302 <a title="1794-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-25-My_talk_at_Stanford_on_Tuesday.html">679 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-25-My talk at Stanford on Tuesday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: See if you can interpolate the talk from the  slides .
 
The background is:  I was invited to speak in this seminar on “big data.”  I said I didn’t know anything about big data, I worked on little data.  They said that was ok.  Actually it was probably a crowd-pleasing move to tell these people that little-data ideas remain relevant.</p><p>5 0.15084064 <a title="1794-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-My_talk_midtown_this_Friday_noon_%28and_at_Columbia_Monday_afternoon%29.html">1821 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-My talk midtown this Friday noon (and at Columbia Monday afternoon)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue (between 34th and 35th street), room 6002.  The topic:   causality and statistical learning .  Announcement is  here  (scroll down).  It says that if you would like to attend any event, please respond by emailing datamining@gc.cuny.edu
 
I’m also giving a shorter talk on the same topic in the Sustainable Development Seminar  Series  4pm Monday 29 Apr in room 407 International Affairs Bldg (at 118th St. and Amsterdam Ave.).
 
It’s just a coincidence that I’m giving the same talk twice.  I was asked at different times to speak for these groups.

 Tues :  Understanding Simpson’s paradox using a graph
 
 Wed :  Advice: positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum
 
 Thurs :  Small multiples of lineplots > maps (ok, not always, but yes in this case)
 
 Fri :  “More research from the lunatic fringe”
 
 Sat :  “Schools of statistical thoughts are sometimes jokingly likened to religions. This analogy is not perfect—unlike religions, statistical methods have no supernatural content and make essentially no demands on our personal lives. Looking at the comparison from the other direction, it is possible to be agnostic, atheistic, or simply live one’s life without religion, but it is not really possible to do statistics without some philosophy.”

When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>3 0.96815038 <a title="1794-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>4 0.9582417 <a title="1794-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-19-Statistical_discrimination_again.html">1541 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-19-Statistical discrimination again</a></p>

I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?


One proposal has been to fit ‘black boxes’ into cars so more individual data can be collected, as opposed to relying heavily on aggregates.

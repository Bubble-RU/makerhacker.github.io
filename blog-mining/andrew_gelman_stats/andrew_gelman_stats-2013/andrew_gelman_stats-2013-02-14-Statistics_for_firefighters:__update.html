Curious if you’ve looked at the  current debate  about Tesla fires, statistically speaking. Lots of arm-waving about true/sample proportions, sample sizes, normal approximations, etc. 


Would love to see a blog post if it intrigues you at all.
  
I hadn’t heard about this at all!  I mean, sure, I’d heard of Tesla, this is an electric car being built by some  eccentric billionaire .  But I didn’t know they were catching on fire!  At this point I  was  curious so I followed the link.
 
It was an interesting discussion to read, partly because some of the commenters were so open about their financial interests;  for example ,
  
i felt like now is a good time to share some of my insights, specifically regarding the tesla fires. i know many people won’t like to hear what i have to say. and i don’t have a longer term holding in tesla any more, although sometimes i day-trade tesla from the long or short side. tesla has been kind to me, both as an investor and model s</p><p>3 0.13204692 <a title="1722-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Estimating_and_reporting_teacher_effectivenss%3A__Newspaper_researchers_do_things_that_academic_researchers_never_could.html">222 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Estimating and reporting teacher effectivenss:  Newspaper researchers do things that academic researchers never could</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  reports  on  an analysis  from the Los Angeles Times of teacher performance (as measured by so-called value-added analysis, which is basically compares teachers based on their students’ average test scores at the end of the year, after controlling for pre-test scores.
 
It’s well known that some teachers are much better than others, but, as Alex points out, what’s striking about the L.A. Times study is that they are publishing the estimates for  individual teachers .  For example, this:
 
 
 
Nice graphics, too.
  

 
To me, this illustrates one of the big advantages of research in a non-academic environment.  If you’re writing an article for the L.A. Times, you can do what you want (within the limits of the law).  If you’re doing the same research study at a university, there are a million restrictions.  For example, from an  official documen t, “The primary purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participati</p><p>4 0.12641178 <a title="1722-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-12-Probability_of_successive_wins_in_baseball.html">29 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-12-Probability of successive wins in baseball</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein did an  informal study  asking people the following question:
  
When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days, what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game?
  
You can make your own guess and the continue reading below.
    
Dan writes:
  
We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting. The answers came in between 65% and 70%.






The true answer [based on Dan's analysis of a database of baseball games]: 51.3%, a little better than a coin toss.
  
I have to say, I’m surprised his colleagues gave such extreme guesses.  I was guessing something like 50%, myself, based on the following very crude reasoning:
 
Suppose two unequal teams are playing, and the chance of team A beating team B is 55%.  (This seems like a reasonable average of all matchups, which will include some more extreme disparities but also many more equal contests.)  Then the chance of the same team</p><p>5 0.12576015 <a title="1722-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-01-%E2%80%9COn_Inspiring_Students_and_Being_Human%E2%80%9D.html">1517 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-01-“On Inspiring Students and Being Human”</a></p>

Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

Looking at the “typical” ML syllabus, I think most classes do a great job teaching the core ideas, but that there’re two recent trends in ML that are usually not yet reflected. 


First, unlike 10 years ago, a lot of our students are now taking ML not to do ML research, but to apply it in other research areas or in  industry.  I’d like to serve these students as well.  While many ML classes do a nice job teaching the theory and core algorithms, I’ve seen very few that teach the “hands-on” tactics for how to actually build a high-performance ML system, or on how to think about piecing together a complex ML architecture.  For example, what sorts of diagnostics do you run to figure out why your algorithm isn’t giving reasonable accuracy?  How much do you invest in collecting additional training data?  How do you structure your org chart and metrics if you think there’re 3 components that need to be built and plugged</p><p>4 0.80298495 <a title="1722-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-01-%E2%80%9COn_Inspiring_Students_and_Being_Human%E2%80%9D.html">1517 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-01-“On Inspiring Students and Being Human”</a></p>

focused on the mantra of “do not repeat yourself”. In day one you will 
learn powerful new tools of abstraction, allowing you to solve a wider 
range of problems with fewer lines of code. Day two will teach you how 
to make packages, the fundamental unit of code distribution in R, 
allowing others to save time by allowing them to use your code.


To get the most out of this course, you should have some experience 
programming in R already: you should be familiar with writing 
functions, and the basic data structures of R: vectors, matrices, 
arrays, lists and data frames. You will find the course particularly 
useful if you’re an experienced R user looking to take the next step, 
or if you’re moving to R from other programming languages and you want 
to quickly get up to speed with R’s unique features. A coupl</p><p>6 0.79553199 <a title="1722-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-29-Data_mining_and_allergies.html">685 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-29-Data mining and allergies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  earlier  discussion, Daniel Rubenson from Ryerson University in Toronto writes:
  
The course went really well (it was a couple of years ago now). The course was run through a partnership my department has with the Ontario Fire College. Basically, firefighters can do a certificate and sometimes a degree in public administration and part of that is a course on methods. It was a small group — about 8 or so — very motivated guys (all guys). Some of them were chiefs or deputy chiefs from small towns, others captains who were doing the certificate in order to improve their chances for promotion or as a step into a broader public admin career. 


I had asked them ahead of time to bring with them whatever data they could get their hands on and that they thought would be interesting. This included response times, data on professional v voluntary firefighters, some insurance data and the like.

I’m looking for your input!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve recently started a regular column on ethics, appearing every three months in  Chance magazine .  My first column, “Open Data and Open Methods,” is  here , and my second column, “Statisticians:  When we teach, we don’t practice what we preach” (coauthored with Eric Loken) will be appearing in the next issue.
 
Statistical ethics is a wide-open topic, and I’d be very interested in everyone’s thoughts, questions, and stories.  I’d like to get beyond generic questions such as, Is it right to do a randomized trial when you think the treatment is probably better than the control?, and I’d also like to avoid the really easy questions such as, Is it ethical to copy Wikipedia entries and then sell the resulting publication for  $2800  a year?  [Note to people who are sick of hearing about this particular story:  I'll consider stopping my blogging on it, the moment that the people involved consider apologizing for their behavior.]

I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Illinois. . . . My main work is in supply chain area, and empirical in nature. . . . I am working with a firm that has two separate divisions – one making cars, and the other makes trucks. Four years back, the firm made an interesting organizational change. They created a separate group of ~25 engineers, in their car division (from within their quality and production engineers). This group was focused on improving supplier quality and reported to car plant head . The truck division did not (and still does not) have such an independent “supplier improvement group”. Other than this unit in car, the organizational arrangements in the two divisions mimic each other.  There are many common suppliers to the car and truck division.


Data on quality of components coming from suppliers has been collected (for the last four years). The organizational change happened in January 2007.

I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>6 0.96611571 <a title="1722-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-12-Do_you_ever_have_that_I-just-fit-a-model_feeling%3F.html">2018 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-12-Do you ever have that I-just-fit-a-model feeling?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This recent story  of a wacky psychology professor reminds me of  this old story  of a wacky psychology professor.
 
 This story  of a wacky philosophy professor reminds me of a course I almost took at MIT.  I was looking through the course catalog one day and saw that Thomas Kuhn was teaching a class in the philosophy of science.  Thomas Kuhn–wow!  So I enrolled in the class.  I only sat through one session before dropping it, though.  Kuhn just stood up there and mumbled.
 
At the time, this annoyed me a little.  In retrospect, though, it made more sense.  I’m sure he felt he had better things to do with his life than teach classes.  And MIT was paying him whether or not he did a good job teaching, so it’s not like he was breaking his contract or anything.  (Given the range of instructors we had at MIT, it was always a good idea to make use of the shopping period at the beginning of the semester.  I had some amazing classes but only one or two really bad ones.  Mostly I dropped the b</p><p>3 0.14408892 <a title="1709-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-21-If_your_comment_didn%E2%80%99t_get_through_._._..html">425 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-21-If your comment didn’t get through . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  a recent article , “Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems,” by fisheries researchers George Sugihara, Robert May, Hao Ye, Chih-hao Hsieh, Ethan Deyle, Michael Fogarty, and Stephan Munch.
 
I don’t know anything about ecology research but I could imagine this method being useful in that field.  I can’t see the approach doing much in political science, where I think their stated goal of “identifying causal networks” is typically irrelevant.
 
That said, if you replace the word “causality” by “predictability” everywhere in the paper, it starts to make a lot more sense.  As they write, they are working within “a framework that uses predictability as opposed to correlation to identify causation between time-series variables.”  Setting causation aside, predictability is an important topic in itself.  The search for patterns of predictability in complex structures may motivate causal hypotheses that can be studied more directly, using more traditional statis</p><p>5 0.13752846 <a title="1709-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-Note_to_%E2%80%9CCigarettes%E2%80%9D.html">132 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-Note to “Cigarettes”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A commenter wrote (by email):
  
I’ve noticed that you’ve quit approving my comments on your blog.  I hope I didn’t anger you in some way or write something you felt was inappropriate.
  
My reply:
 
I have not been unapproving any comments.  If you have comments that have not appeared, they have probably been going into the spam filter.  I get literally thousands of spam comments a day and so anything that hits the spam filter is gone forever.

<p>Introduction: I have to go through the inbox to approve new comments.  When I set to auto-approve, I get overwhelmed with spam.  As is, I still get spam but it’s manageable.
 
Usually the spam is uninteresting but this one caught my eye:
 
   
 
At first this seemed reasonable enough:  law firm is desperate for business, spams blogs to raise its Google ranking.  But what’s with the writing in the actual comment?  It’s incoherent but it doesn’t look computer-generated.  My guess is that the law firm in Massachusetts hired a company that promised to raise their Google rankings, and that this company hired some non-English-speaking foreigners to search through the web and write some spam comments.  If anyone actually reads the comments, they might get the impression that this law firm is staffed by illiterates . . . but, as we all know, nobody reads blog comments!

I stumbled across your  blog entry  after googling on those terms. 


If I could comment on the closed entry [We had to shut off comments on old blog entries for reasons of spam --- ed.], I’d note: scientific revolutions are fractal; they’re also chaotic in their dynamics. Predictability when a particular scientific revolution will take hold—or be rejected—is problematic. I find myself wishing that Chaos Theory had been established when Kuhn wrote his essay.</p><p>2 0.83726215 <a title="1709-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-Bayes_in_astronomy.html">1091 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-Bayes in astronomy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Schminovich points me to  this paper  by Yu Lu, H. Mo, Martin Weinberg, and Neal Katz:
  
We believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape the observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions. The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. . . .
  
And here’s  another  from the same authors, this time on “Bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the K-band luminosity function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation.”

 Learning to Read All Over Again  
Lutz Koepnick 
What produces better students – reading in print or reading on-line? The answer is both.


 The Elusive Quest for Research Innovation  
Claude S. Fischer 
Much of what is considered “new research” has actually been around for a while. But that does not mean it lacks value.


 Science Journalism and the Art of Expressing Uncertainty  
Andrew Gelman 
It is all too easy for unsupported claims to get published in scientific publications. How can journalists address this?


 A Scientist Goes Rogue  
Euny Hong 
Can social media and crowdfunding sustain independent researchers?


 Still Waiting for Change  
Sylvia A. Allegretto 
Economists and policymakers alike are ignoring a huge class of workers whose wages have been effectively frozen for decades.

<p>Introduction: John Horton points to  Sims ‘s  comment on Angrist and Pischke :
  
Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)
 
P.S.  I’m still miffed that this journal didn’t invite  me  to comment on that article!</p><p>5 0.79322243 <a title="1709-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-25-Plaig.html">1738 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-25-Plaig</a></p>

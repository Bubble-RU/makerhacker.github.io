<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Dave Decker writes:
  
I’ve seen some Bayes related things recently that might make for interesting fodder on your blog.


There are two books, teaching Bayesian analysis from a programming perspective.


And also a “web application for data analysis using powerful Bayesian statistical methods.”
  
   
I took a look.  The first book is  Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics Made Simple, by Allen B. Downey .  It’s super readable and, amazingly, has approximately zero overlap with Bayesian Data Analysis.  Downey discusses lots of little problems in a conversational way.  In some ways it’s like an old-style math stat textbook (although with a programming rather than mathematical flavor) in that the examples are designed for simplicity rather than realism.  I like it!  Our book already exists; it’s good to have something else for people to read, coming from an entirely different perspective.
 
The second book is  Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers , by Cameron Davidson-P</p><p>5 0.12841836 <a title="2106-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-NYC_Data_Skeptics_Meetup.html">1837 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-NYC Data Skeptics Meetup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt writes:
  
The hype surrounding Big Data and Data Science is at a fever pitch with promises to solve the worldâ&euro;&trade;s business and social problems, large and small. How accurate or misleading is this message? How is it helping or damaging people, and which people? What opportunities exist for data nerds and entrepreneurs that examine the larger issues with a skeptical view?


 This Meetup  focuses on mathematical, ethical, and business aspects of data from a skeptical perspective. Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling. We will take deep dives into models in the fields of Data Science, statistics, financial engineering, and economics.

<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>3 0.80205482 <a title="2106-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-01-Doing_Data_Science%3A__What%E2%80%99s_it_all_about%3F.html">2084 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-01-Doing Data Science:  What’s it all about?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Geen Tomko asks:
  
Can you recommend a good introductory book for statistical computation? Mostly, something that would help make it easier in collecting and analyzing data from student test scores.
  
I don’t know.  Usually, when people ask for a starter statistics book, my recommendation (beyond my own books) is The Statistical Sleuth.  But that’s not really a computation book.  ARM isn’t really a statistical computation book either.  But the statistical computation books that I’ve seen don’t seems so relevant for the analyses that Tomko is looking for.  For example, the R book of Venables and Ripley focuses on nonparametric statistics, which is fine but seems a bit esoteric for these purposes.
 
Does anyone have any suggestions?</p><p>5 0.79307568 <a title="2106-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-26-I_need_a_title_for_my_book_on_ethics_and_statistics%21%21.html">1590 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-26-I need a title for my book on ethics and statistics!!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Ethics and Statistics” is descriptive but boring.  It sounds like the textbook for a course which, unfortunately, nobody will take.
 
“Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics” is too unoriginal.
 
“How to Lie, Cheat, and Steal With Statistics” is kind of ok, maybe?
 
“Statistical Dilemmas”:  maybe a bit too boring as well.
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Statistics, and Some Guys Who’ve Skated a Bit Close to the Edge”:  Hmmm….
 
Maybe we have to get “statistics” out of the title altogether?
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Data Science”?
 
“Date Science and Data Fraud”?
 
“10 Things You Really Really Really Shouldn’t Do With Numbers”?
 
And, if no better idea comes along, there’s always “Evilicious:  Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad.”  (Regular readers will know what I’m talking about here; the rest of you can google it.)
 
Or maybe just “The Wegman Report”?
 
It’s  hard  to come up with a good title. Even  John Updike  had difficulties in this regard.

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein asks for my thoughts as  a Bayesian on the above topic.  So here they are (briefly):
 
The concept of the bias-variance tradeoff can be useful if you don’t take it too seriously.  The basic idea is as follows:  if you’re estimating something, you can slice your data finer and finer, or perform more and more adjustments, each time getting a purer—and less biased—estimate.  But each subdivision or each adjustment reduces your sample size or increases potential estimation error, hence the variance of your estimate goes up.
 
That story is real.  In lots and lots of examples, there’s a continuum between a completely unadjusted general estimate (high bias, low variance) and a specific, focused, adjusted estimate (low bias, high variance).
 
Suppose, for example, you’re using data from a large experiment to estimate the effect of a treatment on a fairly narrow group, say, white men between the ages of 45 and 50.  At one extreme, you could just take the estimated treatment e</p><p>2 0.97434664 <a title="2106-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-13-Coauthorship_norms.html">609 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-13-Coauthorship norms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I followed  this link  from Chris Blattman to  an article  by economist Roland Fryer, who writes:
  
I [Fryer] find no evidence that teacher incentives increase student performance, attendance, or graduation, nor do I find any evidence that the incentives change student or teacher behavior.
  
What struck me were not the findings (which, as Fryer notes in his article, are plausible enough) but the use of the word “I” rather than “we.”  A field experiment is a big deal, and I was surprised to read that Fryer did it all by himself!
 
Here’s the note of acknowledgments (on the first page of the article):

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, upon the selection of Sarah Palin as vice-presidential nominee, I made some graphs of the popularity of governors of different-sized states:
 
 
 
As I wrote  at the time :
 
It seems to be easier to maintain high approval in a small state. What’s going on? Some theories: in a large state, there will be more ambitious politicians on the other side, eager to knock off the incumbent governor; small states often have part-time legislatures and thus the governor is involved in less political conflict; small states (notably Alaska) tend to get more funds per capita from the federal government, and it’s easier to be popular when you can disburse more funds; large states tend to be more heterogeneous and so it’s harder to keep all the voters happy.
 
I was curious how things have been going more recently, and Hanfei made an updated graph using data from  this archive .  Here’s the story:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  discusses  his and Bryan Caplan’s reaction to that notorious book by Amy Chua, the Yale law professor who boasts of screaming at her children, calling them “garbage,” not letting them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano, etc.  Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel.  Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes).

<p>Introduction: Last night I spoke at the Columbia Club of New York, along with some of my political science colleagues, in a  panel  about politics, the economy, and the forthcoming election.  The discussion was fine . . . until one guy in the audience accused us of bias based on what he imputed as our ethnicity.  One of the panelists replied by asking the questioner what of all the things we had said was biased, and the questioner couldn’t actually supply any examples.
 
It makes sense that the questioner couldn’t come up with a single example of bias on our part, considering that we were actually presenting  facts .
 
At some level, the questioner’s imputation of our ethnicity and accusation of bias isn’t so horrible.  When talking with my friends, I engage in casual ethnic stereotyping all the time–hey, it’s a free country!–and one can certainly make the  statistical  argument that you can guess people’s ethnicities from their names, appearance, and speech patterns, and in turn you can infer a lot</p><p>6 0.9702177 <a title="2106-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics_%28with_all_the_discussions%21%29.html">1712 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-07-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (with all the discussions!)</a></p>

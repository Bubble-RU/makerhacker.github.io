If I could comment on the closed entry [We had to shut off comments on old blog entries for reasons of spam --- ed.], I’d note: scientific revolutions are fractal; they’re also chaotic in their dynamics. Predictability when a particular scientific revolution will take hold—or be rejected—is problematic.

<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>4 0.12308913 <a title="1802-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-10-%E2%80%9CCausality_is_almost_always_in_doubt%E2%80%9D.html">950 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-10-“Causality is almost always in doubt”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Backus writes:
  
We macroeconomists are thrilled with the Nobel prize for Sargent and Sims.  But on causality:  they spent more time showing how hard it was to identify causality than showing how to do it.  And that’s a fair assessment of our field [economics]: causality is almost always in doubt.
  
More  here .
 
If I were in a snarky mood, I’d say something like, Causality is always in doubt in economics . . . unless you’re talking about abortion and crime, in which case you can be absolutely certain.
 
But I’m in a good mood right now so I won’t say that.  Instead I’ll just remark that, as a statistician, I’m positively thrilled that somebody named “Sims” received a major award.</p><p>5 0.12152365 <a title="1802-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-16-Long_discussion_about_causal_inference_and_the_use_of_hierarchical_models_to_bridge_between_different_inferential_settings.html">1418 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-16-Long discussion about causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent.

<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>4 0.77102745 <a title="1802-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-24-All_inference_is_about_generalizing_from_sample_to_population.html">1996 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-24-All inference is about generalizing from sample to population</a></p>

Your blog has skirted around the value of observational studies and chided folks for using causal language when they only have associations but I sense that you ultimately find value in these associations. I would love for you to expand this thought in a blog. Specifically:


Does a measured association “suggest” a causal relationship? Are measured associations a good and efficient way to narrow the field of things that should be studied? Of all the things we should pursue, should we start with the stuff that has some largish measured association? Certainly many associations are not directly causal but due to joint association. Similarly, there must be many variables that are directly causally associated ( A -> B) but the effect, measured as an association, is masked by confounders. So if we took the “measured associations are worthwhile” approach, we’d never or rarely find the masked effects. But I’d also like to know if one is more likely to find a large causal</p><p>5 0.75353783 <a title="1802-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-08-Understanding_Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_using_a_graph.html">2286 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-08-Understanding Simpson’s paradox using a graph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein pointed me to  this  post by Michael Nielsen on how to teach Simpson’s paradox.
 
I don’t know if Nielsen (and others) are aware that people have developed some snappy graphical methods for displaying Simpson’s paradox (and, more generally, aggregation issues).  We do some this in our Red State Blue State book, but before that was the BK plot,  named by Howard Wainer  after a 2001 paper by Stuart Baker and Barnett Kramer, although in apparently appeared earlier in a 1987 paper by Jeon, Chung, and Bae, and doubtless was made by various other people before then.
 
Here’s Wainer’s graphical explication from 2002 (adapted from Baker and Kramer’s 2001 paper):
 
 
 
   
Here’s the version from our 2007 article (with Boris Shor, Joe Bafumi, and David Park):
 
 
 
But I recommend  Wainer’s article  (linked to above) as the first thing to read on the topic of presenting aggregation paradoxes in a clear and grabby way.

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

<p>Introduction: Tapen Sinha writes:
  
Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.
  
 The paper  appeared in the journal Health Policy.  From the abstract:

My brief feedback is that water is confounded with these results. They should have subtracted water content from the weight of all dietary items, as it inflates the proportion of milk, vegetable and fruit items that contain more water. They did that for soda (which is represented as sugar/corn syrup), amplifying the inconsistency.

<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.
 
Jarno Vanhatalo, Jaakko Riihimäki, Jouni Hartikainen, Pasi Jylänki, Ville Tolvanen, and Aki Vehtari  write :
  
The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.9324221 <a title="1802-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Detecting_predictability_in_complex_ecosystems.html">1802 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Detecting predictability in complex ecosystems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I used to think that fiction is about making up stories, but in recent years I’ve decided that fiction is really more of a method of telling true stories.  One thing fiction allows you to do is explore what-if scenarios.  I recently read two books that made me think about this:  The Counterlife by Philip Roth and Things We Didn’t See Coming by Steven Amsterdam.  Both books are explicitly about contingencies and possibilities:  Roth’s tells a sequence of related but contradictory stories involving his Philip Roth-like (of course) protagonist, and Amsterdam’s is based on an alternative present/future.  (I picture Amsterdam’s book as being set in Australia, but maybe I’m just imagining this based on my knowledge that the book was written and published in that country.)  I found both books fascinating, partly because of the characters’ voices but especially because they both seemed to exemplify George Box’s dictum that to understand a system you have to perturb it.

<p>Introduction: Christopher Uggen  reports .
 
I’m surprised the difference is so small.  I would’ve thought the crime rate was something like 5 times higher in Detroit than in Minneapolis.  I guess Minneapolis must have some rough neighborhoods.  Or maybe it’s just that I don’t have a good framework for thinking about crime statistics.</p><p>5 0.16625071 <a title="1852-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-05-High_temperatures_cause_violent_crime_and_implications_for_climate_change%2C_also_some_suggestions_about_how_to_better_summarize_these_claims.html">1522 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-05-High temperatures cause violent crime and implications for climate change, also some suggestions about how to better summarize these claims</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  writes :
  
I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years. The results tell the aggression story using street-level data very clearly  [click to</p><p>6 0.15958294 <a title="1852-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-17-In_the_best_alternative_histories%2C_the_real_world_is_what%E2%80%99s_ultimately_real.html">2251 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-17-In the best alternative histories, the real world is what’s ultimately real</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joseph Delaney  writes :
  
Is it fair to quote the definition of economics from the blurb for a book?  If so, consider this definition in the blurb for Emily Oster’s new book:

 
When Oster was expecting her first child, she felt powerless to make the right decisions for her pregnancy. How doctors think and what patients need are two very different things. So Oster drew on her own experience and went in search of the real facts about pregnancy using an economist’s tools. Economics is not just a study of finance. It’s the science of determining value and making informed decisions. To make a good decision, you need to understand the information available to you and to know what it means to you as an individual.
 

So, when applied to a medical topic (like pregnancy) how does this differ from evidence based medicine?  Should I be calling myself an economist? 


None of this mean that Emily shouldn’t write this book. My own read on the alcohol and pregnancy angle is that the current advic</p><p>3 0.65780008 <a title="1852-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-21-Responding_to_a_bizarre_anti-social-science_screed.html">1335 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-21-Responding to a bizarre anti-social-science screed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philosophy professor Gary Gutting  writes :
  
Public policy debates often involve appeals to results of work in social sciences like economics and sociology. . . . How much authority should we give to such work in our policy decisions? . . . The core natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) are so well established that we readily accept their best-supported conclusions as definitive. . . . But how reliable is even the best work on the effects of teaching?  How, for example, does it compare with the best work by biochemists on the effects of light on plant growth? Since humans are much more complex than plants and biochemists have far more refined techniques for studying plants, we may well expect the biochemical work to be far more reliable. . . . While the physical sciences produce many detailed and precise predictions, the social sciences do not.
  
OK, fine.  But then comes the punchline:

We macroeconomists are thrilled with the Nobel prize for Sargent and Sims.  But on causality:  they spent more time showing how hard it was to identify causality than showing how to do it.  And that’s a fair assessment of our field [economics]: causality is almost always in doubt.

If I were in a snarky mood, I’d say something like, Causality is always in doubt in economics . . . unless you’re talking about abortion and crime, in which case you can be absolutely certain.
 
But I’m in a good mood right now so I won’t say that.  Instead I’ll just remark that, as a statistician, I’m positively thrilled that somebody named “Sims” received a major award.</p><p>5 0.57846558 <a title="1852-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-08-The_politics_of_economic_and_statistical_models.html">1204 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-08-The politics of economic and statistical models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on  our recent discussion  of the problems of considering utility theory as a foundation for economic analysis (which in turn was a reprise of  this post  from last September), somebody named Mark  pointed  me to a 2007 article by Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden, “The road not taken:  How psychology was removed from economics, and how it might be brought back,” which begins:
  
This article explores parallels between the debate prompted by Pareto’s reformulation of choice theory at the beginning of the twentieth century and current controversies about the status of behavioural economics. Before Pareto’s reformulation, neoclassical economics was based on theoretical and experimental psychology, as behavioural economics now is. Current discovered preference defences of rational-choice theory echo arguments made by Pareto. Both treat economics as a separate science of rational choice, independent of psychology. Both confront two fundamental problems: to find a defensible defi</p><p>6 0.57731563 <a title="1852-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-04-Why_does_anyone_support_private_macroeconomic_forecasts%3F.html">185 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-04-Why does anyone support private macroeconomic forecasts?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following up on  this post  by Noah Smith on economics in science fiction, Mark Palko  writes  on economics in crime fiction.
 
Just as almost all science fiction is ultimately about politics, one could say that just about all crime fiction is about economics.
 
But if I had to pick one crime novelist with an economics focus, Iâ&euro;&trade;d pick George V. Higgins.

But, really, almost all his novels are full of economics.</p><p>5 0.8518461 <a title="1852-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-13-I_like_lineplots.html">800 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-13-I like lineplots</a></p>

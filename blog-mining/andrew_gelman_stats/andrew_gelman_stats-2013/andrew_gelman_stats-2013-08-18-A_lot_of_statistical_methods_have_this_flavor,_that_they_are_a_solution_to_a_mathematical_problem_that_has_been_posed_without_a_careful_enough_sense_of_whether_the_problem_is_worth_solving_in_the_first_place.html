I [Basbøll] feel “entitled”, if that’s the right word (actually, I’d say I feel privileged), to express my opinions to anyone who wants to listen, and while I think it does say something about an author whether or not they answer a question (where what it says depends very much on the quality of the question), I don’t think the author has any obligation to me to respond immediately. If I succeed in raising doubts about something in the minds of many readers, then that’s obviously something an author should take seriously. The point is that an author has a responsibility to the readership of the paper, not any one critic.
  
I agree that the ultimate audience is the scholarly community (and, beyond that, the general public) and that the critic is just serving as a conduit, the person who poses the Q in the Q-and-A.

I’m teaching my first graduate class this semester. It’s intro stats for graduate students in the college of education. Most of the students are first year PhD students. Though, there are a number of master’s students who are primarily in-service teachers. The difficulties with teaching an undergraduate intro stats course are still present, in that mathematical preparation and phobia vary widely across the class.


I’ve been enjoying the class and the students, but I’d like your take on an issue I’ve been thinking about. How do I balance teaching the standard methods, like hypothesis testing, that these future researchers have to know because they are so standard, with discussing the problems with those methods (e.g.  p-value as a measure of sample size , and  the decline effect , not to mention multiple testing and other common mistakes).

<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
I am hoping you can give me some advice about when to use fixed and random effects model. I am currently working on a paper that examines the effect of . . . by comparing states . . .


It got reviewed . . . by three economists and all suggest that we run a fixed effects model.  We ran a hierarchial model in the paper that allow the intercept and slope to vary before and after . . . My question is which is correct? We have ran it both ways and really it makes no difference which model you run, the results are very similar. But for my own learning, I would really like to understand which to use under what circumstances.  Is the fact that we use the whole population reason enough to just run a fixed effect model?


Perhaps you can suggest a good reference to this question of when to run a fixed vs. random effects model.
  
I’m not always sure what is meant by a “fixed effects model”; see my paper on Anova for discussion of the problems with this terminology:

<p>Introduction: Economist Stan Liebowitz has a  longstanding interest  in the difficulties of flagging published research errors.  Recently he wrote on the related topic of dishonest authorship:
  
While not about direct research fraud, I thought you might be interested in  this paper . It discusses the manner in which credit is given for economics articles, and I suspect it applies to many other areas as well. One of the conclusions is that the lack of complete proration per author will lead to excessive coauthorship, reducing overall research output by inducing the use of larger than efficient-sized teams. Under these circumstances, false authorship can be a response to the warped reward system and false authorship might improve research efficiency since it might keep actual research teams (as opposed to nominal teams) from being too large to produce research efficiently. One of the questions I rhetorically ask in the paper is whether anyone has ever been ‘punished’ for having their name included on</p><p>3 0.76625967 <a title="1987-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-11-One_more_time_on_that_ESP_study%3A__The_problem_of_overestimates_and_the_shrinkage_solution.html">511 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-11-One more time on that ESP study:  The problem of overestimates and the shrinkage solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Benedict Carey  writes  a follow-up article on ESP studies and Bayesian statistics.  ( See here  for my previous thoughts on the topic.)  Everything Carey writes is fine, and he even uses an example I recommended:
  
The statistical approach that has dominated the social sciences for almost a century is called significance testing. The idea is straightforward. A finding from any well-designed study — say, a correlation between a personality trait and the risk of depression — is considered “significant” if its probability of occurring by chance is less than 5 percent.


This arbitrary cutoff makes sense when the effect being studied is a large one — for example, when measuring the so-called Stroop effect. This effect predicts that naming the color of a word is faster and more accurate when the word and color match (“red” in red letters) than when they do not (“red” in blue letters), and is very strong in almost everyone.


“But if the true effect of what you are measuring is small,” sai</p><p>4 0.76054108 <a title="1987-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-25-Classics_of_statistics.html">109 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-25-Classics of statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert is  planning  a graduate seminar in which students read 15 classic articles of statistics.  (See  here  for more details and a slightly different list.)
 
Actually, he just writes “classics,” but based on his list, I assume he only wants articles, not books.  If he wanted to include classic books, I’d nominate the following, just for starters: 
- Fisher’s Statistical Methods for Research Workers 
- Snedecor and Cochran’s Statistical Methods 
- Kish’s Survey Sampling 
- Box, Hunter, and Hunter’s Statistics for Experimenters 
- Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Cleveland’s The Elements of Graphing Data 
- Mosteller and Wallace’s book on the Federalist Papers. 
Probably Cox and Hinkley, too.  That’s a book that I don’t think has aged well, but it seems to have had a big influence.
 
I think there’s a lot more good and accessible material in these classic books than in the equivalent volume of classic articles.  Journal articles can be difficult to read and are typicall</p><p>5 0.75515813 <a title="1987-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-With_a_bit_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_again_on_this_topic%2C_and_with_a_lot_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_today.html">576 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-With a bit of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post again on this topic, and with a lot of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post today</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Masse points me to  this response  by Daryl Bem and two statisticians (Jessica Utts and Wesley Johnson) to criticisms by Wagenmakers et.al. of Bem’s recent ESP study.  I have nothing to add but would like to repeat a couple bits of my discussions of last month, of  here :
  
Classical statistical methods that work reasonably well when studying moderate or large effects (see the work of Fisher, Snedecor, Cochran, etc.) fall apart in the presence of small effects.


I think it’s naive when people implicitly assume that the study’s claims are correct, or the study’s statistical methods are weak. Generally, the smaller the effects you’re studying, the better the statistics you need. ESP is a field of small effects and so ESP researchers use high-quality statistics.


To put it another way: whatever methodological errors happen to be in the paper in question, probably occur in lots of researcher papers in “legitimate” psychology research.

A colleague recently forwarded to me your 2012  paper  with Hill and Yajima on the multiple comparison “non-problem”, as I call it.


You and your colleagues might find of interest  a 2012 paper  [with Celia Lombardi] that reaches similar conclusions by a colleague and myself which is attached. Similar but not identical, as we are a bit Bayesian-shy after seeing so many exaggerated claims made for Bayesian approaches over recent decades. 


I take pride in having for a few decades defended many colleagues against editors (and many graduate students against faculty members) who demanded “corrections” for multiple comparisons. We’ve gotten no small number of editors and professors to back off their unreasonable demands. Paper tigers all!

I teach a high school (grade 11) statistics class outside the USA and I am always looking for hands-on demonstrations.  In fact, last week (the start of our school year here), I did the in-class exercise about “guessing ages of ten pictures” (p. 11-13) from your  book  “Teaching Statistics – A Bag of Tricks”.


I am interested in using the “candy weighing”  demonstration  (p. 120-121) to talk about random sampling.


I agree with your advice (p.48, Sec 5.1) that it’s better to have students do sampling from actual populations.  I also agree with your suggestion that actual doing personal interviews is not an effective use of time, except for larger projects.


To that end, can you suggest some sources of actual population data that I could use in class?  As I am outside the USA (in Thailand), we do not have phonebooks here.  Certainly, this must soon be a problem for people in the USA with phonebooks going the way of the 8-track tape.

<p>Introduction: Hi Andrew,


I came across your site while searching for blogs and posts around American obesity and wanted to reach out to get your readership’s feedback on an infographic my team built which focuses on the obesity of America and where we could end up at the going rate.


If you’re interested, let’s connect. Have a great weekend!


Thanks.

I’m helping a professor out with an analysis, and I was hoping that you might be able to point me to some relevant literature…  She has two studies that have been completed already (so we can’t go back to the planning stage in terms of sampling, unfortunately).  Both studies are based around the population of adults in LA who attended LA public high schools at some point, so that is the same for both studies.  Study #1 uses random digit dialing, so I consider that one to be SRS.  Study #2, however, is a convenience sample in which all participants were involved with one of eight community-based organizations (CBOs).


Of course, both studies can be analyzed independently, but she was hoping for there to be some way to combine/compare the two studies.  Specifically, I am working on looking at the civic engagement of the adults in both studies.  In study #1, this means looking at factors such as involvement in student government.

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.

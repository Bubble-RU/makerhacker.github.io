<p>Introduction: Kyle Peyton writes:
  
I’m passing you this  recent  news article by Ewen Callaway in the hope that you will make a comment about the methodology on your blog.  It’s generated some  back and forth  between the economics and science communities.


I [Peyton] am very sceptical of the reductive approach taken by the economics profession generally, and the normative implications this kind of research generates. For example, p. 7 of the  working paper  states: “…[according to our model] decreasing the diversity of the most diverse country in the sample (Ethopia) by 1 percentage point would raise its income per capita by 21 percent”. Understandably, this piece is couched in assumptions that would take hours to pick apart, but their discussion of the approach belies the uncertainty involved. The main response by the authors in defense is that genetic diversity is a ‘proxy variable’. This is a common assertion, but I find it really infuriating.

We macroeconomists are thrilled with the Nobel prize for Sargent and Sims.  But on causality:  they spent more time showing how hard it was to identify causality than showing how to do it.  And that’s a fair assessment of our field [economics]: causality is almost always in doubt.
  
More  here .
 
If I were in a snarky mood, I’d say something like, Causality is always in doubt in economics . . . unless you’re talking about abortion and crime, in which case you can be absolutely certain.
 
But I’m in a good mood right now so I won’t say that.  Instead I’ll just remark that, as a statistician, I’m positively thrilled that somebody named “Sims” received a major award.</p><p>4 0.11437073 <a title="1666-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-28-Economists_argue_about_Bayes.html">1695 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-28-Economists argue about Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent.

<p>Introduction: Interesting  discussion  by Berk Ozler (which I found following  links  from Tyler Cowen) of a study by Erwin Bulte, Lei Pan, Joseph Hella, Gonne Beekman, and Salvatore di Falco that compares two agricultural experiments, one blinded and one unblinded.  Bulte et al. find much different results in the two experiments and attribute the difference to expectation effects (when people know they’re receiving an experiment they behave differently); Ozler is skeptical and attributes the different outcomes to various practical differences in implementation of the two experiments.
 
I’m reminded somehow of the  notorious  sham experiment on the dead chickens, a story that was good for endless discussion in my Bayesian statistics class last semester.  I think we can all agree that dead chickens won’t exhibit a placebo effect.  Live farmers, though, that’s another story.
 
I don’t have any stake in this particular fight, but on quick reading I’m sympathetic to Ozler’s argument that this all is wel</p><p>3 0.80420429 <a title="1666-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-02-An_IV_won%E2%80%99t_save_your_life_if_the_line_is_tangled.html">550 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-02-An IV won’t save your life if the line is tangled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  See section 4 of  this article .
 
More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  a recent article , “Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems,” by fisheries researchers George Sugihara, Robert May, Hao Ye, Chih-hao Hsieh, Ethan Deyle, Michael Fogarty, and Stephan Munch.
 
I don’t know anything about ecology research but I could imagine this method being useful in that field.  I can’t see the approach doing much in political science, where I think their stated goal of “identifying causal networks” is typically irrelevant.
 
That said, if you replace the word “causality” by “predictability” everywhere in the paper, it starts to make a lot more sense.  As they write, they are working within “a framework that uses predictability as opposed to correlation to identify causation between time-series variables.”  Setting causation aside, predictability is an important topic in itself.  The search for patterns of predictability in complex structures may motivate causal hypotheses that can be studied more directly, using more traditional statis</p><p>5 0.76932639 <a title="1666-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-07-Descriptive_statistics%2C_causal_inference%2C_and_story_time.html">789 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-07-Descriptive statistics, causal inference, and story time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Backus points me to  this review  by anthropologist Mike McGovern of two books by economist Paul Collier on the politics of economic development in Africa.  My first reaction was that this was interesting but non-statistical so I’d have to either post it on the sister blog or wait until the 30 days of statistics was over.  But then I looked more carefully and realized that this discussion is very relevant to applied statistics. 
 
Here’s McGovern’s substantive critique:
  
Much of the fundamental intellectual work in Collier’s analyses is, in fact, ethnographic. Because it is not done very self-consciously and takes place within a larger econometric rhetoric in which such forms of knowledge are dismissed as “subjective” or worse still biased by the political (read “leftist”) agendas of the academics who create them, it is often ethnography of a low quality. . . .

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.


VIII. If you want to share a copy of this image, please ask first. If you want a real copy, you can ask about that too.

<p>Introduction: Washington Post and Slate reporter Anne Applebaum wrote a  dismissive  column about Wikileaks, saying that they “offer nothing more than raw data.”
 
Applebaum argues that “The notion that the Internet can replace traditional news-gathering has just been revealed to be a myth. . . . without more journalism, more investigation, more work, these documents just don’t matter that much.”
 
Fine.  But don’t undervalue the role of mere data!  The usual story is that we  don’t  get to see the raw data underlying newspaper stories.  Wikileaks and other crowdsourced data can be extremely useful, whether or not they replace “traditional news-gathering.”</p><p>3 0.93794179 <a title="1666-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-Who_gets_wedding_announcements_in_the_Times%3F.html">370 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-Who gets wedding announcements in the Times?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>5 0.93546027 <a title="1666-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-31-Watercolor_regression.html">1478 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-31-Watercolor regression</a></p>

Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.


2. You and your readers didn’t like that the edges of the filled CI were so sharp and arbitrary.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Mack writes:
  
There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>3 0.13105801 <a title="2135-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-29-%E2%80%9CQuestioning_The_Lancet%2C_PLOS%2C_And_Other_Surveys_On_Iraqi_Deaths%2C_An_Interview_With_Univ._of_London_Professor_Michael_Spagat%E2%80%9D.html">2191 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-29-“Questioning The Lancet, PLOS, And Other Surveys On Iraqi Deaths, An Interview With Univ. of London Professor Michael Spagat”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat points to  this interview , which, he writes, covers themes that are discussed on the blog such as wrong ideas that don’t die, peer review and the statistics of conflict deaths.
 
I agree.  It’s good stuff.  Here are some of the things that Spagat says (he’s being interviewed by Joel Wing):
  
In fact, the standard excess-deaths concept leads to an interesting conundrum when combined with an interesting fact exposed in the next-to-latest  Human Security Report ; in most countries child mortality rates decline during armed conflict (chapter 6). So if you believe the usual excess-death causality story then you’re forced to conclude that many conflicts actually save the lives of many children. Of course, the idea of wars savings lives is pretty hard to swallow. A much more sensible understanding is that there are a variety of factors that determine child deaths and that in many cases the factors that save the lives of children are stronger than the negative effects that confli</p><p>4 0.12616977 <a title="2135-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-11-The_Reliability_of_Cluster_Surveys_of_Conflict_Mortality%3A_Violent_Deaths_and_Non-Violent_Deaths.html">849 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-11-The Reliability of Cluster Surveys of Conflict Mortality: Violent Deaths and Non-Violent Deaths</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat sends in an interesting explanation for the noted problems with conflict mortality studies (a topic we’ve discussed on occasion on this blog).  Spagat writes:
  
 This analysis  is based on the fact that conflict violence does not spread out at all uniformly across a map but, rather, tends to concentrate in a few areas.  This means that small, headline-grabbing violence surveys are extremely unreliable.


There is a second point, based on the work of David Hemenway which you’ve also cited on your blog.  Even within exceptionally violent environments most households will still not have a violent death.   So a very small false positive rate in a household survey will cause substantial upward bias in violence estimates.</p><p>5 0.11914553 <a title="2135-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-27-Sampling_rate_of_human-scaled_time_series.html">112 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-27-Sampling rate of human-scaled time series</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes with two interesting questions involving time series analysis:
  
 
I used to work in an organization that designed and made signal processing equipment.  Antialiasing and windowing of time series was a big deal in performing analysis accurately.  


Now I’m in a place where I have to make inferences about human-scaled time series.  It has dawned on me that the two are related.  I’m not sure we often have data sampled at a rate at least twice the highest frequency present (not just the highest frequency of interest).  The only articles I’ve seen about aliasing as applied to social science series are from  Hinich  or from  related works .  Box and Jenkins hint at it in section 13.3 of Time Series Analysis, but the analysis seems to be mostly heuristic.  Yet I can imagine all sorts of time series subject to similar problems, from analyses of stock prices based on closing prices (mentioned in the latter article) to other economic series measured on a monthly basis to en</p><p>6 0.11021645 <a title="2135-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-19-Analysis_of_survey_data%3A_Design_based_models_vs._hierarchical_modeling%3F.html">352 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-19-Analysis of survey data: Design based models vs. hierarchical modeling?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This graph shows the estimate that Kenny Shirley and I have of support for the death penalty by sex and race in the U.S. since 1955:
 
   
 
We also found that capital punishment used to be more popular in the Northeast than in the South, but now it’s the other way around.
 
Here’s the abstract to  our paper :
  
One of the longest running questions that has been regularly included in Gallup’s national public opinion poll is “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Because the death penalty is governed by state laws rather than federal laws, it is of special interest to know how public opinion varies by state, and how it has changed over time within each state. In this paper we combine dozens of national polls taken over a fifty-year span and fit a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to individual response data to estimate changes in state-level public opinion over time. Such a long span of polls has not been analyzed this way before, partly</p><p>3 0.72916496 <a title="2135-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-07-Diabetes_stops_at_the_state_line%3F.html">454 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-07-Diabetes stops at the state line?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  Discover :
 
 
 
 Razib Khan  asks:
  
But follow the gradient from El Paso to the Illinois-Missouri border. The differences are small across state lines, but the consistent differences along the borders really don’t make. Are there state-level policies or regulations causing this? Or, are there state-level differences in measurement? This weird pattern shows up in other CDC data I’ve seen.

  
Turns out that CDC isn’t providing  data , they’re providing  model . Frank Howland answered: 
  

I suspect the answer has to do with the manner in which the county estimates are produced. I went to the original data source, the CDC, and then to the  relevant FAQ .


There they say that the diabetes prevalence estimates come from the “CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program.

On election days many of us see a colorful map of the U.S. where each tiny county has a color on the continuum between red and blue. So far we have not used such data to improve the effectiveness of marketing models. In this study, we show that we should.


We demonstrate the usefulness of political data via an interesting application–the demand for movies. Using boxoffice data from 25 counties in the U.S. Midwest (21 quarters between 2000 and 2005) we show that by including political data one can improve out-of-sample predictions significantly. Specifically, we estimate the improvement in forecasts due to the addition of political data to be around $43 million per year for the entire U.S. theatrical market.


Furthermore, when it comes to movies we depart from previous work in another way. While previous studies have relied on pre-determined movie genres, we estimate perceived movie attributes in a latent space and formulate viewers’ tastes as</p><p>5 0.69645625 <a title="2135-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Mr._P_by_another_name_._._._is_still_great%21.html">769 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Mr. P by another name . . . is still great!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  from Don Taylor:
  
Can national data be used to estimate state-level results? . . . A challenge is the fact that the sample size in many states is very small . . . Richard [Gonzales] used a regression approach to extrapolate this information to provide a state-level support for health reform:

 
To get around the challenge presented by small sample sizes, the model presented here combines the benefits of incorporating auxiliary demographic information about the states with the hierarchical modeling approach commonly used in small area estimation. The model is designed to “shrink” estimates toward the average level of support in the region when there are few observations available, while simultaneously adjusting for the demographics and political ideology in the state.

<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat sent me an email with the above heading, referring to  this paper  by Leontine Alkema and Jin Rou New, which begins:
  
National estimates of the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) are used to track progress in reducing child mortality and to evaluate countries’ performance related to United Nations Millennium Development Goal 4, which calls for a reduction in the U5MR by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. However, for the great majority of developing countries without well-functioning vital registration systems, estimating levels and trends in child mortality is challenging, not only because of limited data availability but also because of issues with data quality. Global U5MR estimates are often constructed without accounting for potential biases in data series, which may lead to inaccurate point estimates and/or credible intervals.


We describe a Bayesian penalized B-spline regression model for assessing levels and trends in the U5MR for all countries in the world, whereby bi</p><p>2 0.9560535 <a title="2135-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-09-%E2%80%9CMuch_of_the_recent_reported_drop_in_interstate_migration_is_a_statistical_artifact%E2%80%9D.html">404 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-09-“Much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact”</a></p>

I noticed that you have blogged a little about interstate migration trends in the US, and thought  that you might be interested in  a new working paper  of mine (joint with Sam Schulhofer-Wohl from the Minneapolis Fed) which I have attached.


Briefly, we show that much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact: The Census Bureau made an undocumented change in its imputation procedures for missing data in 2006, and this change significantly reduced the number of imputed interstate moves. The change in imputation procedures — not any actual change in migration behavior — explains 90 percent of the reported decrease in interstate migration between the 2005 and 2006 Current Population Surveys, and 42 percent of the decrease between 2000 and 2010.

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>4 0.94601506 <a title="2135-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Help_with_this_problem%2C_win_valuable_prizes.html">1164 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Help with this problem, win valuable prizes</a></p>

In the comments to  an earlier post , I mentioned a problem I am struggling with right now. Several people mentioned having (and solving!) similar problems in the past, so this seems like a great way for me and a bunch of other blog readers to learn something. I will describe the problem, one or more of you will tell me how to solve it, and you will win…wait for it….my thanks, and the approval and admiration of your fellow blog readers, and a big thank-you in any publication that includes results from fitting the model.  You can’t ask fairer than that!
 
Here’s the problem.  The goal is to estimate six parameters that characterize the leakiness (or air-tightness) of a house with an attached garage.  We are specifically interested in the parameters that describe the connection between the house and the garage; this is of interest because of the effect on the air quality in the house  if there are toxic chemic</p><p>5 0.94404244 <a title="2135-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-09-The_future_of_R.html">266 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-09-The future of R</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some thoughts from Christian , including this bit:
  
We need to consider separately


1. R’s brilliant library


2. R’s not-so-brilliant language and/or interpreter.
  
I don’t know that R’s library is so brilliant as all that–if necessary, I don’t think it would be hard to reprogram the important packages in a new language.
 
I would say, though, that the problems with R are not just in the technical details of the language.  I think the culture of R has some problems too.  As I’ve written before, R functions used to be lean and mean, and now they’re full of exception-handling and calls to other packages.  R functions are spaghetti-like messes of connections in which I keep expecting to run into syntax like “GOTO 120.”
 
I learned about these problems a couple years ago when writing bayesglm(), which is a simple adaptation of glm().  But glm(), and its workhorse, glm.fit(), are a mess:  They’re about 10 lines of functioning code, plus about 20 lines of necessary front-end, plus a cou</p><p>6 0.93936485 <a title="2135-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-18-uuuuuuuuuuuuugly.html">1862 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-18-uuuuuuuuuuuuugly</a></p>

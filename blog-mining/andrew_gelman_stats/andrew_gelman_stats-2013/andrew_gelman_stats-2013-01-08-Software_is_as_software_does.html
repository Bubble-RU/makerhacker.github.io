<p>Introduction: We had a recent  discussion  about statistics packages where people talked about the structure and capabilities of different computer languages.  One thing I wanted to add to this discussion is some sociology.  To me, a statistics package is not just its code, it’s also its community, it’s what people do with it.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>3 0.18844959 <a title="1661-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.

<p>Introduction: People keep telling me that Sas isn’t as bad as everybody says, but then I see (from  Christian Robert ) this listing from the Sas website of “disadvantages in using Bayesian analysis”:
  
There is no correct way to choose a prior. Bayesian inferences require skills to translate prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior. If you do not proceed with caution, you can generate misleading results. . . . From a practical point of view, it might sometimes be difficult to convince subject matter experts who do not agree with the validity of the chosen prior.
  
That is so tacky! As if least squares, logistic regressions, Cox models, and all those other likelihoods mentioned in the Sas documentation are so automatically convincing to subject matter experts.
 
P.S.  For some more serious objections to Bayesian statistics, see  here  and  here .
 
P.P.S.  In case you’re wondering why I’m commenting on month-old blog entries . . .

I’ve been following your blog a long time and enjoy your posts on visualization/statistical graphics matters.  I don’t recall however you ever describing the details of your setup for plotting.  I’m a new R user (convert from matplotlib) and would love to know your thoughts on the ideal setup: do you use mainly the R base?  Do you use lattice?  What do you think of ggplot2?  etc.  


I found ggplot2 nearly indecipherable until a recent eureka moment, and I think its default theme is a waste tremendous ink (all those silly grey backgrounds and grids are really unnecessary), but if you customize that away it can be made to look like ordinary, pretty statistical graphs.

<p>Introduction: Curt Yeske pointed me to  this .  Wow–these graphs are really hard to read!
 
The old me would’ve said that each of these graphs would be better replaced by a dotplot (or, better still, a series of lineplots showing time trends).
 
The new me would still like the dotplots and lineplots, but I’d say it’s fine to have the eye-grabbing but hard-to-read graphs as is, and then to have the more informative statistical graphics underneath, as it were.  The idea is, you’d click on the pretty but hard-to-read “infovis” graphs, and this would then reveal informative “full Cleveland” graphs.  And then if you click again you’d get a spreadsheet with the raw numbers.

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.

<p>Introduction: Tomas Iesmantas had  asked me  for advice on a regression problem with 50 parameters, and I’d recommended Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
 
A few weeks later he reported back: 
  
  
After trying several modifications (HMC for all parameters at once, HMC just for first level parameters and Riemman manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method), I finally got it running with HMC just for first level parameters and for others using direct sampling, since conditional distributions turned out to have closed form.


However, even in this case it is quite tricky, since I had to employ mass matrix and not just diagonal but at the beginning of algorithm generated it randomly (ensuring it is positive definite). Such random generation of mass matrix is quite blind step, but it proved to be quite helpful.


Riemman manifold HMC is quite vagarious, or to be more specific, metric of manifold is very sensitive. In my model log-likelihood I had exponents and values of metrics matrix elements was very large and wh</p><p>2 0.95290649 <a title="1661-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-09-Default_priors_update%3F.html">846 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-09-Default priors update?</a></p>

I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.

<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had a couple of email conversations in the past couple days on dependence in multivariate prior distributions.
 
 Modeling the degrees of freedom and scale parameters in the t distribution 
 
First, in our Stan group we’ve been discussing the choice of priors for the degrees-of-freedom parameter in the t distribution.  I wrote that also there’s the question of parameterization.  It does not necessarily make sense to have independent priors on the df and scale parameters.  In some sense, the meaning of the scale parameter changes with the df.
 
 Prior dependence between correlation and scale parameters in the scaled inverse-Wishart model 
 
The second case of parameterization in prior distribution arose from an email I received from Chris Chatham pointing me to  this exploration  by Matt Simpson of the scaled inverse-Wishart prior distribution for hierarchical covariance matrices.  Simpson writes:

<p>Introduction: We had a recent  discussion  about statistics packages where people talked about the structure and capabilities of different computer languages.  One thing I wanted to add to this discussion is some sociology.  To me, a statistics package is not just its code, it’s also its community, it’s what people do with it.
 
R, for example, is nothing special for graphics (again, I think in retrospect my graphs would be better if I’d been making them in Fortran all these years); what makes R graphics work so well is that there’s a clear path from the numbers to the graphs, there’s a tradition in R of postprocessing.
 
In comparison, consider Sas.  I’ve never directly used Sas but whenever I’ve seen it used, whether by people working for me or with me or just people down the hall who left Sas output sitting in the printer, in all these cases there’s no postprocessing.  It doesn’t look interactive at all.  The user runs some procedure and then there are pages and pages and pages of output.

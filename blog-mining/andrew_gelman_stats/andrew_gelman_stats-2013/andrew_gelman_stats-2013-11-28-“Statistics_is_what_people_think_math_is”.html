<p>Introduction: I was asked by Sophie Roell, an editor at  The Browser ,  where every day they ask an expert in a field to recommend the top five books, not by them, in their subject.  I was asked to recommend five books on how Americans vote.
 
The trouble is that I’m really pretty unfamiliar with the academic literature of political science, but it seemed sort of inappropriate for a political scientist such as myself to recommend non-scholarly books that I like (for example, “Style vs. Substance” by George V. Higgins, “Lies My Teacher Told Me,” by James Loewen, “The Rascal King” by Jack Beatty, “Republican Party Reptile” by P. J. O’Rourke, and, of course, “All the King’s Men,” by Robert Penn Warren).  I mean, what’s the point of that?  Nobody needs me to recommend books like that.
 
Instead, I moved sideways and asked if I could discuss five books on statistics instead.  Roell said that would be fine, so I sent her a quick description, which appears below.
 
The actual interview turned out much bett</p><p>3 0.18392868 <a title="2116-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-05-A_statistician_rereads_Bill_James.html">697 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-05-A statistician rereads Bill James</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.  Then I sent him some reflections on the great Bill James and  he published it !  If anybody out there knows Bill James, please send this on to him:  I have some questions at the end that I’m curious about.
 
Here’s how it begins:
  
 
I read my first Bill James book in 1984, took my first statistics class in 1985, and began graduate study in statistics the next year. Besides giving me the opportunity to study with the best applied statistician of the late 20th century (Don Rubin) and the best theoretical statistician of the early 21st (Xiao-Li Meng), going to graduate school at Harvard in 1986 gave me the opportunity to sit in a basement room one evening that</p><p>4 0.16983125 <a title="2116-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-09-Chartjunk%2C_but_in_a_good_cause%21.html">509 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-09-Chartjunk, but in a good cause!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  Dan Goldstein :
 
 
 
Pretty good, but really the pie chart should be three-dimensional, shown at an angle, and with one or two of the slices popping out.
 
P.S.  They seemed to have placed a link for the Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.  That bookâ&euro;&trade;s ok, but what I was really recommending were his Abstracts from 1982-1986, which are something else entirely.</p><p>5 0.16110295 <a title="2116-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-What_goes_around_._._..html">548 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-What goes around . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.

<p>Introduction: I was recently rereading and enjoying Bill James’s Historical Baseball Abstract (the second edition, from 2001).
 
But even the Master is not perfect.  Here he is, in the context of the all-time 20th-greatest shortstop (in his reckoning):
  
Are athletes special people?  In general, no, but occasionally, yes.  Johnny Pesky at 75 was trim, youthful, optimistic, and practically exploding with energy.  You rarely meet anybody like that who  isn’t  an ex-athlete–and that makes athletes seem special. [italics in the original]
  
Hey, I’ve met 75-year-olds like that–and none of them are ex-athletes!  That’s probably because I don’t know a lot of ex-athletes.  But Bill James . . . he knows a lot of athletes.  He went to the bathroom with Tim Raines once!  The most I can say is that I saw Rickey Henderson steal a couple bases when he was playing against the Orioles once.

<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone writes:
  
Probably not blog-worthy/blog-appropriate, but have you heard Bill James  discussing  the Sandusky & Paterno stuff?  I think you discussed once his stance on the Dowd Report, and this seems to be from the same part of his personality—which goes beyond contrarian . . .
  
I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.
 
In this sense even more of the blame should go</p><p>6 0.65783018 <a title="2116-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-05-A_statistician_rereads_Bill_James.html">697 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-05-A statistician rereads Bill James</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points me to a  thoughtful discussion  by Moti Nissani on “Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox.”
 
The paradox, as Nissani defines it, is that Mendel’s data seem in many cases too good to be true, yet Mendel had a reputation for probity and it seems doubtful that he had a Mark-Hauser-style attitude toward reporting scientific data.  Nissani writes:
  
Taken together, the situation seems paradoxical. On the one hand, we have evidence that “the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel’s expectations.” We also have good reasons to believe that Mendel encountered linkage but failed to report it and that he may have taken the somewhat unusual step of having his scientific records destroyed shortly after his death. On the other hand, everything else we know about him/in addition to his undisputed genius/suggests a man of unimpeachable integrity, fine observational powers, and a pa</p><p>6 0.34186029 <a title="2116-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-Math_Talks_%3A%3A_Action_Movies.html">1617 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-Math Talks :: Action Movies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Part 1.  The ideal policy 
 
Basbøll, as always,  gets  right to the point:
  
Andrew Gelman is not the plagiarism police because there is no such thing as the plagiarism police.
  
But, he continues:
  
There is, at any self-respecting university and any self-respecting academic journal, a plagiarism policy, and there sure as hell is a “morality” of writing in the world of scholarship. The cardinal rule is: don’t use other people’s words or ideas without attributing those words or ideas to the people you got them from.
  
What to do when the plagiarism (or, perhaps, sloppy quotation, to use a less loaded word) comes to light?
  
Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make one you have to correct it. Don’t explain why your mistake isn’t very serious or “set things right” by pointing to the “obvious” signs of your good intentions. . . . Don’t say you’ve cleared it with the original author. The real victim of your crime is not the other writer; it’s your reader.

<p>Introduction: Last month a history professor sent me a note regarding plagiarism at Arizona State University:
  
Matthew Whitaker, who had received an expedited promotion to full professor and was made Director of a new Center for the Study of Race and Democracy by Provost Elizabeth Capaldi and President Michael Crow, was charged by most of the full professors in the History Faculty with having plagiarized throughout his corpus of work, copying from regular works of scholarship and from web sources. Indeed, in his response, which claimed that the petitioners were racist, Whitaker admitted to plagiarism in his work, defending himself in part by stating that he had not reviewed carefully the research and writing he had hired others to do. . . .
  
What bothered my correspondent was that Whitaker remains an ASU Foundation Professor of History despite all the plaig. According to Whitaker’s  webpage , he “is also a highly sought after speaker, having offered commentaries on NPR, PBS, . . . and other medi</p><p>4 0.25341764 <a title="1867-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-15-Things_we_do_on_sabbatical_instead_of_actually_working.html">345 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-15-Things we do on sabbatical instead of actually working</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the time of our last  discussion , Edward Wegman, a statistics professor who has also worked for government research agencies, had been involved in three cases of plagiarism:  a report for the U.S. Congress on climate models, a paper on social networks, a paper on color graphics.
 
Each of the plagiarism stories was slightly different:  the congressional report involved the distorted copying of research by a scientist (Raymond Bradley) whose conclusions Wegman disagreed with, the social networks paper included copied material in its background section, and the color graphics paper included various bits and pieces by others that had been used in old lecture notes.
 
Since then, blogger Deep Climate has  uncovered  another plagiarized article by Wegman, this time an article in a 2005 volume on data mining and data visualization.  Deep Climate writes, “certain sections of Statistical Data Mining rely heavily on lightly edited portions on lectures from Wegman’s statistical data mining c</p><p>6 0.23689397 <a title="1867-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-A_%28not_quite%29_grand_unified_theory_of_plagiarism%2C_as_applied_to_the_Wegman_case.html">728 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-A (not quite) grand unified theory of plagiarism, as applied to the Wegman case</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>3 0.81672043 <a title="1867-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-08-Poli_sci_plagiarism_update%2C_and_a_note_about_the_benefits_of_not_caring.html">400 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-08-Poli sci plagiarism update, and a note about the benefits of not caring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:
  
The essence of plagiarism is passing off someone else’s work as</p><p>4 0.81042051 <a title="1867-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-A_%28not_quite%29_grand_unified_theory_of_plagiarism%2C_as_applied_to_the_Wegman_case.html">728 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-A (not quite) grand unified theory of plagiarism, as applied to the Wegman case</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

Each of the plagiarism stories was slightly different:  the congressional report involved the distorted copying of research by a scientist (Raymond Bradley) whose conclusions Wegman disagreed with, the social networks paper included copied material in its background section, and the color graphics paper included various bits and pieces by others that had been used in old lecture notes.
 
Since then, blogger Deep Climate has  uncovered  another plagiarized article by Wegman, this time an article in a 2005 volume on data mining and data visualization.  Deep Climate writes, “certain sections of Statistical Data Mining rely heavily on lightly edited portions on lectures from Wegman’s statistical data mining c</p><p>6 0.78709531 <a title="1867-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Last_Wegman_post_%28for_now%29.html">766 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Last Wegman post (for now)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My econ dept colleague Joseph Stiglitz  suggests  that financial fraudsters be sent to prison.  He points out that the usual penalty–million-dollar fines–just isn’t enough for crimes whose rewards can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
That all makes sense, but why do the options have to be:
 
1.  No punishment
 
2.  A fine with little punishment or deterrent value
 
3.  Prison. 
 
What’s the point of putting nonviolent criminals in prison?  As I’ve said  before , I’d prefer if the government just took all these convicted thieves’ assets along with 95% of their salary for several years, made them do community service (sorting bottles and cans at the local dump, perhaps; a financier should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc. If restriction of personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, they could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if you are ever more than 3 miles from your home.  And a curfew so you have to stay home bet</p><p>2 0.9550333 <a title="1867-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-12-OpenData_Latinoamerica.html">1853 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-12-OpenData Latinoamerica</a></p>

We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain. Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight International Journalism Fellows.

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this forthcoming article  in the journal Nutrition by J. F. Lee et al.  
 
It looks pretty cool.  I’m glad that someone went to the effort of performing this careful study.  Regular readers will know that I’ve been  waiting  for this one for awhile.
 
In case you can’t read the article through the paywall, here’s the abstract:
  
 Background:   Under a widely-accepted theory of caloric balance, any individual has a set-point weight and will find it uncomfortable and typically unsustainable to keep his or her weight below that point.  Set-points have evidently been increasing over the past few decades in the United States and other countries, leading to a public-health crisis of obesity.  In an n=1 study, Roberts (2004, 2006) proposed an intervention to lower the set-point via daily consumption of unflavored sugar water or vegetable oil.


 Objective:   To evaluate weight-loss outcomes under the diet proposed by Roberts (2004, 2006).

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

It’s time for an update:
 
 
 
It’s still gonna take awhile for the Catholics to catch up. . . .
 
And this one might be relevant too:
 
 
 
It looks as if Jews and men have been overrepresented, also  Episcopalians  (which, as I noted earlier, are not necessarily considered Protestant in terms of religious doctrine but which I counted as such for the ethnic categorization).  Religion is an interesting political variable because it’s nominally about religious belief but typically seems to be more about ethnicity.</p><p>6 0.91760725 <a title="1867-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-10-The_U.S._as_welfare_state.html">196 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-10-The U.S. as welfare state</a></p>

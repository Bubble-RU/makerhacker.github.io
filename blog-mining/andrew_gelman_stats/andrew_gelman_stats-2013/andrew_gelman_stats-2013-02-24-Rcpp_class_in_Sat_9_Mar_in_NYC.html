A colleague sends in some suugestions based on a recent experience with a package update:
  
 1. Always use the R dev version to write a package.  Not the current stable release.  The R people use the R dev version to check your package anyway.  If you don’t use the R dev version, there is chance that your package won’t pass the check.  In my own experience, every time R has a major change, it tends to have new standards and find new errors in your package with these new standards.  So better use the dev version to find out the potential errors in advance.


 2. After submission, write an email to claim it.   I used to submit the package to the CRAN without writing an email.  This was standard operating procedure, but it has changed. Writing an email to claim about the submission is now a requir</p><p>3 0.14386663 <a title="1736-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-10-Some_interesting_unpublished_ideas_on_survey_weighting.html">705 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-10-Some interesting unpublished ideas on survey weighting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago we had an amazing all-star session at the Joint Statistical Meetings.  The topic was new approaches to survey weighting (which is  a mess , as I’m sure you’ve heard).
 
Xiao-Li Meng  recommended shrinking weights by taking them to a fractional power (such as square root) instead of trimming the extremes. 
 
Rod Little  combined design-based and model-based survey inference. 
 
Michael Elliott  used mixture models for complex survey design. 
 
And here’s  my introduction  to the session.</p><p>4 0.13288286 <a title="1736-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-Contest_for_developing_an_R_package_recommendation_system.html">324 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-Contest for developing an R package recommendation system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I spoke tonight at the NYC R meetup, John Myles White and Drew Conway told me about  this competition  they’re administering for developing a recommendation system for R packages.  They seem to have already done some work laying out the network of R packages–which packages refer to which others, and so forth.
 
I just hope they set up their system so that my own packages (“R2WinBUGS”, “r2jags”, “arm”, and “mi”) get recommended automatically.  I really hate to think that there are people out there running regressions in R and not using display() and coefplot() to look at the output.
 
P.S.  Ajay Shah asks what I mean by that last sentence.  My quick answer is that it’s good to be able to visualize the coefficients and the uncertainty about them. The default options of print(), summary(), and plot() in R don’t do that:
 
- print() doesn’t give enough information 
- summary() gives everything to a zillion decimal places and gives useless things like p-values 
- plot() gives a bunch</p><p>5 0.12308019 <a title="1736-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-05-The_statistics_software_signal.html">1655 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-05-The statistics software signal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>6 0.10313597 <a title="1736-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-17-Weak_identification_provides_partial_information.html">1903 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-17-Weak identification provides partial information</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hadley  writes:
  
I [Hadley] am going to be teaching an R development master class in New York City on Dec 
12-13. The basic idea of the class is to help you write better code, 
focused on the mantra of “do not repeat yourself”. In day one you will 
learn powerful new tools of abstraction, allowing you to solve a wider 
range of problems with fewer lines of code. Day two will teach you how 
to make packages, the fundamental unit of code distribution in R, 
allowing others to save time by allowing them to use your code.


To get the most out of this course, you should have some experience 
programming in R already: you should be familiar with writing 
functions, and the basic data structures of R: vectors, matrices, 
arrays, lists and data frames. You will find the course particularly 
useful if you’re an experienced R user looking to take the next step, 
or if you’re moving to R from other programming languages and you want 
to quickly get up to speed with R’s unique features.

<p>Introduction: We need help picking out an automatic differentiation package for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior of a  generalized linear model with deep interactions.  Specifically, we need to compute gradients for log probability functions with thousands of parameters that involve matrix (determinants, eigenvalues, inverses), stats (distributions), and math (log gamma) functions.  Any suggestions?
    
 The Application: Hybrid Monte Carlo for Posteriors 
 
We’re getting serious about implementing posterior sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC speeds up mixing by including gradient information to help guide the Metropolis proposals toward areas  high probability.  In practice, the algorithm requires a handful or  of gradient calculations per sample, but there are many dimensions and the functions are hairy enough we don’t want to compute derivaties by hand.

<p>Introduction: The Stan meeting today reminded me of Joel Spolsky’s recasting of the Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the Painter. Joel retold it on his blog,  Joel on Software , in the post  Back to Basics :
  

Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.


The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”


“I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”

<p>Introduction: Devah Pager points me to  this article  by Uri Simonsohn, which begins:
  
Three articles published [by Brett Pelham et al.] have shown that a disproportionate share of people choose spouses, places to live, and occupations with names similar to their own. These findings, interpreted as evidence of implicit egotism, are included in most modern social psychology textbooks and many university courses. The current article successfully replicates the original findings but shows that they are most likely caused by a combination of cohort, geographic, and ethnic confounds as well as reverse causality.
  
From Simonsohn’s article, here’s a handy summary of the claims and the evidence (click on it to enlarge):
 
   
 
The Pelham et al. articles have come up several times on the blog, starting with  this discussion  and  this estimate  and then more recently  here .  I’m curious what Pelham and his collaborators think of Simonsohn’s claims.</p><p>3 0.75815213 <a title="1736-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-16-Recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">1765 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-16-Recently in the sister blog</a></p>

 http://PredictWiseQ.com  is our (beta) prediction contest which aims to estimate not just the marginal probabilities of election outcomes this November, but millions of correlations among outcomes as well, like the chance Obama will win both Ohio and Florida, or the chance Romney will win if the September jobs numbers are negative. It’s a working example of a combinatorial prediction market design we published this summer in the conference ACM EC’12.

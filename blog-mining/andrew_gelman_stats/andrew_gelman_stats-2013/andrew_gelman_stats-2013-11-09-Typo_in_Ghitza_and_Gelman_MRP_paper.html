<p>Introduction: Jeff asked me what I thought of  this  recent AJPS article by Brian Greenhill, Michael Ward, and Audrey Sacks, “The Separation Plot: A New Visual Method for Evaluating the Fit of Binary Models.”  It’s similar to a graph of observed vs. predicted values, but using color rather than the y-axis to display the observed values.  It seems like it could be useful, also could be applied more generally to discrete-data regressions with more than two categories.
 
When it comes to checking the model fit, I recommend binned residual plots, as discussed in  this 2000 article  with Yuri Goegebeur, Francis Tuerlinckx, and Iven Van Mechelen.</p><p>3 0.11519486 <a title="2095-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-24-5_seconds_of_every_%231_pop_single.html">587 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-24-5 seconds of every #1 pop single</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jas sends along  this paper  (with Devin Caughey), entitled Regression-Discontinuity Designs and Popular Elections: Implications of Pro-Incumbent Bias in Close U.S. House Races, and writes:
  
The paper shows that regression discontinuity does not work for US House elections. Close House elections are anything but random. It isn’t election recounts or something like that (we collect recount data to show that it isn’t).  We have collected much new data to try to hunt down what is going on (e.g., campaign finance data, CQ pre-election forecasts, correct many errors in the Lee dataset). The substantive implications are interesting.  We also have a section that compares in details Gelman and King versus the Lee estimand and estimator.
  
I had a few comments:
  

 
David Lee is not estimating the effect of incumbency; he’s estimating the effect of the incumbent party, which is a completely different thing.  The regression discontinuity design is completely inappropriate for estimating the</p><p>6 0.094030872 <a title="2095-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-22-Spell-checking_example_demonstrates_key_aspects_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">2182 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-22-Spell-checking example demonstrates key aspects of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone points me to  this  news article by Christopher Shea on the challenges of debunking ESP.  Shea  writes :
  
Earlier this year, a major psychology journal published a paper suggesting that there was some evidence for “pre-cognition,” a form of ESP. Stuart Ritchie, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh, is part of a team that tried, but failed, to replicate those results. Here, he tells the Chronicle of Higher Education’s Tom Bartlett about the difficulties he’s had getting the results published.


Several journals told the team they wouldn’t publish a study that did no more than disprove a previous study. . . . An editor at another journal said he’d “only accept our paper if we ran a fourth experiment where we got a believer [in ESP] to run all the participants, to control for . . . experimenter effects.”
  
My reaction is, this isn’t as easy a question as it might seem.  At first, one’s reaction might share Ritchie’s frustration that a shoddy paper by Bem got p</p><p>3 0.7461248 <a title="2095-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t_think_of_it_as_duplication._Think_of_it_as_a_single_paper_in_a_superposition_of_two_quantum_journals.%E2%80%9D.html">1654 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-“Don’t think of it as duplication.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>4 0.70776916 <a title="2095-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-29-Stupid_legal_crap.html">58 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-29-Stupid legal crap</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve whined before in this space that some of my most important, innovative, and influential papers are really hard to get published.  I’ll go through endless hassle with a journal or sometimes several journals until I find some place willing to publish.  It’s just irritating.
 
I was thinking about this recently because a colleague and I just finished a paper that I love love love.  But I can’t figure out where to submit it.  This is a paper for which I would prefer the so-called reverse-journal-submission approach.  Instead of sending the paper to journal after journal after journal, waiting years until an acceptance (recall that, unless you’re Bruno Frey, you’re not allowed to submit the same paper to multiple journals simultaneously), you post the paper on a public site, and then journals compete to see who gets to publish it.  I think that system would work well with a paper like this which is offbeat but has a nontrivial chance of becoming highly influential.

<p>Introduction: Devin Caughey points out a typo in the second column of page 765 of  our AJPS paper .  Here’s what we have:
 
 
 
The typo is in the third line of the second paragraph above.  Where it says y^*_j = y.bar^*_j n_j, it should be y^*_j = y.bar^*_j n^*_j.
 
 One frustrating system of the current system of journal publication is that I know of no way to append this correction to the published article.  I can put it here, but anyone who misses this is stuck.  And I don’t think the AJPS can link from the article to this post.  I contacted the editor of the AJPS who said there will be no problem appending the correction to the electronic version of the article.</p><p>2 0.70382822 <a title="2095-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-06-Fake_newspaper_headlines.html">188 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-06-Fake newspaper headlines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I used  this convenient site  to create some images for a talk I’m preparing.  (The competing headlines:  “Beautiful parents have more daughters” vs. “No compelling evidence that beautiful parents are more or less likely to have daughters.”  The latter gets cut off at “No compelling evidence that,” which actually works pretty well to demonstrate the sort of dull headline that would result if newspapers were to publish null results.)</p><p>3 0.69790196 <a title="2095-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Something on Applied Bayesian Statistics
 
April 27, 4:10-5 p.m., 1011 Evans Hall
 
I will deliver  one  of the following three talks: 
1.  Of beauty, sex, and power: Statistical challenges in estimating small effects  
2.  Why we (usually) don’t worry about multiple comparisons  
3.  Parameterization and Bayesian modeling  
Whoever shows up on time to the seminar gets to vote, and I’ll give the talk that gets the most votes.</p><p>4 0.69619024 <a title="2095-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-23-Life_in_the_C-suite%3A__A_graph_that_is_both_ugly_and_bad%2C_and_an_unrelated_story.html">1734 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-23-Life in the C-suite:  A graph that is both ugly and bad, and an unrelated story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jemes Keirstead sends along  this infographic :
 
 
 
He hates it:
  
First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.e. the pinch point in the glass) is actually 3-5 years in the future and the past sand includes “up to three years” in the future.  Then there are the percentages which are appear to represent a vertical distance, not volume of sand or width of the hourglass.  Add to that a strange color scheme in which green goes from dark to light to dark again.


I know January’s not even finished yet, but surely a competitor for worst infographic of 2013?
  
Keirstead doesn’t even comment on what I see as the worst aspect of the graph, which is that the “3-5 years” band is the narrowest on the graph, but expressed as a per-year rate it is actually the  highest  of all the percentages.  The hourglass visualization does the astounding feat of taking the period where the executives expect the highest rate of change and presenting it as a minimum in the graph.</p><p>5 0.69240403 <a title="2095-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-24-ESPN_is_looking_to_hire_a_research_analyst.html">1279 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-24-ESPN is looking to hire a research analyst</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

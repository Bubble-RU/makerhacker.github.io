<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>3 0.17007847 <a title="1859-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-04-Honored_oldsters_write_about_statistics.html">2317 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-04-Honored oldsters write about statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The new book titled: Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science is now  available for download .
 
The official description makes the book sound pretty stuffy:
  
Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science, commissioned by the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) to celebrate its 50th anniversary and the International Year of Statistics, will be published in April by Taylor & Francis/CRC Press. Through the contributions of a distinguished group of 50 statisticians, the book showcases the breadth and vibrancy of statistics, describes current challenges and new opportunities, highlights the exciting future of statistical science, and provides guidance for future statisticians. Contributors are past COPSS award honorees.
  
But it actually has lots of good stuff, including the chapter by Tibshirani which I  discussed  last year (in the context of the “bet on sparsity principle”), and chapters by XL and other fun people.  Also my own chapter,  How do we choo</p><p>4 0.15645272 <a title="1859-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-06-Choose_your_default%2C_or_your_default_will_choose_you_%28election_forecasting_edition%29.html">1564 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-06-Choose your default, or your default will choose you (election forecasting edition)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Statistics is the science of defaults.
 
One of the differences between statistics and other branches of engineering is that we have a special love for default procedures, perhaps because so many statistical problems are routine (or, at least, people would like them to be).  We have standard estimates for all sorts of models, books of statistical tests, and default settings for everything.  Recently I’ve been working on default weakly informative priors (which are  not  the same as the typically noninformative “reference priors” of the Bayesian literature).  From a Bayesian point of view, the appropriate default procedure could be defined as that which is appropriate for the population of problems that one might be studying.
 
More generally, much of our job as statisticians is to come up with methods that will be used by others in routine practice.  (Much of the rest of our job is to come up with methods for evaluating new and existing statistical methods, and methods for coming up wi</p><p>5 0.15316403 <a title="1859-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-15-Quote_of_the_day%3A__statisticians_and_defaults.html">147 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-15-Quote of the day:  statisticians and defaults</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Keith O’Rourke and I wrote  an article  that begins:
  
Textbooks on statistics emphasize care and precision, via concepts such as reliability and validity in measurement, random sampling and treatment assignment in data collection, and causal identification and bias in estimation. But how do researchers decide what to believe and what to trust when choosing which statistical methods to use? How do they decide the credibility of methods? Statisticians and statistical practitioners seem to rely on a sense of anecdotal evidence based on personal experience and on the attitudes of trusted colleagues. Authorship, reputation, and past experience are thus central to decisions about statistical procedures.
  
It’s for a volume on theoretical or methodological research on authorship, functional roles, reputation, and credibility in social media, edited by Sorin Matei and Elisa Bertino.</p><p>4 0.7911948 <a title="1859-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-27-Should_statistics_have_a_Nobel_prize%3F.html">2151 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-27-Should statistics have a Nobel prize?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>5 0.78895324 <a title="1859-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-05-Call_for_book_proposals.html">557 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-05-Call for book proposals</a></p>

Large and complex datasets are becoming prevalent in the social and behavioral sciences and statistical methods are crucial for the analysis and interpretation of such data. The Chapman & Hall/CRC Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series aims to capture new developments in statistical methodology with particular relevance to applications in the social and behavioral sciences. It seeks to promote appropriate use of statistical, econometric and psychometric methods in these applied sciences by publishing a broad range of monographs, textbooks and handbooks.


The scope of the series is wide, including applications of statistical methodology in sociology, psychology, economics, education, marketing research, political science, criminology, public policy, demography, survey methodology and official statistics.

<p>Introduction: I was asked to write an article for the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) 50th anniversary volume.   Here it is  (it’s labeled as “Chapter 1,” which isn’t right; that’s just what came out when I used the template that was supplied).  The article begins as follows:
  
The field of statistics continues to be divided into competing schools of thought. In theory one might imagine choosing the uniquely best method for each problem as it arises, but in practice we choose for ourselves (and recom- mend to others) default principles, models, and methods to be used in a wide variety of settings. This article briefly considers the informal criteria we use to decide what methods to use and what principles to apply in statistics problems.
  
And then I follow up with these sections:
  
Statistics: the science of defaults

<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .

<p>Introduction: This one belongs in the statistical lexicon.  Kaiser Fung  nails it :
  
In reading [news] articles, we must look out for the moment(s) when the reporters announce story time. Much of the article is great propaganda for the statistics lobby, describing an attempt to use observational data to address a practical question, sort of a Freakonomics-style application.


We have no problems when they say things like: “There is a substantial gap at year’s end between students whose teachers were in the top 10% in effectiveness and the bottom 10%. The fortunate students ranked 17 percentile points higher in English and 25 points higher in math.”


Or this: “On average, Smith’s students slide under his instruction, losing 14 percentile points in math during the school year relative to their peers districtwide, The Times found. Overall, he ranked among the least effective of the district’s elementary school teachers.”

<p>Introduction: Appointed “inflation czar” in late 1970s, Alfred Kahn is  most famous  for deregulating the airline industry.  At the time this seemed to make sense, although in retrospect I’m less a fan of consumer-driven policies than I used to be.  When I was a kid we subscribed to Consumer Reports and so I just assumed that everything that was good for the consumer–lower prices, better products, etc.–was a good thing.  Upon reflection, though, I think it’s a mistake to focus too narrowly on the interests of consumers.  For example (from  my Taleb review  a couple years ago):
  
The discussion on page 112 of how Ralph Nader saved lives (mostly via seat belts in cars) reminds me of his car-bumper campaign in the 1970s. My dad subscribed to Consumer Reports then (he still does, actually, and I think reads it for pleasure–it must be one of those Depression-mentality things), and at one point they were pushing heavily for the 5-mph bumpers. Apparently there was some federal regulation about how strong</p><p>5 0.95564461 <a title="1859-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-20-The_candy_weighing_demonstration%2C_or%2C_the_unwisdom_of_crowds.html">2257 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-20-The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From 2008:
  
 The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds 


My favorite statistics demonstration is the one with the bag of candies. I’ve elaborated upon it since including it in  the Teaching Statistics book  and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.


 Preparation 


Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it’s exactly 100.


You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.


Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.


 Setup

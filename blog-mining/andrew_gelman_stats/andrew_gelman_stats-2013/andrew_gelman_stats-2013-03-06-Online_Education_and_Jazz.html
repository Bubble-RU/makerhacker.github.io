Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.

</p><p>5 The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences. [sent-9, score-1.492]
</p><p>6 We’re not all the way there yet:  We have the technology to record a live class for repeated consumption but it’s still not so easy to do, certainly not as easy as pushing a button on a tape recorder to get a rough if imperfect capture of a music performance. [sent-11, score-1.183]
</p><p>7 It would’ve been cool if my class this fall had been video recorded, but it never happened. [sent-12, score-0.407]
</p><p>8 One difference between music and lectures is that, for most people, the only substitute for live music is broadcast or recorded music. [sent-13, score-1.709]
</p><p>9 It may well be that in the near future the good lectures will be recorded and students will be required to watch them before they come to class. [sent-15, score-0.793]
</p><p>10 One reason I never post my slides before class is that I’m worried that students would then read the slides as a substitute for reading the book. [sent-18, score-1.019]
</p><p>11 So now I fear the future where students will watch the video instead of reading. [sent-20, score-0.468]
</p><p>12 ”  I think that’s right, but remember that students can read the textbook over and over again too, in fact physical (paper-based) textbooks are random access and I find much easier to go find things in, compared to video. [sent-23, score-0.49]
</p><p>13 Attending a concert or listening to broadcast or recorded music. [sent-27, score-0.515]
</p><p>14 Yes, some people listen to music carefully and repeatedly, but that’s still different from taking a class, I think. [sent-30, score-0.519]
</p><p>15 To put it another way, if you’re a music student listening to music, that’s like a university student taking a class. [sent-31, score-0.68]
</p><p>16 But lots and lots of people listen to music just to hear it, not to study it, while not so many people watch college classes just for fun. [sent-32, score-0.645]
</p><p>17 I agree with everything that Alex wrote, and I also agree that it would be good to move toward a future where instructors do very little lecturing and instead spend class time helping students working on problems in small groups. [sent-34, score-0.963]
</p><p>18 When discussing teaching strategy with our young instructors here, I always advise them to go with the book rather than spending long hours preparing supplementary reading material (which, I assure them, the students will never read). [sent-36, score-0.677]
</p><p>19 I also tell them not to prepare lectures, not to lecture at all but just to go with the textbook and spend class time working out problems (this is particularly appropriate and easy to do in an introductory class). [sent-37, score-0.734]
</p><p>20 They usually don’t follow my advice, but I think that’s not because they think their lectures are so great but rather because things are set up now so that it’s much less effort to stand up and lecture than to arrange problem-solving and discussion sections. [sent-38, score-0.613]

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: In response to some big new push for testing schoolchildren, Mark Palko  writes :
  
The announcement of a new curriculum is invariably followed by a round of hearty round of self congratulations and talk of “keeping standards high” as if adding a slide to a PowerPoint automatically made students better informed. It doesn’t work that way. Adding a topic to the list simply means that students will be exposed to it, not that they will understand or master or retain it.
  
Well put.  In my own teaching, I often am tempted to believe that just putting a topic in a homework problem is enough to ensure that students will learn it.  But it doesn’t work that way.  Even if they manage to somehow struggle through and solve the problem (and many don’t, or they rely on their friends’ solutions), they won’t learn much if they don’t see the connection with everything else they know.

<p>Introduction: Anthony Goldbloom writes:
  
For those who haven’t come across Kaggle, we are a new platform for data prediction competitions. Companies and researchers put up a dataset and a problem and data scientists compete to produce the best solutions. 


We’ve just launched a new initiative called Kaggle in Class, allowing instructors to host competitions for their students. Competitions are a neat way to engage students, giving them the opportunity to put into practice what they learn. The platform offers live leaderboards, so students get instant feedback on the accuracy of their work. And since competitions are judged on objective criteria (predictions are compared with outcomes), the platform offers unique assessment 
opportunities.


The first Kaggle in Class competition is being hosted by Stanford University’s Stats 202 class and requires students to predict the price of different wines based on vintage, country, ratings and other information.

There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

I work at National Prescribing Services in Australia.  I have a database representing say, antidiabetic drug utilisation for the entire Australia in the past few years. I planned to do a longitudinal analysis across GP Division Network (112 divisions in AUS) using mixed-effects models (or as you called in your book varying intercept and varying slope) on this data. 


The problem here is: as data actually represent the population who use antidiabetic drugs in AUS, should I use 112 fixed dummy variables to capture the random variations or use varying intercept and varying slope for the model ? Because some one may aruge, like divisions in AUS or states in USA can hardly be considered from a “superpopulation”, then fixed dummies should be used.  What I think is the population are those who use the drugs, what will happen when the rest need to use them? In terms of exchangeability, using varying intercept and varying slopes can be justified.

<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: I received a bunch of interesting comments on my  blog  on adjusting SAT scores.  Below I have a long comment from a colleague with experience in the field.
 
But first, this hilarious (from a statistical perspective) story from Howard Wainer:
  
Some years ago when we were visiting Harvard [as a parent of a potential student, not in Howard's role as educational researcher], an admissions director said two things of relevance (i) the SAT hasn’t got enough ‘top’ for Harvard — it doesn’t discriminate well enough at the high end. To prove this she said (ii) that Harvard had more than 1500 ‘perfect 1600s’ apply. Some were rejected. I mentioned that there were only about 750 1600s from HS seniors in the US — about 400 had 1600 in their junior year (and obviously didn’t retake) and about 350 from their senior year. So, I concluded, she must be mistaken.


Then I found out that they allowed applicants to pick and choose their highest SAT-V score and their highest SAT-M score from separate adm</p><p>5 0.95723218 <a title="1752-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-16-Detecting_cheating_in_chess.html">1676 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-16-Detecting cheating in chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Three different people have pointed me to  this post  by Ken Regan on statistical evaluation of claims of cheating in chess.  So I figured I have to satisfy demand and post something on this.  But I have nothing to say.  All these topics interest me, but I somehow had difficulty reading through the entire post.  I scanned through but what I really wanted to see was some data.  Show me a scatterplot, then I’ll get interested.
 
P.S.  This is meant as no disparagement of Regan or his blog.  I just couldn’t quite get into this particular example.</p><p>6 0.95650995 <a title="1752-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-06-Priors_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">2322 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-06-Priors I don’t believe</a></p>

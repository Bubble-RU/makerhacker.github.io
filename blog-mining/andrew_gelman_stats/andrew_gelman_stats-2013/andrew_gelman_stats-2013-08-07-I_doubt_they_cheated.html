This paper’s findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China’s Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectanci</p><p>3 0.14666402 <a title="1971-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-14-Everyone%E2%80%99s_trading_bias_for_variance_at_some_point%2C_it%E2%80%99s_just_done_at_different_places_in_the_analyses.html">1763 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-14-Everyone’s trading bias for variance at some point, it’s just done at different places in the analyses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some things I respect 
 
When it comes to meta-models of statistics, here are two philosophies that I respect:
 
1.  (My) Bayesian approach, which I associate with E. T. Jaynes, in which you construct models with strong assumptions, ride your models hard, check their fit to data, and then scrap them and improve them as necessary.
 
2.  At the other extreme, model-free statistical procedures that are designed to work well under very weak assumptions—for example, instead of assuming a distribution is Gaussian, you would just want the procedure to work well under some conditions on the smoothness of the second derivative of the log density function.
 
Both the above philosophies recognize that (almost) all important assumptions will be wrong, and they resolve this concern via aggressive model checking or via robustness.  And of course there are intermediate positions, such as working with Bayesian models that have been shown to be robust, and then still checking them.  Or, to flip it arou</p><p>4 0.14076965 <a title="1971-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-09-I_hate_polynomials.html">2365 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-09-I hate polynomials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent discussion with Mark Palko [scroll down to the comments at  this link ] reminds me that I think that polynomials are way way overrated, and I think a lot of damage has arisen from the old-time approach of introducing polynomial functions as a canonical example of linear regressions ( for example ). There are very few settings I can think of where it makes sense to fit a general polynomial of degree higher than 2. I think that millions of students have been brainwashed into thinking of these as the canonical functions and that this has caused endless trouble later on. I’m not sure how I’d change the high school math curriculum to deal with this, but I do think it’s an issue.</p><p>5 0.1404262 <a title="1971-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-28-Economists_argue_about_Bayes.html">1695 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-28-Economists argue about Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  posted  a review of a submitted manuscript where I first wrote that I read the paper only shallowly and then followed up with some suggestions on the statistical analysis, recommending that overdispersion be added to a fitted Posson regression and that the table of regression results be supplemented with a graph showing data and fitted lines.
 
A commenter asked why I wrote such an apparently shallow review, and I realized that some of the implications of my review were not as clear as I’d thought.  So let me clarify.
 
There is a connection between my general reaction and my statistical comments.  My statistical advice here is relevant for (at least) two reasons.  First, a Poisson regression without overdispersion will give nearly-uninterpretable standard errors, which means that I have no sense if the results are statistically significant as claimed.  Second, with a time series plot and regression table, but no graph showing the estimated treatment effect, it is very dif</p><p>3 0.85187644 <a title="1971-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-23-Scientists_can_read_your_mind_._._._as_long_as_the%E2%80%99re_allowed_to_look_at_more_than_one_place_in_your_brain_and_then_make_a_prediction_after_seeing_what_you_actually_did.html">106 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-23-Scientists can read your mind . . . as long as the’re allowed to look at more than one place in your brain and then make a prediction after seeing what you actually did</a></p>

Brain scans may be able to predict what you will do better than you can yourself . . .  They found a way to interpret “real time” brain images to show whether people who viewed messages about using sunscreen would actually use sunscreen during the following week.


The scans were more accurate than the volunteers were, Emily Falk and colleagues at the University of California Los Angeles reported in the Journal of Neuroscience. . . .


About half the volunteers had correctly predicted whether they would use sunscreen. The research team analyzed and re-analyzed the MRI scans to see if they could find any brain activity that would do better.


Activity in one area of the brain, a particular part of the medial prefrontal cortex, provided the best information.


“From this region of the brain, we can predict for about three-quarters of the people whether they will increase their use of sunscreen beyond what they say they will do,” Lieberman said.

This paper’s findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China’s Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectanci</p><p>5 0.80999929 <a title="1971-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-11-The_happiness_gene%3A__My_bottom_line_%28for_now%29.html">706 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-11-The happiness gene:  My bottom line (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a couple of email exchanges with Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and James Fowler, two of the authors of the article on the gene that is associated with life satisfaction which we  blogged  the other day.  (Bruno Frey, the third author of the article in question, is out of town according to his email.)  Fowler also commented  directly  on the blog.
 
I won’t go through all the details, but now I have a better sense of what’s going on.  (Thanks, Jan and James!)  Here’s my current understanding:
 
 1.   The original manuscript was divided into two parts:   an article  by De Neve alone published in the Journal of Human Genetics, and  an article  by De Neve, Fowler, Frey, and Nicholas Christakis submitted to Econometrica.  The latter paper repeats the analysis from the Adolescent Health survey and also replicates with data from the Framingham heart study (hence Christakis’s involvement).
 
The Framingham study measures a slightly different gene and uses a slightly life-satisfaction question com</p><p>6 0.80609035 <a title="1971-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-16-%E2%80%9CFalse-positive_psychology%E2%80%9D.html">1171 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-16-“False-positive psychology”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”

I saw your  recent blog post  where you discussed in passing an iterative-chain-of models approach to AI. 


I essentially built such a thing for  my PhD thesis  – not in a Bayesian context, but in a logic programming context – and proved it had a few properties and showed how you could solve some toy problems. The important bit of my framework was that at various points you also go and get more data in the process – in a statistical context this might be seen as building a little univariate model on a subset of the data, then iteratively extending into a better model with more data and more independent variables – a generalized forward stepwise regression if you like.  It wrapped a proper computational framework around E.M. Gold’s identification/learning in the limit based on a logic my advisor (Eric Martin) had invented.

<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

<p>Introduction: The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society publishes papers followed by discussions.  Lots of discussions, each can be no more than 400 words.  Here’s my most recent discussion:
  
The authors are working on an important applied problem and I have no reason to doubt that their approach is a step forward beyond diagnostic criteria based on point estimation.  An attempt at an accurate assessment of variation is important not just for statistical reasons but also because scientists have the duty to convey their uncertainty to the larger world.  I am thinking, for example, of discredited claims such as that of the mathematician who claimed to predict divorces with 93% accuracy (Abraham, 2010).


Regarding the paper at hand, I thought I would try an experiment in comment-writing.  My usual practice is to read the graphs and then go back and clarify any questions through the text.  So, very quickly:  I would prefer Figure 1 to be displayed in terms of standard deviations, not variances.

<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

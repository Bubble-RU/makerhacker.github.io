I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly.

<p>Introduction: I’ll reorder this week’s  posts  a bit in order to continue on a topic that came up yesterday.
 
A couple days ago a reporter wrote to me asking what I thought of  this paper  on Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle.  I responded:
  
Given the quality of the  earlier paper  by these researchers, I’m not inclined to believe anything these people write.  But, to be specific, I can point out some things:


- The authors define low fertility as days 8-14.  Oddly enough, these authors in their earlier paper used days 7-14.  But according to womenshealth.gov, the most fertile days are between days 10 and 17.  The choice of these days affects their analysis, and it is not a good sign that they use different days in different papers.  (see more on this point in sections 2.3 and 3.1 of this paper:  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)


- They perform a lot of different analyses, and many others could be performed.  For example, “Study 1 indicates that ovul</p><p>3 0.24709664 <a title="1860-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?  It depends on the size of the treatment interactions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class.

<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.21356823 <a title="1860-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-06-How_much_time_%28if_any%29_should_we_spend_criticizing_research_that%E2%80%99s_fraudulent%2C_crappy%2C_or_just_plain_pointless%3F.html">2235 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-06-How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a brief email exchange with Jeff Leek regarding our recent  discussions  of replication, criticism, and the self-correcting process of science.
 
Jeff writes:
  
(1) I can see the problem with serious, evidence-based criticisms not being published in the same journal (and linked to) studies that are shown to be incorrect. I have been mostly seeing these sorts of things show up in blogs. But I’m not sure that is a bad thing. I think people read blogs more than they read the literature. I wonder if this means that blogs will eventually be a sort of “shadow literature”? 


(2) I think there is a ton of bad literature out there, just like there is a ton of bad stuff on Google. If we focus too much on the bad stuff we will be paralyzed. I still manage to find good papers despite all the bad papers. 


(3) I think one positive solution to this problem is to incentivize/publish referee reports and give people credit for a good referee report just like they get credit for a good paper.

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.

Unless I missed it, you haven’t commented on the recent  article  of Michael Bang Peterson [with Daniel Sznycer, Aaron Sell, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby].

This review begins with “If you are physically strong, social science scholars believe they can predict whether or not you are more conservative than other men…Men’s upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, they write, and they believe that the link may reflect psychological traits that evolved in response to our early ancestral environments and continue to influence behavior today. . . . they surveyed hundreds of people in America, Denmark and Argentina about bicep size, socioeconomic status, and support for economic redistribution.”

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>6 0.85179073 <a title="1860-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-26-Suggested_resolution_of_the_Bem_paradox.html">1139 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-26-Suggested resolution of the Bem paradox</a></p>

Hubbard testified on behalf of Countrywide in the MBIA suit. He conducted an “analysis” that essentially concluded that Countrywide’s loans weren’t any worse than the loans produced by other mortgage originators, and that therefore the monstrous losses that investors in those loans suffered were due to other factors related to the economic crisis – and not caused by the serial misrepresentations and fraud in Countrywide’s underwriting.

I [Kahan] saw it at  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-100-year-march-of-technology-in-1-graph/255573/  , which misidentified the source (not “visual economics”;   visualizingeconomics   .com ,  which attributes it  to  Nicholas Felton , who apparently condensed  this version , which I worry could cause a stroke).

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Kaul wrotes:
  
By statute (“the least burdensome” pathway), the approval standard for devices by the US FDA is lower than for drugs. Before a new drug can be marketed, the sponsor must show “substantial evidence of effectiveness” as based on two or more well-controlled clinical studies (which literally means 2 trials, each with a p value of <0.05, or 1 large trial with a robust p value <0.00125). In contrast, the sponsor of a new device, especially those that are designated as high-risk (Class III) device, need only demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to an FDA-approved device via the 510(k) exemption or a "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness", evaluated through a pre-market approval and typically based on a single study.


What does “reasonable assurance” or “substantial equivalence” imply to you as a Bayesian? These are obviously qualitative constructs, but if one were to quantify them, how would you go about addressing it?

<p>Introduction: I received two emails yesterday on related topics.
 
First, Stephen Olivier pointed me to  this post  by Daniel Lakens, who wrote the following open call to statisticians:
  
You would think that if you are passionate about statistics, then you want to help people to calculate them correctly in any way you can. . . . you’d think some statisticians would be interested in helping a poor mathematically challenged psychologist out by offering some practical advice.
  
I’m the right person to ask this question, since I actually have written a lot of material that helps psychologists (and others) with their data analysis. But there clearly are communication difficulties, in that my work and that of other statisticians hasn’t reached Lakens. Sometimes the contributions of statisticians are made indirectly. For example, I wrote Bayesian Data Analysis, and then Kruschke wrote Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Our statistics book made it possible for Kruschke to write his excellent book for psycholo</p><p>5 0.9642452 <a title="1860-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-27-Macromuddle.html">1347 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-27-Macromuddle</a></p>
<p>Introduction: More and more I feel like economics reporting is based on crude principles of adding up “good news” and “bad news.”  Sometimes this makes sense:  by almost any measure, an unemployment rate of 10% is bad news compared to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Other times, though, the good/bad news framework seems so tangled.
 
For example:  house prices up is considered good news but inflation is considered bad news.  A strong dollar is considered good news but it’s also an unfavorable exchange rate, which is bad news.  When facebook shares go down, that’s bad news, but if they automatically go up, that means they were underpriced which doesn’t seem so good either.  Pundits are torn between rooting for the euro to fail (which means our team (the U.S.) is better than Europe (their team)) and rooting for it to survive (because a collapse in Europe is bad news for the U.S. economy).  China’s economy doing well is bad news—but if their economy slips, that’s bad news too.

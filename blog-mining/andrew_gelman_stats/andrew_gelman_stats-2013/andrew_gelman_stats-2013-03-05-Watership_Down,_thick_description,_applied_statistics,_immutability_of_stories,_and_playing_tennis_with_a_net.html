 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work?

<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>4 0.14174987 <a title="1750-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Theoretical_vs_applied_statistics.html">498 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Theoretical vs applied statistics</a></p>

I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Xiao-Li  says  yes:
  
The most compelling reason for having highly visible awards in any field is to enhance its ability to attract future talent. Virtually all the media and public attention our profession received in recent years has been on the utility of statistics in all walks of life. We are extremely happy for and proud of this recognition—it is long overdue. However, the media and public have given much more attention to the Fields Medal than to the COPSS Award, even though the former has hardly been about direct or even indirect impact on everyday life. Why this difference? . . . these awards arouse media and public interest by featuring how ingenious the awardees are and how difficult the problems they solved, much like how conquering Everest bestows admiration not because the admirers care or even know much about Everest itself but because it represents the ultimate physical feat. In this sense, the biggest winner of the Fields Medal is mathematics itself: enticing the brig</p><p>3 0.81827098 <a title="1750-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-23-%E2%80%9CAny_old_map_will_do%E2%80%9D_meets_%E2%80%9CGod_is_in_every_leaf_of_every_tree%E2%80%9D.html">1278 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-23-“Any old map will do” meets “God is in every leaf of every tree”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a statistician I am particularly worried about the rhetorical power of anecdotes (even though I use them in my own reasoning; see discussion below).  But much can be learned from a  true  anecdote.  The rough edges—the places where the anecdote doesn’t fit your thesis—these are where you learn.
 
We have recently had a discussion ( here  and  here ) of Karl Weick, a prominent scholar of business management who plagiarized a story and then went on to draw different lessons from the pilfered anecdote in several different publications published over many years.
 
Setting aside an issues of plagiarism and rulebreaking, I argue that, by hiding the source of the story and changing its form, Weick and his management-science audience are losing their ability to get anything out of it beyond empty confirmation.
 
A full discussion follows.

<p>Introduction: David Blackwell was already retired by the time I came to Berkeley, and probably our closest connection was that I taught the class in decision theory that he used to teach.  I enjoyed that class a lot, partly because it took me out of my usual comfort zone of statistical inference and data analysis toward something more theoretical and mathematical.  Blackwell was one of the legendary figures in the department at that time and was also one of the most tolerant of alternative approaches to statistics, perhaps because of combination of a mathematical background, applied research in the war and after (which I learned about in  this recent obituary ), and personal experiences,
 
Blackwell may be best known in statistics for the  Rao-Blackwell theorem .  Rao, of course, is also famoust for the Cramer-Rao lower bound.  Both theorems relate to minimum-variance statistical estimators.

<p>Introduction: Dave Backus points me to  this review  by anthropologist Mike McGovern of two books by economist Paul Collier on the politics of economic development in Africa.  My first reaction was that this was interesting but non-statistical so I’d have to either post it on the sister blog or wait until the 30 days of statistics was over.  But then I looked more carefully and realized that this discussion is very relevant to applied statistics. 
 
Here’s McGovern’s substantive critique:
  
Much of the fundamental intellectual work in Collier’s analyses is, in fact, ethnographic. Because it is not done very self-consciously and takes place within a larger econometric rhetoric in which such forms of knowledge are dismissed as “subjective” or worse still biased by the political (read “leftist”) agendas of the academics who create them, it is often ethnography of a low quality. . . .


Despite the adoption of a Naipaulian unsentimental-dispatches-from-the-trenches rhetoric, the story told in Collier’s</p><p>6 0.79509693 <a title="1750-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-30-Works_well_versus_well_understood.html">738 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-30-Works well versus well understood</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  just posted  the discussions of his paper (with Leah Jager), “An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature,” along with some further comments of his own.
 
 Here  are my original thoughts on an earlier version of their article.  Keith O’Rourke and I expanded these thoughts into  a formal comment  for the journal.  We’re pretty much in agreement with John Ioannidis (you can find his discussion in the top link above).
 
In quick summary, I agree with Jager and Leek that this is an important topic.  I think there are two key places where Keith and I disagree with them:
 
1.  They take published p-values at face value whereas we consider them as the result of a complicated process of selection.  This is something I didn’t used to think much about, but now I’ve become increasingly convinced that the problems with published p-values is not a simple file-drawer effect or the case of a few p=0.051 values nudged toward p=0.049, bu</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9798888 <a title="1750-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-05-Watership_Down%2C_thick_description%2C_applied_statistics%2C_immutability_of_stories%2C_and_playing_tennis_with_a_net.html">1750 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-05-Watership Down, thick description, applied statistics, immutability of stories, and playing tennis with a net</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For the past several months I’ve been circling around and around some questions related to the issue of how we build trust in statistical methods and statistical results.  There are lots of examples but let me start with my own career.  My most cited publications are my books and my methods papers, but I think that much of my credibility as a statistical researcher comes from my applied work.  It somehow matters, I think, when judging my statistical work, that I’ve done (and continue to do) real research in social and environmental science.
 
Why is this?  It’s not just that my applied work gives me good examples for my textbooks.  It’s also that the applied work motivated the new methods.  Most of the successful theory and methods that my collaborators and I have developed, we developed in the context of trying to solve active applied problems.  We weren’t trying to shave a half a point off the predictive error in the Boston housing data; rather, we were attacking new problems that we</p><p>3 0.97968137 <a title="1750-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-28-The_holes_in_my_philosophy_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">781 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-28-The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10. Inference about μ is straightforward, as is model checking, whether based on graphs or numerical summaries such as the sample variance and skewn</p><p>4 0.97953147 <a title="1750-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding_the_p-value.html">1760 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-12-Misunderstanding the p-value</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The New York Times has a feature in its Tuesday science section, Take a Number, to which I occasionally contribute (see  here  and  here ).
 
Today’s  column , by Nicholas Balakar, is in error.  The column begins:
  
When medical researchers report their findings, they need to know whether their result is a real effect of what they are testing, or just a random occurrence. To figure this out, they most commonly use the p-value.
  
This is wrong on two counts.  First, whatever researchers might feel, this is something they’ll never know.  Second, results are a combination of real effects and chance, it’s not either/or.
 
Perhaps the above is a forgivable simplification, but I don’t think so; I think it’s a simplification that destroys the reason for writing the article in the first place.  But in any case I think there’s no excuse for this, later on:
  
By convention, a p-value higher than 0.05 usually indicates that the results of the study, however good or bad, were probably due only</p><p>5 0.97937995 <a title="1750-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-13-What_are_the_important_issues_in_ethics_and_statistics%3F__I%E2%80%99m_looking_for_your_input%21.html">1117 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-13-What are the important issues in ethics and statistics?

<p>Introduction: I’ve recently started a regular column on ethics, appearing every three months in  Chance magazine .  My first column, “Open Data and Open Methods,” is  here , and my second column, “Statisticians:  When we teach, we don’t practice what we preach” (coauthored with Eric Loken) will be appearing in the next issue.
 
Statistical ethics is a wide-open topic, and I’d be very interested in everyone’s thoughts, questions, and stories.  I’d like to get beyond generic questions such as, Is it right to do a randomized trial when you think the treatment is probably better than the control?, and I’d also like to avoid the really easy questions such as, Is it ethical to copy Wikipedia entries and then sell the resulting publication for  $2800  a year?  [Note to people who are sick of hearing about this particular story:  I'll consider stopping my blogging on it, the moment that the people involved consider apologizing for their behavior.]

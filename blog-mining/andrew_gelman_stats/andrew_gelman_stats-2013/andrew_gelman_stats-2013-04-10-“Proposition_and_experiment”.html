Here are some of the comments on the linked page:
 
 
 
Rather than redrawing the picture to make the lines more clear, I’d say:  leave the graphic as is, and have a link to a set of statistical graphs that show where the different sorts of old trees are and what they look like.  Let’s value the above image for its clean look and its clever Christmas-tree design, and once we have it, take advantage of viewers’ interest in the topic to show them more.

<p>Introduction: I happened to come across a little book, “Current Glossary:  Words Coined Since the War.”  Here are some of them:
 
as’pi-rin, n.  A white compound used as a drug in the cure of headaches and rheumatism.
 
bob’go, n.  A kind of antelope in Africa; its meat is good for food.
 
cat’ta-lo, n.  A cross between an American bison and a cow.
 
dart, n.  A short, pointed spear-like weapon of steel dropped by airmen in attacks on the enemy.
 
free’lance, n.  A rover in literature, a writer not in the employ of one firm.
 
griz’zly bear.  A new kind of dance.
 
You get the idea.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil, and I’m writing about the slow pace of change in 21st-century America.
 
[Note added later: at the time that I wrote this, I was unaware that a year-and-a-half ago Andrew had written  a similar post on the theme.  I suspect I, and perhaps most of this blog's readers, missed it because he posted it on New Year's Day].
 
[Note added later still: evidently I'm wrong and I did see Andrew's post, because I left a comment on it: " If you want to pick a 50-year period, with nice round numbers for the start and the end, my vote for the biggest lifestyle change for Americans is 1900-1950. Radio, telephone, television, indoor plumbing, refrigerators, home air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes… in the past 50 years all of those things have gotten better than they used to be (although I’m not sure there have been any major advances in indoor plumbing), but the change is small compared with having vs not having."   And I was wrong about indoor plumbing, which most people di</p><p>3 0.73229462 <a title="1797-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-12-Why_it_doesn%E2%80%99t_make_sense_to_chew_people_out_for_not_reading_the_help_page.html">955 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-12-Why it doesn’t make sense to chew people out for not reading the help page</a></p>

Barry Rowlingson gave an interesting talk at UseR 2011, “Why R-help must die!” He suggested the Q-and-A type sites Stack Overflow (on programming) and Cross Validated (on statistics), both part of Stack Exchange.
  
I haven’t used R-help recently but I do occasionally send people there.  Just to see what was going on there, I  clicked on over , did a little searching, and found  this delight  from a renowned professor of R.  There’s something about the “please” there that just makes it all that much more special.  (In contrast, the advice  here  to “please do your homework” just seems rude.
 
I have a larger (or maybe smaller) point to make, though, which is about the silliness of advice to “read the damn manual” etc.

<p>Introduction: Our research assistants have unearthed the following guest column by H. L. Mencken which appeared in the New York Times of 5 Nov 1933, the date at which Prohibition ended in the United States. As a public service we are reprinting it here.
 
I’m particularly impressed at how the Sage of Baltimore buttressed his article with references to the latest scientific literature of the time. I think you’ll all agree that Mencken’s column, in which he took a stand against the legality of alcohol consumption, has  contemporary relevance , more than 80 years later.
 
Because of the challenge of interpreting decades-old references, we have asked a leading scholar of Mencken’s writings to add notes where appropriate, to clarify any points of confusion. And now here’s Mencken’s column (with notes added in brackets), in its entirety:

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV. Only 3 of the 26 televisions we analyzed were discounte</p><p>6 0.70447284 <a title="1797-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-16-Using_economics_to_reduce_bike_theft.html">1536 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-16-Using economics to reduce bike theft</a></p>

<p>Introduction: [Update: Revised given comments from Wingfeet, Andrew and germo.  Thanks!  I'd mistakenly translated the dlnorm priors in the first version --- amazing what a difference the priors make.  I also escaped the less-than and greater-than signs in the constraints in the model so they're visible.  I also updated to match the thin=2 output of JAGS.]
 
We’re going to be starting a Stan “model of the P” (for some time period P) column, so I thought I’d kick things off with one of my own.  I’ve been following the  Wingvoet blog , the author of which is identified only by the Blogger handle  Wingfeet ;  a couple of days ago this lovely post came out:
  
  PK calculation of IV and oral dosing in JAGS 
   
Wingfeet’s post implemented an answer to question 6 from chapter 6 of problem from Rowland and Tozer’s 2010 book,   Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  , Fourth edition, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins.   
 
So in the grand tradition of using this blog to procrastinate, I thought I’d t</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87678361 <a title="1797-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-10-%E2%80%9CProposition_and_experiment%E2%80%9D.html">1797 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-10-“Proposition and experiment”</a></p>

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.

<p>Introduction: Washington Post and Slate reporter Anne Applebaum wrote a  dismissive  column about Wikileaks, saying that they “offer nothing more than raw data.”
 
Applebaum argues that “The notion that the Internet can replace traditional news-gathering has just been revealed to be a myth. . . . without more journalism, more investigation, more work, these documents just don’t matter that much.”
 
Fine.  But don’t undervalue the role of mere data!  The usual story is that we  don’t  get to see the raw data underlying newspaper stories.  Wikileaks and other crowdsourced data can be extremely useful, whether or not they replace “traditional news-gathering.”</p><p>4 0.8325206 <a title="1797-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-Stan_is_fast.html">1476 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-Stan is fast</a></p>

Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.


2. You and your readers didn’t like that the edges of the filled CI were so sharp and arbitrary.

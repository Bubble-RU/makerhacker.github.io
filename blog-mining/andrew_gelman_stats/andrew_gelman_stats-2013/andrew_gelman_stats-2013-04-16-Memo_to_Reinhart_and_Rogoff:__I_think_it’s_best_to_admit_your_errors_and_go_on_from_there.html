</p><p>4 On the methodology, they do not deny  any  of the data and methodological errors pointed out by Herndon et al. [sent-10, score-0.275]
</p><p>5 It’s a step forward that they’re not denying it, but to not admit it—that’s just tacky. [sent-14, score-0.182]
</p><p>6 And I speak as someone who’s made serious data errors myself, most notably in  this  retracted paper (background  here ). [sent-15, score-0.206]

</p><p>9 This wasn’t a problem in my map of all voters, because i adjusted the total to the actual vote, but for the map of just whites it was a problem because my model didn’t “know” that New Hampshire was nearly all white. [sent-36, score-0.222]
</p><p>10 So, yeah, I think Reinhart and Rogoff should admit they have a problem too. [sent-42, score-0.164]
</p><p>11 Here’s Reinhart and Rogoff defending themselves:    It is hard to see how one can interpret these [corrected] tables and individual country results as showing that public debt overhang over 90% is clearly benign. [sent-44, score-0.295]
</p><p>12 actually wrote was:    The full extent of those errors transforms the reality of modestly diminished average GDP growth rates for countries carrying high levels of public debt into a false image that high public debt ratios inevitably entail sharp declines in GDP growth. [sent-48, score-0.974]
</p><p>13 Moreover, as we show, there is a wide range of GDP growth performances at every level of public debt among the 20 advanced economies that RR survey. [sent-49, score-0.351]
</p><p>14 don’t say that high debt is “clearly benign,” they say that it’s not inevitably bad. [sent-51, score-0.212]
</p><p>15 Reinhart and Rogoff have a real quantitative point to make—the point is that “modestly diminished average GDP growth rates” can be a big deal. [sent-53, score-0.164]
</p><p>16 I haven’t looked at the data myself so I can’t offer any informed statistical commentary, but not a single person in the discussion seems to be denying that Reinhart and Rogoff messed up with their data, so I assume this actually happened. [sent-62, score-0.168]
</p><p>17 Which makes it even seem even more awkward that they didn’t directly admit it. [sent-63, score-0.12]
</p><p>18 I think they should also thank Herndon, Ash, and Pollin for finding multiple errors in their paper. [sent-70, score-0.197]
</p><p>19 And of course I have decades of experience making research errors of different degrees of seriousness. [sent-77, score-0.146]
</p><p>20 I hope that, tomorrow or sometime soon, Reinhart and Rogoff will admit their mistakes, profusely thank their critics, and move on. [sent-81, score-0.222]

Or too little?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Economist Stan Liebowitz has a  longstanding interest  in the difficulties of flagging published research errors.  Recently he wrote on the related topic of dishonest authorship:
  
While not about direct research fraud, I thought you might be interested in  this paper . It discusses the manner in which credit is given for economics articles, and I suspect it applies to many other areas as well. One of the conclusions is that the lack of complete proration per author will lead to excessive coauthorship, reducing overall research output by inducing the use of larger than efficient-sized teams. Under these circumstances, false authorship can be a response to the warped reward system and false authorship might improve research efficiency since it might keep actual research teams (as opposed to nominal teams) from being too large to produce research efficiently. One of the questions I rhetorically ask in the paper is whether anyone has ever been ‘punished’ for having their name included on</p><p>3 0.24375743 <a title="1805-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-02-7_ways_to_separate_errors_from_statistics.html">1835 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-02-7 ways to separate errors from statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers have been inspired by the recent Reinhardt and Rogoff  debacle  to  list  “six ways to separate lies from statistics” in economics research:
  
1. “Focus on how robust a finding is, meaning that different ways of looking at the evidence point to the same conclusion.”


2.  Don’t confuse statistical with practical significance.


3.  “Be wary of scholars using high-powered statistical techniques as a bludgeon to silence critics who are not specialists.”


4.  “Don’t fall into the trap of thinking about an empirical finding as ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ At best, data provide an imperfect guide.”


5.  “Don’t mistake correlation for causation.”


6.  “Always ask ‘so what?’”
  
I like all these points, especially #4, which I think doesn’t get said enough.  As I  wrote  a few months ago, high-profile social science research aims for proof, not for understanding—and that’s a problem.

<p>Introduction: We had a  discussion  the other day of a paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change,” by economist Richard Tol.
 
The paper came to my attention after I saw a  notice  from Adam Marcus that it was recently revised because of data errors.  But after looking at the paper more carefully, I see a bunch of other problems that, to me, make the whole analysis close to useless as it stands.
 
I think this is worth discussing because the paper has been somewhat influential (so far cited 328 times, according to Google Scholar) and has even been cited in the  popular press  as evidence that “Climate change has done more good than harm so far and is likely to continue doing so for most of this century . . . There are many likely effects of climate change: positive and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial. And if you aggregate them all, the overall effect is positive today — and likely to stay positive until around 2080. That was the conclusion of Professor Richard Tol</p><p>5 0.12148446 <a title="1805-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-30-%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_at_least_as_much_as_an_80_percent_chance_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">982 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-30-“There’s at least as much as an 80 percent chance . . .”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  points  to the above self-canceling statement which comes from a quantitatively-trained  expert  on international debt.  I can only assume that he was speaking quickly and that the reporter didn’t know enough to ask him to clarify.  When I’m interviewed, I emit a lot of ums, uhs, and probably quite a few meaningless remarks, but usually whoever is interviewing me knows to just keep the good stuff.  As Kaiser points out, the above quote could mean two completely opposite things!  In context I’m sure it was clear to the speaker but it’s not at all obvious what’s going on in the published version.  Again, I’m not blaming the expert here, it’s just a miscommunication that got into the article, something that Kaiser noticed (and that I care about) because of our interest in probability communication.

<p>Introduction: Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall, authors of  that paper  that claimed that women at peak fertility were more likely to wear red or pink shirts (see further discussion  here  and  here ), and then a later paper that claimed that this happens in some weather but not others, just informed me that they have posted a note in disagreement with an paper by Eric Loken and myself.
 
Our paper is unpublished, but I do have the megaphone of this blog, and Tracy and Beall do not, so I think it’s only fair to link to their note right away.  I’ll quote from their note (but if you’re interested,  please follow the link and read the whole thing ) and then give some background and my own reaction.

I’m passing you this  recent  news article by Ewen Callaway in the hope that you will make a comment about the methodology on your blog.  It’s generated some  back and forth  between the economics and science communities.


I [Peyton] am very sceptical of the reductive approach taken by the economics profession generally, and the normative implications this kind of research generates. For example, p. 7 of the  working paper  states: “…[according to our model] decreasing the diversity of the most diverse country in the sample (Ethopia) by 1 percentage point would raise its income per capita by 21 percent”. Understandably, this piece is couched in assumptions that would take hours to pick apart, but their discussion of the approach belies the uncertainty involved. The main response by the authors in defense is that genetic diversity is a ‘proxy variable’. This is a common assertion, but I find it really infuriating.

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas points me to  this excellently-titled working paper  by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen, and himself:
  
Is social media a valid indicator of political behavior? We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion. With over 500 million active users in 2012, Twitter now represents a new frontier for the study of human behavior. This research provides a framework for incorporating this emerging medium into the computational social science toolkit.

<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>6 0.79052311 <a title="1805-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-06-Against_optimism_about_social_science.html">1844 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-06-Against optimism about social science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As a matter of convention, we usually run 3 or 4 chains in JAGS. By default, this gives rise to chains that draw samples from 3 or 4 distinct pseudorandom number generators. I didn’t go and check whether it does things 111,222,333 or 123,123,123, but in any event the “parallel chains” in JAGS are samples drawn from distinct RNGs computed on a single processor core.
  But we all have multiple cores now, or we’re computing on a cluster or the cloud! So the behavior we’d like from  rjags  is to use the  foreach  package with each JAGS chain using a parallel-safe RNG. The default behavior with  n.chain=1  will be that each parallel instance will use  .RNG.name[1] , the Wichmann-Hill RNG. 
  JAGS 2.2.0 includes a new  lecuyer  module (along with the  glm  module, which everyone should probably always use, and doesn’t have many undocumented tricks that I know of).  But lecuyer is completely undocumented!

<p>Introduction: Jeff Ratto points me to  this  news article by Dean Baker reporting the work of three economists, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who  found  errors in a much-cited  article  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff analyzing historical statistics of economic growth and public debt.  Mike Konczal  provides  a clear summary; that’s where I got the above image.
 
 Errors in data processing and data analysis 
 
It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff flubbed it.  Herndon et al. write of “spreadsheet errors, omission of available data, weighting, and transcription.”  The spreadsheet errors are the most embarrassing, but the other choices in data analysis seem pretty bad too.  It can be tough to work with small datasets, so I have sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, but it does look like they were jumping to conclusions in their paper.  Perhaps the urgency of the topic moved them to publish as fast as possible rather than carefully considering the impact of their data-analytic choi</p><p>3 0.90471953 <a title="1805-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-27-No_matter_how_famous_you_are%2C_billions_of_people_have_never_heard_of_you..html">374 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-27-No matter how famous you are, billions of people have never heard of you.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Doug Hartmann  writes  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Justice Antonin Scalia’s comment in the Supreme Court hearings on the U.S. law defining marriage that “there’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.”
  
Hartman argues that Scalia is factually incorrect—there is not actually “considerable disagreement among sociologists” on this issue—and quotes a recent  report  from the American Sociological Association to this effect.  Assuming there’s no other considerable group of sociologists (Hartman knows of only one  small  group) arguing otherwise, it seems that Hartman has a point.  Scalia would’ve been better off omitting the phrase “among sociologists”—then he’d have been on safe ground, because you can always find  somebody  to take a position on the issue. Jerry Falwell’s no longer around but there’s a lot more where he came from.

<p>Introduction: The usually-reasonable-even-if-you-disagree-with-him Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
Presumably diplomats either enjoy serving their country or they enjoy the ego rents of being a diplomat or both.  It is a false feeling of power, borrowed power from one’s country of origin rather than from one’s personal achievements.
  
Huh?  I’d hardly think this needs to be explained, but here goes:
  

 
1.  Diplomats may feel the  duty  to serve their country, which is not the same as “enjoying” it.  Sometimes people take on jobs that are challenging and not well-paid because they feel that it is their duty to do their best at it.
 
2.  Some diplomats are very accomplished individuals, and that is why they are chosen to represent their country.  Consider an analogy:  Yes, Tyler Cowen borrows some power from George Mason University.  But it goes the other way too:  GMU borrows power from TC.
 
Beyond all this, and returning to more selfish goals, being a diplomat can be fun–you get to live in a foreign c</p><p>6 0.88058043 <a title="1805-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-Deviance_as_a_difference.html">729 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-Deviance as a difference</a></p>

</p><p>5 After detailing the limited and conflicting guidance on sample design in the multilevel model didactic literature, illustrative nationally-representative datasets and published examples that violate the posited requirements are identified. [sent-10, score-1.554]
</p><p>6 Because the didactic literature is either silent on sample design requirements or in disagreement with the constraints posited here, two Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to clarify the issues. [sent-11, score-0.759]
</p><p>7 The results indicate that bias follows use of samples that fail to satisfy the requirements outlined; notably, the bias is poorly-behaved, such that estimates provide neither upper nor lower bounds for the population parameter. [sent-12, score-1.008]
</p><p>8 Thus, published multilevel model analyses using many workhorse datasets, including NELS, AdHealth, NLSY, GSS, PSID, and SIPP, often unwittingly convey substantive results and theoretical conclusions that lack foundation. [sent-14, score-0.706]
</p><p>9 Future research using the multilevel model should be limited to cases that satisfy the sample requirements described. [sent-15, score-1.126]
</p><p>10 Just as we can fit single-level regressions to data that are not random samples, we can fit multilevel models to data that are not two-stage random samples. [sent-18, score-0.696]
</p><p>11 Ultimately we are interested in generalizing to a larger population, so if our data are  not  simple random samples, we need to account for this, a concern that I and others address using multilevel modeling and poststratification; see, for example, my recent  paper  with Yair. [sent-19, score-0.904]
</p><p>12 But this is not a problem unique to multilevel models. [sent-20, score-0.352]
</p><p>13 Hree’s what Lucas writes:    I contend, some datasets on which the MLM has been estimated are non-probability samples for the MLM. [sent-22, score-0.357]
</p><p>14 Further, this circumstance may not be rare; the processes transforming probability samples into problematic samples for the MLM may be inconspicuous but widespread. [sent-26, score-0.644]
</p><p>15 So, yes, I think Lucas is correct to be concerned about generalizing from sample to population (what Lucas calls “bias”); it’s a huge issue in psychology and medical studies performed on volunteers or unrepresentative samples. [sent-29, score-0.627]
</p><p>16 But I don’t wee anything specially problematic about multilevel models, especially if the researcher takes the next step and does poststratification (which is, essentially, regression adjustment) to correct for differences between sample and population. [sent-30, score-0.944]
</p><p>17 If the data are  crap , it’ll be hard to trust anything that comes out of your analysis, but multilevel modeling won’t be making things any worse. [sent-31, score-0.544]
</p><p>18 On the contrary:  multilevel analysis is a way to model bias and variation. [sent-32, score-0.582]
</p><p>19 So in that sense I strongly disagree with Lucas, who writes, “Future research using the multilevel model should be limited to cases that satisfy the sample requirements described. [sent-34, score-1.126]
</p><p>20 ”  Random samples are great, and I admire Lucas’s thoughtful skepticism, but when we want to analyze data that are  not  random samples, I think it’s better to face up to the statistical difficulties and model them directly rather than running away from the problem. [sent-35, score-0.517]

We are analyzing multilevel models of the probability of using cancer screening for the entire Medicare population.

How would you explain, to a “classically-trained” hypothesis-tester, that “It’s OK to fit a multilevel model even if some groups have only one observation each”?


I [O'Brien] think I understand the logic and the statistical principles at work in this, but I’ve having trouble being clear and persuasive. I also feel like I’m contending with some methodological conventional wisdom here. 
  
My reply:  I’m so used to this idea that I find it difficult to defend it in some sort of general conceptual way.  So let me retreat to a more functional defense, which is that multilevel modeling gives good estimates,  especially  when the number of observations per group is small.
 
One way to see this in any particular example in through cross-validation.  Another way is to consider the alternatives.   If you try really hard you can come up with a “classical hypothesis testing” approach which will do as well as the multilevel model.  It would just take a lot of work.

In a previous post, http://andrewgelman.com/2013/07/30/the-roy-causal-model/ you pointed to a paper on Bayesian methods by Heckman. At around the same time I came across another one of his papers, “The Effects of Cognitive and Noncognitive Abilities on Labor Market Outcomes and Social Behavior (2006)” (http://www.nber.org/papers/w12006 or published version http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/504455). In this paper they implement their model as follows:

 
We use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to compute the sample likelihood. Our use of Bayesian methods is only a computational convenience. Our identification analysis is strictly classical. Under our assumptions, the priors we use are asymptotically irrelevant.

I’d like to request general feedback and references for a problem of combining disparate data sources in a regression model. We’d like to model log crop yield as a function of environmental predictors, but the observations come from many data sources and are peculiarly structured. Among the issues are:


1. Measurement precision in predictors and outcome varies widely with data sources. Some observations are in very coarse units of measurement, due to rounding or even observer guesswork. 


2. There are obvious clusters of observations arising from studies in which crop yields were monitored over successive years in spatially proximate communities. Thus some variables may be constant within clusters–this is true even for log yield, probably due to rounding of similar yields. 


3. Cluster size and intra-cluster association structure (temporal, spatial or both) vary widely across the dataset.

I am using a multilevel model with three levels. I read that you wrote a book about multilevel models, and wonder if you can solve the following question.  


The data structure is like this: 


Level one: customer (8444 customers) 
Level two: companys (90 companies) 
Level three: industry (17 industries) 


I use 6 level-three variables (i.e. industry characteristics) to explain the variance of the level-one effect across industries. The question here is whether there is an over-fitting problem since there are only 17 industries. I understand that this must be a problem for non-multilevel models, but is it also a problem for multilevel models?
  
My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.  This is an interesting and important area of statistics research, to do this sort of thing systematically.  There’s lots o</p><p>5 0.77962363 <a title="1934-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-Multilevel_modeling_even_when_you%E2%80%99re_not_interested_in_predictions_for_new_groups.html">1194 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-Multilevel modeling even when you’re not interested in predictions for new groups</a></p>

I work at National Prescribing Services in Australia.  I have a database representing say, antidiabetic drug utilisation for the entire Australia in the past few years. I planned to do a longitudinal analysis across GP Division Network (112 divisions in AUS) using mixed-effects models (or as you called in your book varying intercept and varying slope) on this data. 


The problem here is: as data actually represent the population who use antidiabetic drugs in AUS, should I use 112 fixed dummy variables to capture the random variations or use varying intercept and varying slope for the model ? Because some one may aruge, like divisions in AUS or states in USA can hardly be considered from a “superpopulation”, then fixed dummies should be used.  What I think is the population are those who use the drugs, what will happen when the rest need to use them? In terms of exchangeability, using varying intercept and varying slopes can be justified.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a post  by Sean Taylor, who writes the following about users of R:
  
You are willing to invest in learning something difficult.  You do not care about aesthetics, only availability of packages and getting results quickly.
  
To me, R is easy and Sas is difficult.  I once worked with some students who were running Sas and the output was unreadable!  Pages and pages of numbers that made no sense.  When it comes to ease or difficulty of use, I think it depends on what you’re used to!  And I really don’t understand the bit about aesthetics.  What about  this ?  One reason I use R is to make pretty graphs.  That said, if I’d never learned R, I’d just be making pretty graphs in Fortran or whatever.  My guess is, the way I program, R is actually hindering rather than helping my ability to make attractive graphs.  Half the time I’m scrambling around, writing custom code to get around R’s defaults.</p><p>2 0.97864008 <a title="1934-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins  writes :
  
When native Australians or New Guineans say that their totemic animals and plants are their kinsmen – that these species are persons like themselves, and that in offering them to others they are giving away part of their own substance – we have to take them seriously, which is to say empirically, if we want to understand the large consequences of these facts for how they organise their lives. The graveyard of ethnographic studies is strewn with the remains of reports which, thanks to anthropologists’ own presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact, were content to ignore or debunk the Amazonian peoples who said that the animals they hunted were their brothers-in-law, the Africans who described the way they systematically killed their kings when they became weak, or the Fijian chiefs who claimed they were gods.
  
My first thought was . . . wait a minute!  Whazzat with “presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact”?

<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.

<p>Introduction: A sociologist writes in:
  
Samuel Lucas has just published  a paper  in Quality and Quantity arguing that anything less than a full probability sample of higher levels in HLMs yields biased and unusable results. If I follow him correctly, he is arguing that not only are the SEs too small, but the parameter estimates themselves are biased and we cannot say in advance whether the bias is positive or negative.


Lucas has thrown down a big gauntlet, advising us throw away our data unless the sample of macro units is right and ignore the published results that fail this standard. Extreme. 
Is there another conclusion to be drawn? 
Other advice to be given? 
A Bayesian path out of the valley?
  
Heres’s the abstract to Lucas’s paper:

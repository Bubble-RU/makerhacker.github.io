<p>Introduction: A journalist asked me for my thoughts on academics and blogging, in light of the  recently announced  move of the sister blog to the Washington Post.  I responded as follows: 
  
  
John Sides is the leader of the Monkey Cage and in particular was the key person involved in the Washington Post move.


But I will give you some general comments based on my own experiences.


I started blogging in 2004:  Samantha Cook (my postdoc at the time) and I set up the blog so that we could communicate our partially-formed research ideas to each other, in a way that would be open to the world so that (a) we could get input from interested outsiders, and (b) we could publicize our work.  We decided to post daily (or approximately thus).  At the time, I figured that if there was ever a time that we ran out of material, I could post summaries of my old research papers.


The blog quickly became a place for us to give our various thoughts on statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science.</p><p>3 0.16311336 <a title="2048-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-26-Teaching_evaluations%2C_instructor_effectiveness%2C_the_Journal_of_Political_Economy%2C_and_the_Holy_Roman_Empire.html">540 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-26-Teaching evaluations, instructor effectiveness, the Journal of Political Economy, and the Holy Roman Empire</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joan Nix writes:
  
Your comments on  this paper by Scott Carrell and James West  would be most appreciated.  I’m afraid the conclusions of this paper are too strong given the data set and other plausible explanations. But given where it is published, this paper is receiving and will continue to receive lots of attention. It will be used to draw deeper conclusions regarding effective teaching and experience. 
  
Nix also links to  this discussion  by Jeff Ely.
 
I don’t completely follow Ely’s criticism, which seems to me to be too clever by half, but I agree with Nix that the findings in the research article don’t seem to fit together very well.  For example, Carrell and West estimate that the effects of instructors on performance in the follow-on class is as large as the effects on the class they’re teaching.  This seems hard to believe, and it seems central enough to their story that I don’t know what to think about everything else in the paper.

I have mixed feelings about the move of the Monkey Cage blog to the Washington Post.  I’ve been told we get many more readers, but the the comments have declined in number and in quality.  It used to be that posting at the Monkey Cage felt like “blogging”:  I’d post something there and look at the comments.  It was a political science community with many participants from outside the field.  Posting at the new blog is more like writing for the newspaper:  it’s a broadcast without real feedback.  This all makes me realize how much I appreciate the commenters here.  Just as I blog for free, out</p><p>5 0.12163604 <a title="2048-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-02-Automating_my_graphics_advice.html">443 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-02-Automating my graphics advice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After seeing  this graph :
 
   
 
I have the following message for Sharad:
 
Rotate the graph 90 degrees so you can see the words.  Also you can ditch the lines.  Then what you have is a dotplot, following the principles of Cleveland (1985).  You can lay out a few on one page to see some interactions with demographics.
 
 The real challenge here . . . 
 
. . . is to automate this sort of advice.  Or maybe we just need a really nice dotplot() function and enough examples, and people will start doing it?
 
 P.S. 
 
Often a lineplot is better.  See  here  for a discussion of another Sharad example.</p><p>6 0.11994603 <a title="2048-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-20-Bugs_Bunny%2C_the_governor_of_Massachusetts%2C_the_Dow_36%2C000_guy%2C_presidential_qualifications%2C_and_Peggy_Noonan.html">1129 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-20-Bugs Bunny, the governor of Massachusetts, the Dow 36,000 guy, presidential qualifications, and Peggy Noonan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The sister blog has  moved  to the Washington Post.  It’s harder to leave comments there, so I’ll post my comments to Monkey Cage posts here instead.
 
Political scientist Lisa Martin wrote  a post  on student evaluations of teaching, based on  a recent paper  where she writes:

As a statistician, I always like to hear this sort of moderate statement.  On the blog, Martin shows the following graph based on data from the political science departments of “publicly available SET data from two large public universities, one in the South and the other on the West Coast”:

<p>Introduction: Here’s a good one if you want to tell your students about question wording bias.  It’s fun because the data are all on the web–the research is something that students could do on their own–if they know what to look for.  Another win for Google.
 
Here’s the story.  I found the following graph on the front page of the American Enterprise Institute, a well-known D.C. think tank:
 
 
 
My first thought was that they should replace this graph by a time series, which would show so much more information.  I did a web search and, indeed, looking at a broad range of poll questions over time gives us a much richer perspective on public opinion about Afghanistan than is revealed in the above graph.
 
I did a quick google search (“polling report afghanistan”) and found  this .  The quick summary is that roughly 40% of Americans favor the Afghan war (down from about 50% from 2006 through early 2009).
 
The Polling Report page also features the Quninipiac poll featured in the above graph; here it r</p><p>3 0.63203549 <a title="2048-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-12-Simple_graph_WIN%3A__the_example_of_birthday_frequencies.html">1376 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-12-Simple graph WIN:  the example of birthday frequencies</a></p>

The data come from the Center for Disease Control and cover the years 1969-1988. Chris also gives instructions for how to download the data and plot them in R from scratch (in 30 lines of R code)!
 
 And now, the background 
 
A few months ago I heard about a study reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days:
 
   
 
I  wrote ,
  
What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns. While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates. It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.
  
I was pointed to some tables:

You’ve probably seen  this  [by Matthew Hankins]. . . . Everyone else on Twitter already has. It’s a graph of the frequency with which the phrase “marginally significant” occurs in association with  different P values. Apparently it’s real data, from a Google Scholar search, though I haven’t tried to replicate the search myself.
  
 
 
My reply:  I admire the effort that went into the data collection and the excellent display (following Bill Cleveland etc., I’d prefer a landscape rather than portrait orientation of the graph, also I’d prefer a gritty histogram rather than a smooth density, and I don’t like the y-axis going below zero, nor do I like the box around the graph, also there’s that weird R default where the axis labels are so far from the actual axes, I don’t know whassup with that . . . but these are all minor, minor issues, certainly I’ve done much worse myself many times even in published articles; see the presentation  here  for lots of examples), an</p><p>5 0.6257242 <a title="2048-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-14-Extra_babies_on_Valentine%E2%80%99s_Day%2C_fewer_on_Halloween%3F.html">1167 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-14-Extra babies on Valentine’s Day, fewer on Halloween?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The sister blog has  moved  to the Washington Post.  It’s harder to leave comments there, so I’ll post my comments to Monkey Cage posts here instead.
 
Political scientist Lisa Martin wrote  a post  on student evaluations of teaching, based on  a recent paper  where she writes:
  
Many female faculty believe that they face prejudice in student evaluations of teaching (SETs), and that this prejudice may be exaggerated by developments such as online evaluations and the prevalence of sites such as RateMyProfessor. However, systematic studies of SETs are mixed in their findings of gender bias.
  
As a statistician, I always like to hear this sort of moderate statement.  On the blog, Martin shows the following graph based on data from the political science departments of “publicly available SET data from two large public universities, one in the South and the other on the West Coast”:
 
 
 
The graph left me with two questions and a comment:

<p>Introduction: Richard Morey writes:
  
Rink Hoekstra and I are undertaking some research to explore how people use classical statistical results to evaluate the weight of evidence. Bayesians often critique classical techniques for being difficult to interpret in terms of what scientists want to know, but there is clearly information in the statistics themselves. We wonder how people extract that information. Below is our official announcement; it would be great if you could let people on your blog know about the survey, as we want to get a wide variety of statistical users to take the survey.


Announcement follows:

 
Empirical science is grounded on the belief that data can be used as evidence. The convincingness of data — the “weight” of the evidence they provide — is crucial to deciding between rival scientific positions. In situations with no uncertainty, reasoning about evidence is often straightforward; in practice, however, most conclusions from data involve uncertainty. In these situations,</p><p>3 0.9555521 <a title="2048-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-24-Sometimes_the_raw_numbers_are_better_than_a_percentage.html">108 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-24-Sometimes the raw numbers are better than a percentage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  NY Times Environment blog entry  summarizes an  article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  that looks into whether there really is a “scientific consensus” that humans are substantially changing the climate.  There is.  That’s pretty much “dog bites man” as far as news is concerned.  But although the results of the study don’t seem noteworthy, I was struck by this paragraph in the blog writeup, which is pretty much a quote of the PNAS article:
  
For example, of the top 50 climate researchers identified by the study (as ranked by the number of papers they had published), only 2 percent fell into the camp of climate dissenters. Of the top 200 researchers, only 2.5 percent fell into the dissenter camp. That is consistent with past work, including opinion polls, suggesting that 97 to 98 percent of working climate scientists accept the evidence for human-induced climate change.
  
Two percent of the top 50, that’s one person.  And 2.5 percent of the top 200, that’s five</p><p>4 0.95549005 <a title="2048-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-18-Predictive_checks_for_hierarchical_models.html">154 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-18-Predictive checks for hierarchical models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Corsi writes:
  
I was wondering if you could help me with some code to set up a posterior predictive check for an unordered multinomial multilevel model.  In this case the outcome is categories of bmi (underweight, nomral weight, and overweight) based on individuals from 360 different areas. What I would like to do is set up a replicated dataset  to see how the number of overweight/underweight/normal weight individuals based on the model compares to the actual data and some kind of a graphical summary. I am following along with chapter 24 of the arm book but I want to verify that the replicated data accounts for the multilevel structure of the data of people within areas. I am attaching the code I used to run a simple model with only 2 predictors (area wealth and urban/rural designation).
  
My reply:  The Bugs code is a bit much for me to look at–but I do recommend that you run it from R, which will give you more flexibility in preprocessing and postprocessing the data.

<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .
  
OK, fine, so individual creatives aren’t doing so well?  But what about the larger urban economies?

Two of the present authors, Motyl and Nosek, share interests in political ideology. We were inspired by the fast growing literature on embodiment that demonstrates surprising links between body and mind (Markman & Brendl, 2005; Proffitt, 2006) to investigate embodiment of political extremism. Participants from the political left, right and center (N = 1,979) completed a perceptual judgment task in which words were presented in different shades of gray. Participants had to click along a gradient representing grays from near black to near white to select a shade that matched the shade of the word. We calculated accuracy: How close to the actual shade did participants get? The results were stunning.

<p>Introduction: Two people separately sent me  this amusing mock-research paper  by Brian A. Nosek (I assume that’s what’s meant by “Arina K. Bones”).  The article is pretty funny, but  this poster  (by Nosek and Samuel Gosling) is even better!  Check it out:
 
   
 
   
 
I remarked that this was almost as good as my zombies paper, and my correspondent pointed me to  this page  of (I assume) Nosek’s research on aliens.
 
P.S.  I clicked through to take  the test  to see if I’m dead or alive, but I got bored after a few minutes.  I gotta say, if Gosling can  come up with  a 10-item measure of the Big Five, this crew should be able to come up with a reasonably valid alive-or-dead test that doesn’t require dozens and dozens of questions!</p><p>3 0.12573883 <a title="1959-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-18-You%E2%80%99ll_get_a_high_Type_S_error_rate_if_you_use_classical_statistical_methods_to_analyze_data_from_underpowered_studies.html">1944 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-18-You’ll get a high Type S error rate if you use classical statistical methods to analyze data from underpowered studies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan sends me  this article  from the research-methods all-star team of Katherine Button, John Ioannidis, Claire Mokrysz,  Brian Nosek , Jonathan Flint, Emma Robinson, and Marcus Munafo:
  
A study with low statistical power has a reduced chance of detecting a true effect, but it is less well appreciated that low power also reduces the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect. Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but often ignored methodological principles.
  
I agree completely.  In my terminology, with small sample size, the classical approach of looking for statistical significance leads</p><p>4 0.1172635 <a title="1959-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-31-How_to_fix_the_tabloids%3F__Toward_replicable_social_science_research.html">1878 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-31-How to fix the tabloids?

<p>Introduction: This seems to be the topic of the week.  Yesterday I posted on the sister blog  some further thoughts  on those “Psychological Science” papers on menstrual cycles, biceps size, and political attitudes, tied to a horrible press release from the journal Psychological Science hyping the biceps and politics study.
 
Then I was pointed to these  suggestions  from Richard Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan have on improving the replicability and reproducibility of research published in the Journal of Research in Personality:
  
It goes without saying that editors of scientific journals strive to publish research that is not only theoretically interesting but also methodologically rigorous. The goal is to select papers that advance the field. Accordingly, editors want to publish findings that can be reproduced and replicated by other scientists. Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>5 0.11498956 <a title="1959-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-31-Response_by_Jessica_Tracy_and_Alec_Beall_to_my_critique_of_the_methods_in_their_paper%2C_%E2%80%9CWomen_Are_More_Likely_to_Wear_Red_or_Pink_at_Peak_Fertility%E2%80%9D.html">1963 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-31-Response by Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall to my critique of the methods in their paper, “Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.  I likened their paper to other work which I considered flawed for multiple comparisons (too many researcher degrees of freedom), including a claimed relation bet</p><p>6 0.10751383 <a title="1959-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-17-Replication_backlash.html">2137 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-17-Replication backlash</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the key insights of game theory is to solve problems in reverse time order.  You first figure out what you would do in the endgame, then decide a middle-game strategy to get you where you want to be at the end, then you choose an opening that will take you on your desired path.  All conditional on what the other players do in their turn.
 
In an  article  from 1989, “Meta-analysis in medical research:  Strong encouragement for higher quality in individual research efforts,” Keith O’Rourke and Allan Detsky apply this principle to the process of publication of scientific research: 
  
  
From the statistical point of view, there really is no escape from performing a de facto meta-analysis. One can either judge the effectiveness of a therapy based solely on the most recent study and ignore all previous studies, a method which is equivalent to giving the most recent study weight 1.Oand all previous studies weight 0, or try to choose the weights on some scientific basis . . .

<p>Introduction: The traditional system of scientific and scholarly publishing is breaking down in two different directions.
 
On one hand, we are moving away from relying on a small set of journals as gatekeepers: the number of papers and research projects is increasing, the number of publication outlets is increasing, and important manuscripts are being posted on SSRN, Arxiv, and other nonrefereed sites.
 
At the same time, many researchers are worried about the profusion of published claims that turn out to not replicate or in plain language, to be false. This concern is not new–some prominent discussions include Rosenthal (1979), Ioannidis (2005), and Vul et al. (2009)–but there is a growing sense that the scientific signal is being swamped by noise.
 
I recently had the opportunity to comment in the journal Political Analysis on two papers, one by Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt, and one by Monogan, on the preregistration of studies and mock reports.   Here’s  the issue of the journal.

Unfortunately, there has been a recent “crisis in confidence” among psychologists about the quality of psychological research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012)</p><p>5 0.81553376 <a title="1959-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-31-Response_by_Jessica_Tracy_and_Alec_Beall_to_my_critique_of_the_methods_in_their_paper%2C_%E2%80%9CWomen_Are_More_Likely_to_Wear_Red_or_Pink_at_Peak_Fertility%E2%80%9D.html">1963 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-31-Response by Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall to my critique of the methods in their paper, “Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.  I likened their paper to other work which I considered flawed for multiple comparisons (too many researcher degrees of freedom), including a claimed relation bet</p><p>6 0.80217791 <a title="1959-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-22-Ticket_to_Baaaaarf.html">2301 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-22-Ticket to Baaaaarf</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a killer story  (from Brian Nosek, Jeffrey Spies, and Matt Motyl).
 
Part 1:
  
Two of the present authors, Motyl and Nosek, share interests in political ideology. We were inspired by the fast growing literature on embodiment that demonstrates surprising links between body and mind (Markman & Brendl, 2005; Proffitt, 2006) to investigate embodiment of political extremism. Participants from the political left, right and center (N = 1,979) completed a perceptual judgment task in which words were presented in different shades of gray. Participants had to click along a gradient representing grays from near black to near white to select a shade that matched the shade of the word. We calculated accuracy: How close to the actual shade did participants get? The results were stunning. Moderates perceived the shades of gray more accurately than extremists on the left and right (p = .01). Our conclusion: political extremists perceive the world in black-and-white, figuratively and literally</p><p>2 0.91559923 <a title="1959-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-27-%E2%80%9CGet_off_my_lawn%E2%80%9D-blogging.html">1432 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-27-“Get off my lawn”-blogging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jay Livingston  critiques  the recent pronouncements of sociologist and  cigarette shill  Peter Berger, who recently has moved into cultural criticism of New York’s mayor for living with “a woman to whom he is not married” (this is apparently a European sort of thing, I guess they don’t have unmarried partners in the parts of the U.S. where Berger hangs out).
 
But what impresses me is that Berger is doing  regular blogging   at the age of 84 , writing a long essay each week.  That’s really amazing to me.  Some of the blogging is a bit suspect, for example  the bit  where he claims that he personally could convert gays to heterosexual orientation (“A few stubborn individuals may resist the Berger conversion program. The majority will succumb”)—but, really, you gotta admire that he’s doing this.  I hope I’m that active when (if) I reach my mid-80s.  (As a nonsmoker, I should have a pretty good chance of reaching that point.)
 
P.S.   More rant  at the sister blog.

<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>4 0.88713241 <a title="1959-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-13-Infographic_on_the_economy.html">1116 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-13-Infographic on the economy</a></p>

I like it.  Would it be possible to put the two long time series on the same scale?  As it is, one starts in 1948 and the other starts in 1980.  The only thing about the display that I really  don’t  like are those balls on the top indicating the duration of recessions.  It looks weird to me to display a time duration in the form of the area of a ball.</p><p>5 0.88571441 <a title="1959-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-Stand_Your_Ground_laws_and_homicides.html">1397 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-Stand Your Ground laws and homicides</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

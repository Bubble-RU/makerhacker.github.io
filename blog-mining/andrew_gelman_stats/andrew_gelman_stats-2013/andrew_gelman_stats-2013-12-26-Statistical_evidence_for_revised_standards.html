I think he  (and also Christian Robert) raise a number of interesting points concerning this new class of Bayesian tests, but I think that they may have confounded several issues that might more usefully be examined separately.


The first issue involves the choice of the Bayesian evidence threshold, gamma, used in rejecting a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.  Andrew objects to the higher values of gamma proposed in my recent PNAS article on grounds that too many important scientific effects would be missed if thresholds of 25-50 were routinely used.

</p><p>6 Of course, the evidence threshold that one chooses for declaring a scientific discovery is an inherently subjective choice, and arguments that higher false positive rates should be accepted in order to avoid missing true effects can certainly be made. [sent-16, score-1.074]
</p><p>7 Regardless of the evidence threshold that one chooses, I think it is important to separate the choice of this threshold from the method that is used to determine the form of the alternative hypothesis that is specified. [sent-19, score-1.241]
</p><p>8 Instead of classifying these tests as minimax procedures, I think it is more appropriate to regard them as Bayesian analogs of most powerful tests (hence their name). [sent-29, score-0.462]
</p><p>9 Simply put, UMPBTs are the class of objective Bayesian hypothesis tests that maximize the probability that the Bayes factor in favor of the alternative hypothesis exceeds a specified threshold. [sent-30, score-0.875]
</p><p>10 Given that an evidence threshold has been agreed upon, the objection to UMPBTs on the basis that they lead to high rates of false negatives therefore seems misguided. [sent-31, score-0.857]

</p><p>17 When the sample size is increased to obtain a higher degree of certainty regarding the validity of competing hypotheses, then the apparent paradox again disappears because the alternative hypothesis specified under the UMPBT does not collapse onto the null value. [sent-49, score-1.007]

Christian Robert and I were unconvinced by Val’s reasoning and wrote a  response , “Revised evidence for statistical standards,” in which we wrote:

<p>Introduction: X  and I heard about  this  much-publicized recent paper by Val Johnson, who suggests changing the default level of statistical significance from z=2 to z=3 (or, as he puts it, going from p=.05 to p=.005 or .001).  Val argues that you need to go out to 3 standard errors to get a Bayes factor of 25 or 50 in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  I don’t really buy this, first because Val’s model is a weird (to me) mixture of two point masses, which he creates in order to make a minimax argument, and second because I don’t see why you need a Bayes factor of 25 to 50 in order to make a claim.  I’d think that a factor of 5:1, say, provides strong information already—if you really believe those odds.  The real issue, as I see it, is that we’re getting Bayes factors and posterior probabilities we don’t believe, because we’re assuming flat priors that don’t really make sense.  This is a topic that’s come up over and over in recent months on this blog, for example in this discussion of why I  d</p><p>4 0.2431225 <a title="2149-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed_or_two-tailed%3F.html">2295 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed or two-tailed?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: Ken Rice writes:
  
In the recent discussion on  stopping rules  I saw a comment that I wanted to chip in on, but thought it might get a bit lost, in the already long thread. Apologies in advance if I misinterpreted what you wrote, or am trying to tell you things you already know.


 The comment  was: “In Bayesian decision making, there is a utility function and you choose the decision with highest expected utility. Making a decision based on statistical significance does not correspond to any utility function.”


… which immediately suggests  this  little 2010 paper; A Decision-Theoretic Formulation of Fisher’s Approach to Testing, The American Statistician, 64(4) 345-349. It contains utilities that lead to decisions that very closely mimic classical Wald tests, and provides a rationale for why this utility is not totally unconnected from how some scientists think. Some (old) slides discussing it  are here .

<p>Introduction: Sam Seaver writes:
  
I [Seaver] happened to be reading an ironic  article  by Karl Friston when I learned something new about frequentist vs bayesian, namely Lindley’s paradox, on page 12.  The text is as follows:

 
So why are we worried about trivial effects? They are important because the probability that the true effect size is exactly zero is itself zero and could cause us to reject the null hypothesis inappropriately. This is a fallacy of classical inference and is not unrelated to Lindley’s paradox (Lindley 1957). Lindley’s paradox describes a counterintuitive situation in which Bayesian and frequentist approaches to hypothesis testing give opposite results. It occurs when; (i) a result is significant by a frequentist test, indicating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis d=0 and (ii) priors render the posterior probability of d=0 high, indicating strong evidence that the null hypothesis is true.

treatment, Lindley (1957) showed that – under a parti</p><p>4 0.82092822 <a title="2149-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed_or_two-tailed%3F.html">2295 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-18-One-tailed or two-tailed?</a></p>

I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

In the recent discussion on  stopping rules  I saw a comment that I wanted to chip in on, but thought it might get a bit lost, in the already long thread. Apologies in advance if I misinterpreted what you wrote, or am trying to tell you things you already know.


 The comment  was: “In Bayesian decision making, there is a utility function and you choose the decision with highest expected utility. Making a decision based on statistical significance does not correspond to any utility function.”


… which immediately suggests  this  little 2010 paper; A Decision-Theoretic Formulation of Fisher’s Approach to Testing, The American Statistician, 64(4) 345-349. It contains utilities that lead to decisions that very closely mimic classical Wald tests, and provides a rationale for why this utility is not totally unconnected from how some scientists think. Some (old) slides discussing it  are here .

<p>Introduction: In response to the  discussion  of X and me of his recent  paper , Val Johnson writes:
  
I would like to thank Andrew for forwarding his comments on uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests (UMPBTs) to me and his invitation to respond to them.  I think he  (and also Christian Robert) raise a number of interesting points concerning this new class of Bayesian tests, but I think that they may have confounded several issues that might more usefully be examined separately.


The first issue involves the choice of the Bayesian evidence threshold, gamma, used in rejecting a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.  Andrew objects to the higher values of gamma proposed in my recent PNAS article on grounds that too many important scientific effects would be missed if thresholds of 25-50 were routinely used.  These evidence thresholds correspond roughly to p-values of 0.005; Andrew suggests that evidence thresholds around 5 should continue to be used (gamma=5 corresponds approximate</p><p>2 0.97140002 <a title="2149-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-31-Using_sample_size_in_the_prior_distribution.html">547 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-31-Using sample size in the prior distribution</a></p>

Consider the Seeds example in vol. 1 of the BUGS examples.  There, a binomial likelihood has a p parameter constructed, via logit, from two covariates.  What I am wondering is: Would it be legitimate, in a binomial + logit problem like this, to allow binomial p[i] to be a function of the corresponding n[i] or would that amount to using the data in the prior?  In other words, in the context of the Seeds example, is r[] the only data or is n[] data as well and therefore not permissible in a prior formulation?


I [McLaughlin] currently have a model with a common beta prior for all p[i] but would like to mitigate this commonality (a kind of James-Stein effect) when there are lots of observations for some i.  But this seems to feed the data back into the prior.  Does it really?


It also occurs to me [McLaughlin] that, perhaps, a binomial likelihood is not the one to use here (not flexible enough).

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, a few months ago Val Johnson  published  an article, “Revised standards for statistical evidence,” making a Bayesian argument that researchers and journals should use a p=0.005 publication threshold rather than the usual p=0.05.
 
Christian Robert and I were unconvinced by Val’s reasoning and wrote a  response , “Revised evidence for statistical standards,” in which we wrote:
  
Johnson’s minimax prior is not intended to correspond to any distribution of effect sizes; rather, it represents a worst case scenario under some mathematical assumptions. Minimax and tradeoffs do well together, and it is hard for us to see how any worst case procedure can supply much guidance on how to balance between two different losses. . . .


We would argue that the appropriate significance level depends on the scenario and that what worked well for agricultural experiments in the 1920s might not be so appropriate for many applications in modern biosciences . . .</p><p>4 0.95382035 <a title="2149-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-15-Reputations_changeable%2C_situations_tolerable.html">1858 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-15-Reputations changeable, situations tolerable</a></p>

Marginally specified priors for nonparametric Bayesian estimation


Prior specification for nonparametric Bayesian inference involves the difficult task of quantifying prior knowledge about a parameter of high, often infinite, dimension. Realistically, a statistician is unlikely to have informed opinions about all aspects of such a parameter, but may have real information about functionals of the parameter, such the population mean or variance. This article proposes a new framework for nonparametric Bayes inference in which the prior distribution for a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter is decomposed into two parts: an informative prior on a finite set of functionals, and a nonparametric conditional prior for the parameter given the functionals. Such priors can be easily constructed from standard nonparametric prior distributions in common use, and inherit the large support of the standard priors upon which they are based.

I thought I had read on your blog that bar charts should always include zero on the scale, but a search of your blog (or google) didn’t return what I was looking for.  Is it considered a best practice to always include zero on the axis for bar charts?  Has this been written in a book?
  
My reply:
 
The idea is that the area of the bar represents “how many” or “how much.” The bar has to go down to 0 for that to work.  You don’t have to have your y-axis go to zero, but if you want the axis to go anywhere else, don’t use a bar graph, use a line graph.  Usually line graphs are better anyway.

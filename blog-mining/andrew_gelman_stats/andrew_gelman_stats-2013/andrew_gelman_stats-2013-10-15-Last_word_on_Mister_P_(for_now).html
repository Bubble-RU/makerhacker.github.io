[sent-7, score-0.74]
</p><p>2 But I think the variation and degree of performance failure are overstated in BH. [sent-11, score-0.387]
</p><p>3 BH argue that using the disaggregated survey (CCES) values themselves is a good enough measure of truth to make strong claims about variability and the degree of pessimism one should have. [sent-16, score-0.579]
</p><p>4 But BH set aside all noise in their estimates of truth and counted that against MRP performance. [sent-19, score-0.352]
</p><p>5 Calculating simple disaggregated state means of CCES samples of size 25 to 40K still makes for noisy estimates of truth, particularly for the smaller states. [sent-20, score-0.409]
</p><p>6 Indeed, truth for too many states is still then calculated using uncomfortably small samples. [sent-21, score-0.384]
</p><p>7 ) The reliability of such estimates of “truth” using CCES data ranges from around . [sent-23, score-0.357]
</p><p>8 This means also that comparisons across questions in BH are called into doubt, since the reliability adjustment ALSO varies across question. [sent-27, score-0.217]
</p><p>9 Adjusting for reliability, MRP performance is significantly higher and variability lower than reported in BH. [sent-28, score-0.229]
</p><p>10 Beyond this, one also has noisy estimates of the poststratification weights used for MRP (Ghitza’s point). [sent-31, score-0.431]
</p><p>11 Even setting aside this point (more on it later), when one adjusts for the demonstrated degree of reliability in the estimate of truth, MRP performance is higher than BH report (by a third) and variation reduced. [sent-32, score-0.544]
</p><p>12 Another reason BH overstate MRP performance variability and negative performance is that they implicitly assume a researcher just blindly runs MRP without looking at either the model or the estimates to see if they make sense, etc. [sent-42, score-0.588]
</p><p>13 Ghitza further argues—and this is separate from our reliability correction—that the poststratification weights are also only sampled with error and that one can use MRP on the large samples to get better measures of truth, etc. [sent-45, score-0.452]
</p><p>14 However, any claims about the degree of variation and degree of performance failure need to be clearly labeled as inflated estimates thereof, or upper bounds perhaps, given that the noisiness of “truth” is being set aside. [sent-53, score-0.67]
</p><p>15 Or one can do what we now do and adjust for reliability using standard methods for such. [sent-54, score-0.256]
</p><p>16 We are running additional simulations to show whether using standard Census data for poststratification (rather than CCES sample weights) leads to better MRP performance even for CCES-based estimates. [sent-57, score-0.386]
</p><p>17 That is, even if one doesn’t use MRP to determine truth as Ghitza suggests, one could use Census weights on the MRP estimates, as is usually done. [sent-58, score-0.394]
</p><p>18 One need not have access to true opinion to have a reasonable predictor of state-level opinion or state random effects in MRP’s multilevel modeling stage. [sent-64, score-0.295]
</p><p>19 Here’s Jeff’s summary:    MRP performance is better and less variable than Buttice and Highton reported in their paper, but they are absolutely right that variation remains and that performance is imperfect. [sent-65, score-0.488]
</p><p>20 We hope that no one forgets that MRP estimates are still only estimates of true state opinion and that one must do MRP with attention and care (the newly revised MRP package and our forthcoming diagnostics should help with this). [sent-66, score-0.767]

<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science—and soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It’s taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power—as well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.
 
As a method becomes used more and more widely, there will be natural concerns about its domains of applicability.  That is the subject of the pres</p><p>3 0.57507515 <a title="2062-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-14-More_on_Mister_P_and_how_it_does_what_it_does.html">2061 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-14-More on Mister P and how it does what it does</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>6 0.19522269 <a title="2062-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-Question_26_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1367 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-Question 26 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

Ideally, the published paper would include a link to these discussions of Highton, Buttice, Lax, Phillips, and Ghitza, so that readers would automatically get all this information.</p><p>5 0.71923876 <a title="2062-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Question_25_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1365 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Question 25 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>6 0.63405877 <a title="2062-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-17-Distorting_the_Electoral_Connection%3F_Partisan_Representation_in_Confirmation_Politics.html">152 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-17-Distorting the Electoral Connection?

<p>Introduction: OK, here’s something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who’s famous for his innovative treatment for “phantom limb” pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . “Oh, my God!” the man began</p><p>2 0.90436208 <a title="2062-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-Improvements_to_Kindle_Version_of_BDA3.html">1993 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-Improvements to Kindle Version of BDA3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90395874 <a title="2062-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-15-Last_word_on_Mister_P_%28for_now%29.html">2062 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-15-Last word on Mister P (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To recap:
 
Matt Buttice and Ben Highton recently published  an article  where they evaluated multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) on a bunch of political examples estimating state-level attitudes.
 
My Columbia colleagues Jeff Lax, Justin Phillips, and Yair Ghitza added some  discussion , giving a bunch of practical tips and pointing to some problems with Buttice and Highton’s evaluations.
 
Buttice and Highton  replied , emphasizing the difficulties of comparing methods in the absence of a known ground truth.
 
And Jeff Lax added the following comment, which I think is a good overview of the discussion so far:
  
In the back and forth between us all on details, some points may get lost and disagreements overstated. Where are things at this point?


1.	Buttice and Highton (BH) show beyond previous work that MRP performance in making state estimates can vary to an extent that is not directly observable unless one knows the true estimates (in which case one would not be us</p><p>4 0.90366948 <a title="2062-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual 
 
If you’d like to learn more, the   Stan User’s Guide and Reference Manual   is the place to start.</p><p>5 0.8892374 <a title="2062-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The above is the title of  a talk  that Thad Tarpey gave at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2009.  Here’s the abstract:
  
Students of statistics are often introduced to George Box’s famous quote: “all models are wrong, some are useful.” In this talk I [Tarpey] argue that this quote, although useful, is wrong. A different and more positive perspective is to acknowledge that a model is simply a means of extracting information of interest from data. The truth is infinitely complex and a model is merely an approximation to the truth. If the approximation is poor or misleading, then the model is useless. In this talk I give examples of correct models that are not true models. I illustrate how the notion of a “wrong” model can lead to wrong conclusions.
  
I’m curious what he had to say—maybe he could post the slides?

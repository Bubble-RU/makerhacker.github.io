<p>Introduction: Here is my discussion of  a recent article  by David Spiegelhalter, Christopher 
Sherlaw-Johnson, Martin Bardsley, Ian Blunt, Christopher Wood and Olivia Grigg, that is scheduled to appear in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
 
I applaud the authors’ use of a mix of statistical methods to attack an important real-world problem. Policymakers need results right away, and I admire the authors’ ability and willingness to combine several different modeling and significance testing ideas for the purposes of rating and surveillance.
 
That said, I am uncomfortable with the statistical ideas here, for three reasons. First, I feel that the proposed methods, centered as they are around data manipulation and corrections for uncertainty, has serious defects compared to a more model-based approach. My problem with methods based on p-values and z-scores–however they happen to be adjusted–is that they draw discussion toward error rates, sequential analysis, and other technical statistical</p><p>3 0.0868228 <a title="2076-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Amtrak_sucks.html">1255 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Amtrak sucks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reed Abelson and Gardiner Harris  report  in the New York Times that some serious statistical questions have been raised about the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, an influential project that reports huge differences in health care costs and practices in different places in the United States, suggesting large potential cost savings if more efficient practices are used.  (A claim that is certainly plausible to me, given  this notorious graph ; see  here  for background.)
 
Here’s an example of a claim from the  Dartmouth Atlas  (just picking something that happens to be featured on their webpage right now):
  
Medicare beneficiaries who move to some regions receive many more diagnostic tests and new diagnoses than those who move to other regions. This study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, raises important questions about whether being given more diagnoses is beneficial to patients and may help to explain recent controversies about regional differences in spending.

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
I was re-reading your and Shalizi’s  “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics”  [see also the  rejoinder ] and noticed a statement near the end of section 6 about paradigm shifts coming in different magnitudes over different time spans.  That reminded me of the almost-mystical ideas surrounding 1/f (f being frequency”) noise in some areas — the notion that almost everything exhibits that effect, and that effect extends to arbitrarily low f.  (I sense the idea only gets mystical when f gets low enough so that the event that may happen stochastically is really big—say, you model the height of waves in the Atlantic as 1/f and discover that, at some low frequency, Bermuda becomes submerged.  In other words, does the same mechanism that accounts for physical vibrations in the range of Hertz also account for the creation and destruction of islands that may occur in the range of reciprocal centuries?)

 This  report claims that eating meat increases the risk of cancer.  I’m sure you can’t read the page but you probably can understand the graphs. Different bars represent subdivision in the amount of the particular type of meat one consumes. And each chunk is different types of meat. Left is for male right is for female.


They claim that the difference is significant, but they are clearly not!!


I’m for not eating much meat but this is just way too much…

I don’t know what to think.  If you look carefully you can find one or two statistically significant differences but overall the pattern doesn’t look so compelling.  I don’t know what the top and bottom rows are, though.  Overall, the pattern in the top row looks like it could represent a real trend, while the graphs on the bottom row look like noise.

<p>Introduction: I followed  this link  from Chris Blattman to  an article  by economist Roland Fryer, who writes:
  
I [Fryer] find no evidence that teacher incentives increase student performance, attendance, or graduation, nor do I find any evidence that the incentives change student or teacher behavior.
  
What struck me were not the findings (which, as Fryer notes in his article, are plausible enough) but the use of the word “I” rather than “we.”  A field experiment is a big deal, and I was surprised to read that Fryer did it all by himself!
 
Here’s the note of acknowledgments (on the first page of the article):

<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.

<p>Introduction: After  our discussion  of visual displays of regression uncertainty, I asked Solomon Hsiang and Lucas Leeman to send me their code.  Both of them replied.
 
Solomon wrote: 
  
  
The matlab and stata functions I wrote, as well as the script that replicates my figures, are all posted on  my website .


Also, I just added options to the main matlab function (vwregress.m) to make it display the spaghetti plot (similar to what Lucas did, but a simple bootstrap) and the shaded CI that you suggested (see figs below). They’re good suggestions.


   


   


Personally, I [Hsiang] like the shaded CI better, since I think that all the visual activity in the spaghetti plot is a little distracting and sometimes adds visual weight in places where I wouldn’t want it.  But the option is there in case people like it.
  
Solomon then followed up with:

A surgeon showed me the “report card” his hospital received about his surgical group. The figure below shows what the report card looks like. I am very curious to hear what you think about the “deciles of the odds ratio” approach to evaluate and rank hospitals used by the American College of Surgeons.


 
  
I replied:  I don’t know enough about the substantive context to say too much here.  But, speaking generally, I am skeptical of those very high values for some of those odds ratios.  I suspect that much of what is plotted in this graph is just noise.  But I respect the goals underlying the plot, and I like that it displays a lot of information efficiently.

<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.

<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

<p>Introduction: Justin Kinney writes:
  
Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

<p>Introduction: Avi sent along  this old paper  from Bryk and Raudenbush, who write:
  
The presence of heterogeneity of variance across groups indicates that the standard statistical model for treatment effects no longer applies. Specifically, the assumption that treatments add a constant to each subject’s development fails. An alternative model is required to represent how treatment effects are distributed across individuals. We develop in this article a simple statistical model to demonstrate the link between heterogeneity of variance and random treatment effects. Next, we illustrate with results from two previously published studies how a failure to recognize the substantive importance of heterogeneity of variance obscured significant results present in these data. The article concludes with a review and synthesis of techniques for modeling variances. Although these methods have been well established in the statistical literature, they are not widely known by social and behavioral scientists.

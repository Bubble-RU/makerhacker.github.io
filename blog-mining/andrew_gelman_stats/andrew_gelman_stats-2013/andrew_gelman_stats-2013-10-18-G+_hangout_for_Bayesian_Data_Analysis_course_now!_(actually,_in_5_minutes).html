When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?

<p>Introduction: Tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30 (Paris time) I will be teaching my Bayesian Data Analysis  class  (class4a.pdf and class4b.pdf, you can follow the slides  here ).
 
We had  problems  earlier with the regular G+ hangout, so this time we’re trying the G+ On-Air Hangout which I think should work better.
 
I’ll post a blog entry tomorrow with a link to the hangout.  Let’s hope for the best!</p><p>3 0.29294866 <a title="2068-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-Just_gave_a_talk.html">2275 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-Just gave a talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>4 0.21032424 <a title="2068-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

<p>Introduction: Eoin Lawless wrote me:
  
I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.


My question: you are obviously evangelical about the benefits that Bayesian statistics brings, have you ever considered producing a Coursera (or similar) cour</p><p>6 0.19532758 <a title="2068-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-16-Test_run_for_G%2B_hangout_for_my_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_class.html">2064 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-16-Test run for G+ hangout for my Bayesian Data Analysis class</a></p>

Just to try things out, I’ll do a mini-hangout tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30.  What I’ll do is set up the hangout, then post the url in a new blog post.  I’ll then talk for a few minutes.  You should be able to click the url into your browser and see me.

I wonder what was in the syllabus?  If anyone has a copy, feel free to send to me and I will post it here.
 
My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.
  
Talk about obedience to authority!  They’re studying in a program that offers nonexistent courses, but then they follow the department’s gag order.</p><p>6 0.7172873 <a title="2068-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-Fitting_discrete-data_regression_models_in_social_science.html">325 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-Fitting discrete-data regression models in social science</a></p>

(actually, in 5 minutes)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?  Thanks.</p><p>2 0.94781828 <a title="2068-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-10-Presenting_at_the_econ_seminar.html">1050 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-10-Presenting at the econ seminar</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Savage saw  this  and pointed me to  this  video.  I didn’t actually look at it, but given that it is labeled, “For new econ Ph.D.’s about to look for a job . . . what you might expect when you give your first talk presenting your research,” I can pretty much guess what it’ll look like.</p><p>3 0.93767053 <a title="2068-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.
  
Again, I don’t blame Beilock and Ramirez—they appear to have been as helpful as</p><p>4 0.93722922 <a title="2068-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-Just_gave_a_talk.html">2275 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-Just gave a talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>5 0.93317151 <a title="2068-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

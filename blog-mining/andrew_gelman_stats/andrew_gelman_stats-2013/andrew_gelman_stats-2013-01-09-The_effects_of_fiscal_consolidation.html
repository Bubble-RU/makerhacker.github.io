<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups.

<p>Introduction: Leslie McCall spoke in the sociology department here the other day to discuss changes in attitudes about income inequality as well as changes in attitudes about attitudes about income inequality.  (That is, she talked about what survey respondents say, and she talked about what scholars have said about what survey respondents say.)
 
On the plus side, the talk was interesting.  On the downside, I had to leave right at the start of the discussion so I didn’t have a chance to ask my questions.  So I’m placing them below.
 
I can’t find a copy of McCall’s slides so I’ll link to  this recent op-ed  she wrote on the topic of “Rising Wealth Inequality: Should We Care?”  Her title was “Americans Aren’t Naive,” and she wrote:
  
Understanding what Americans think about rising income inequality has been hampered by three problems.

<p>Introduction: Reihan Salam  discusses  a theory of Tyler Cowen regarding “threshold earners,” a sort of upscale version of a slacker.   Here’s Cowen :
  
A threshold earner is someone who seeks to earn a certain amount of money and no more. If wages go up, that person will respond by seeking less work or by working less hard or less often. That person simply wants to “get by” in terms of absolute earning power in order to experience other gains in the form of leisure.
  
Salam continues:
  
This clearly reflects the pattern of wage dispersion among my friends, particularly those who attended elite secondary schools and colleges and universities. I [Salam] know many “threshold earners,” including both high and low earners who could earn much more if they chose to make the necessary sacrifices. But they are satisficers.
  
OK, fine so far.  But then the claim is made that “threshold earning” behavior increases income inequality.  In Cowen’s words:

<p>Introduction: My sometime coauthor Aaron Edlin cowrote (with Ian Ayres)  an op-ed  recommending a clever approach to taxing the rich.
 
In their article they employ a charming bit of economics jargon, using the word “earn” to mean “how much money you make.”  They “propose an automatic extra tax on the income of the top 1 percent of earners.”  I assume their tax would apply to unearned income as well, but they (or their editor at the Times) are just so used to describing income as “earnings” that they just threw that in.  Funny.
 
Also, there’s a part of the article that doesn’t make sense to me. 
   
Ayres and Edlin first describe the level of inequality:
  
In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.
  
Then they lay out their solution:

Here in Italy an “hype” topic is the “staffetta tra generazioni”, handover between generations: since unemployment rate in young people is very high, someone in the government is thinking to encourage older people to anticipate their retirement to make more jobs available for youngs. 
I am not an economist and I don’t want to discuss the economic plausibility of such a possible measure. 
However, some economists deny its success simply on the basis of a correlation and regression analysis. You can see the charts used as “evidence” here: http://www.lavoce.info/per-una-vera-staffetta-generazionale/ and here: http://noisefromamerika.org/articolo/occupazione-ricambio-intergenerazionale.

is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?  I [Bergman] have a sample size of roughly 400 people, and several binary variables correlate strongly with the outcome of interest and would also define interesting subgroups for analysis.  The problem is, stratifying over all of these (five or six) variables leaves me with strata that have only 1 person in them.  I have done some background reading on whether there is a rule of thumb for the maximum number of variables to stratify.  There does not seem to be much agreement (some say there should be between N/50-N/100 strata, others say as few as possible).  In economics, the paper I looked to is here, which seems to summarize literature related to clinical trials.  In short, my question is: is it bad to have several strata with 1 person in them? Should I group these people in with another stratum?

<p>Introduction: Lane Kenworthy  writes :
 
  
 
The book is full of graphs that support the above claims.  One thing I like about Kenworthy’s approach is that he performs a separate analysis to examine each of his hypotheses.  A lot of social scientists seem to think that the ideal analysis will conclude with a big regression where each coefficient tells a story and you can address all your hypotheses by looking at which predictors and interactions have statistically significant coefficients.  Really, though, I think you need a separate analysis for each causal question (see chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer, follow  this link ).
 
Kenworthy’s overall recommendation is to increase transfer payments to low-income families and to increase overall government spending on social services, and to fund this through general tax increases.
 
What will it take for this to happen?  After a review of the evidence from economic trends and opinion polls, Kenworthy writes, “Americans are potentially recepti</p><p>5 0.70904243 <a title="1663-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-26-How_to_understand_coefficients_that_reverse_sign_when_you_start_controlling_for_things%3F.html">1870 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-26-How to understand coefficients that reverse sign when you start controlling for things?</a></p>

Just read  this  today and my unsophisticated statistical mind is confused.


“Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics.”


From my education about statistics, I remember to be suspicious about multiple regression coefficients that are in the opposite direction of the bivariate coefficients. What I am missing? I vaguely remember something about the suppression effect.
  
My reply:
 
There’s a long literature on this from many decades ago.  My general feeling about such situations is that, when the coefficient changes a lot after controlling for other variables, it is important to visualize this change, to understand what is the interaction among variables that is associated with the change in the coefficients.

<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>4 0.9330765 <a title="1663-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-%E2%80%9CRoughly_90%25_of_the_increase_in_._._.%E2%80%9D__Hey%2C_wait_a_minute%21.html">549 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-“Roughly 90% of the increase in . . .”  Hey, wait a minute!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  links  approvingly to the following  statement  by Michael Mandel:
  
Homeland Security accounts for roughly 90% of the increase in federal regulatory employment over the past ten years.
  
Roughly 90%, huh?  That sounds pretty impressive.  But wait a minute . . . what if total federal regulatory employment had increased a bit less.  Then Homeland Security could’ve accounted for 105% of the increase, or 500% of the increase, or whatever.  The point is the change in total employment is the sum of a bunch of pluses and minuses.  It happens that, if you don’t count Homeland Security, the total hasn’t changed much–I’m assuming Mandel’s numbers are correct here–and that could be interesting.
 
The “roughly 90%” figure is misleading because, when written as a percent of the total increase, it’s natural to quickly envision it as a percentage that is bounded by 100%. There is a total increase in regulatory employment that the individual agencies sum to, but some margins are p</p><p>5 0.93244016 <a title="1663-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-05-Taking_philosophical_arguments_literally.html">17 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-05-Taking philosophical arguments literally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>6 0.92229092 <a title="1663-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-30-The_spam_just_gets_weirder_and_weirder.html">1698 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-30-The spam just gets weirder and weirder</a></p>

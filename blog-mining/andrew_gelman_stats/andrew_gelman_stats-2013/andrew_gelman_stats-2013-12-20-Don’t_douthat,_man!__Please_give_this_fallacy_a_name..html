It’s been a good month on that front.  In addition to the Garden of Forking Paths, I’ve encountered two entirely new (to me) fallacies.
 
The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!

</p><p>5 And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys. [sent-12, score-1.086]

</p><p>15 Well, because previous research on this question had suggested the reverse, with parents of daughters leaning left and parents of sons rightward. [sent-31, score-1.344]
</p><p>16 And those earlier findings dovetailed neatly with liberal talking points about politics and gender: Republicans make war on women, Democrats protect them, so it’s only natural that raising girls would make parents see the wisdom of liberalism …   But the new study undercuts those talking points.

<p>Introduction: We recently considered a pair of studies that came out awhile ago involving children and political orientation: Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely to support left-wing parties, compared to parents of boys. And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys.
 
As I  discussed  the other day, the latest version of the Conley and Raucher study came with some incoherent evolutionary theorizing.  There was also some discussion regarding the differences between the two studies.
 
Oswald sent me some relevant comments:
  
It will be hard in cross-sections like the GSS to solve the problem of endogeneity bias. Conservative families may want to have boys, and may use that as a stopping rule.  If so, they will end up with disproportionately large number of girls.

1.  A month or so ago we  reported  on an op-ed by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who was discussing recent research exemplified by the headline, “Study: Having daughters makes parents more likely to be Republican.”  Douthat wrote all about different effects of having girls, without realizing that the study was comparing parents of girls to parents of boys.  He just as well could have talked about the effects of having sons, and how that is associated with voting for Democrats (according to the study).  But he did not do so; he was implicitly considering boy children to be the default.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

<p>Introduction: We recently considered a pair of studies that came out awhile ago involving children and political orientation: Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely to support left-wing parties, compared to parents of boys. And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys.
 
As I  discussed  the other day, the latest version of the Conley and Raucher study came with some incoherent evolutionary theorizing.  There was also some discussion regarding the differences between the two studies.
 
Oswald sent me some relevant comments:
  
It will be hard in cross-sections like the GSS to solve the problem of endogeneity bias. Conservative families may want to have boys, and may use that as a stopping rule.  If so, they will end up with disproportionately large number of girls.

<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: Regular readers of this blog will know that I’m always on the lookout for new items for the  lexicon .  It’s been a good month on that front.  In addition to the Garden of Forking Paths, I’ve encountered two entirely new (to me) fallacies.
 
The first of the two new fallacies has a name that’s quite a mouthful; I’ll hold off on telling you about it right now, as Eric Loken and I are currently finishing a paper on it.  Once the paper’s done, I’ll post it in the  usual place  (or  here , once it is scheduled to be published) and I’ll add it to the lexicon as well.
 
What I want to talk about today is a fallacy I noticed a couple days ago.  I can’t think of a good name for it.  And that’s where you, the readers, come in.
 
Please give this fallacy a name!

<p>Introduction: David Brooks  writes : 
  
  
There’s an atmosphere of grand fragility hanging over America’s colleges. The grandeur comes from the surging application rates, the international renown, the fancy new dining and athletic facilities. The fragility comes from the fact that colleges are charging more money, but it’s not clear how much actual benefit they are providing. . . .


This is an unstable situation. At some point, parents are going to decide that $160,000 is too high a price if all you get is an empty credential and a fancy car-window sticker.


One part of the solution is found in three little words: value-added assessments. Colleges have to test more to find out how they’re doing.
  
I agree with that last paragraph.  Eric Loken and I  said  as much in the context of statistics teaching, but the principle of measuring outcomes makes sense more generally.

5. Which of the following better describes changes in public opinion on most issues? (Choose only one.)


(a) Dynamic stability: On any given issue, average opinion remains stable but liberals and conservatives move back and forth in opposite directions (the “accordion model”)


(b) Uniform swing: Average opinion on an issue can move but the liberals and conservatives don’t move much relative to each other (the disribution of opinions is a “solid block of wood”)


(c) Compensating tradeoffs: When considering multiple survey questions on the same general topic, average opinion can move sharply to the left or right on individual questions while the average over all the questions remains st</p><p>4 0.93188518 <a title="2141-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-17-Ripley_on_model_selection%2C_and_some_links_on_exploratory_model_analysis.html">1066 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-17-Ripley on model selection, and some links on exploratory model analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  is really fun.  I love how Ripley thinks, with just about every concept considered in broad generality while being connected to real-data examples.  He’s a great statistical storyteller as well.
 
 . . . and Wickham on exploratory model analysis 
 
I came across Ripley’s slides in a reference from Hadley Wickham’s  article on exploratory model analysis .  I’ve been interested for awhile in statistical graphics for understanding fitted models (which is different than the usual use of graphics to visualize data or to understand discrepancies of data from models).  Recently I’ve started using the term “exploratory model analysis,” and it seemed like such a natural phrase that I thought I’d google it and see what’s up.  I found the above-linked paper by Hadley, which in turn refers to  a paper  by Antony Unwin, Chris Volinksy, and Sylvia Winkler that defines “exploratory modelling analysis” as “the evaluation and comparison of many models simultaneously.”  That’s not exactly what I h</p><p>5 0.93112147 <a title="2141-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-14-Why_girls_do_better_in_school.html">1803 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-14-Why girls do better in school</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls.

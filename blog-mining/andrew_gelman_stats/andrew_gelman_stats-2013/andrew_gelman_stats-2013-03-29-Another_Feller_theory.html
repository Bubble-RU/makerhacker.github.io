Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood.

<p>Introduction: Updated version  of my paper with Xian:
  
The missionary zeal of many Bayesians of old has been matched, in the other direction, by an attitude among some theoreticians that Bayesian methods are absurd—not merely misguided but obviously wrong in principle. We consider several examples, beginning with Feller’s classic text on probability theory and continuing with more recent cases such as the perceived Bayesian nature of the so-called doomsday argument. We analyze in this note the intellectual background behind various misconceptions about Bayesian statistics, without aiming at a complete historical coverage of the reasons for this dismissal.

<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>6 0.14145248 <a title="1781-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-09-Coming_to_agreement_on_philosophy_of_statistics.html">1205 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-09-Coming to agreement on philosophy of statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
Eric Archer forwarded  this document  by Nick Freemantle, “The Reverend Bayes—was he really a prophet?”, in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine:

 

Does [Bayes's] contribution merit the enthusiasms of his followers? Or is his legacy overhyped? . . .


First, Bayesians appear to have an absolute right to disapprove of any conventional approach in statistics without offering a workable alternative—for example, a colleague recently stated at a meeting that ‘. . . it is OK to have multiple comparisons because Bayesians’ don’t believe in alpha spending’. . . .


Second, Bayesians appear to build an army of straw men—everything it seems is different and better from a Bayesian perspective, although many of the concepts seem remarkably familiar. For example, a very well known Bayesian statistician recently surprised the audience with his discovery of the P value as a useful Bayesian statistic at a meeting in Birmingham.


Third, Bayesians possess enormous enthusiasm fo</p><p>5 0.84165138 <a title="1781-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-28-Why_during_the_1950-1960%E2%80%B2s_did_Jerry_Cornfield_become_a_Bayesian%3F.html">2000 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-28-Why during the 1950-1960′s did Jerry Cornfield become a Bayesian?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joel Greenhouse writes:
  
I saw your recent paper on Feller [see  here  and, for a more fanciful theory,  here ].  Looks like it was fun to write.  I recently wrote  a paper  that asks an orthogonal question to yours.  Why during the 1950-1960′s did Jerry Cornfield become a Bayesian?   It appeared in Statistics in Medicine –  “On becoming a Bayesian: Early correspondences between J. Cornfield and L. J. Savage.”
  
In his paper, Greenhouse writes:
  
Jerome Cornfield was arguably the leading proponent for the use of Bayesian methods in biostatistics during the 1960s. Prior to 1963, however, Cornfield had no publications in the area of Bayesian statistics. At a time when frequentist methods were the dominant influence on statistical practice, Cornfield went against the mainstream and embraced Bayes. . . .

<p>Introduction: Paging Uri Simonsohn . . .
 
January 2014:  Alice Robb  writes , completely uncritically: “If Your Name is Dennis, You’re More Likely to Become a Dentist The strange science of how names shape careers.”
 
But look what you can learn from a quick google:
 
 
 
Hmmmm, maybe worth following up on that second link . . . 
 
More details  here , from 2011:
  
Devah Pager points me to  this article  by Uri Simonsohn, which begins:

 
Three articles published [by Brett Pelham et al.] have shown that a disproportionate share of people choose spouses, places to live, and occupations with names similar to their own. These findings, interpreted as evidence of implicit egotism, are included in most modern social psychology textbooks and many university courses. The current article successfully replicates the original findings but shows that they are most likely caused by a combination of cohort, geographic, and ethnic confounds as well as reverse causality.

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  links  to Steve Hsu  linking  to a 1977  interview  by Katherine Sopka of physics professor Sidney Coleman.
 
I don’t know anything about Coleman’s research but the interview caught my eye because one of my roommates in grad school was one of Coleman’s advisees.
 
Anyway, here’s the key bit from the interview:
  
Sopka:  But you do enjoy working with students or do you?


Coleman:  No. I hate it. You do it as part of the job. Well, that’s of course false…or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. Occasionally there’s a student who is a joy to work with. But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students…


Sopka:  I guess your remark means then that you would like to avoid teaching undergraduate courses or even required graduate courses…


Coleman:  Or even special topics courses. Teaching is unpleasant work. No question about it. It has its rewards. One feels happy about having a job well done.

<p>Introduction: James Druckman and Jeremy Freese write: 
  
  
We are pleased to announce that Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was renewed for another round of funding by NSF starting last Fall. TESS allows researchers to submit proposals for experiments to be conducted on a nationally-representative, probability-based Internet platform, and successful proposals are fielded at no cost to investigators.  More information about how TESS works and how to submit proposals is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org.


Additionally, we are pleased to announce the development of two new proposal mechanisms. TESS’s Short Studies Program (SSP) is accepting proposals for fielding very brief population-based survey experiments on a general population of at least 2000 adults. SSP recruits participants from within the U.S. using the same Internet-based platform as other TESS studies. More information about SSP and proposal requirements is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org/ssp.</p><p>5 0.93709004 <a title="1781-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-24-Erving_Goffman_archives.html">365 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-24-Erving Goffman archives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brayden King  points  to  this page  of materials on sociologist Erving Goffman.  Whenever I’ve read about Goffman, it always seems to be in conjunction with some story about his bad behavior–in that respect, King’s link above does not disappoint.  In the absence of any context, it all seems mysterious to me  Once or twice I’ve tried to read passages in books by Goffman but have never manage to get through any of it.  (This is not mean as any kind of criticism, it’s just a statement of my lack of knowledge.)  I was amused enough by the stories reported by King that I clicked through to the Biographical Materials section of the Goffman page and read a few.  I still couldn’t really quite get the point, though, perhaps in part because I only know one of the many people on that list.</p><p>6 0.92464197 <a title="1781-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-18-What_visualization_is_best%3F.html">40 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-18-What visualization is best?</a></p>

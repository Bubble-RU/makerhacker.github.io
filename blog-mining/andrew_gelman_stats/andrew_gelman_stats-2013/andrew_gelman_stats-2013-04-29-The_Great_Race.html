Last summer my wife and I took a 3.5-month vacation that included a wide range of activities. When I got back, people would ask “what were the highlights or your trip?”, and I was somewhat at a loss: we had done so many things that were so different, many of which seemed really great…how could I pick? Someone said, wisely, that in six months or a year I’d be able to answer the question because some memories would be more vivid than others. They were right, and I was recently thinking back on our vacation and putting together a list of highlights — enjoyable in itself, but also worth doing to help plan future vacations.
 
One of the things we did was go to four evenings of track and field events at the London Olympics. After we got back, people would ask what we had seen at the Olympics. I would say “We saw Usain Bolt run the 200m, we saw the women’s 4x100m relay and the men’s 4×400, we saw the last events of the decathlon…lots of great stuff.

</p><p>6 ”   Trying to figure out why that was one of my favorite events to watch, I looked up some  facts and statistics  about the race. [sent-12, score-0.333]
</p><p>7 It has even less of a following than most track events, which is saying something: I’m going to guess that most readers of this blog cannot name a single U. [sent-15, score-0.241]
</p><p>8 track athlete, and that only a tiny fraction can name a competitor in that 800m Olympics final. [sent-17, score-0.241]
</p><p>9 Like most people in the stadium, I expect, I was looking forward to the highly-anticipated 200m final later in the evening and hadn’t even thought about the 800. [sent-19, score-0.138]
</p><p>10 That 200m final was exciting and electrifying, but to me it was no match for the 800. [sent-20, score-0.209]
</p><p>11 When the race started…it’s hard to say how this could possibly be, but I could just tell that something special was happening. [sent-21, score-0.379]
</p><p>12 One of the runners — David Rudisha of Kenya, the record-holder at the time — went to the front and was pushing hard, and everyone else was going hard too. [sent-23, score-0.281]
</p><p>13 Well, yes, but… it’s hard to explain…it just seemed more intense even than the other finals we had seen, which seems paradoxical because, this being the 800m, the runners weren’t running as fast. [sent-28, score-0.504]
</p><p>14 I’ve tried to tell if you can see in  the video  what I’m talking about (the race starts at about 3:15), but I’m not really sure, you tell me. [sent-29, score-0.336]
</p><p>15 (One thing that you can see on the video is how easily these guys seem to cruise through the 400m mark in under 50 seconds, incredible). [sent-30, score-0.149]
</p><p>16 That column on the scoreboard looked like this:WR, NR, PB, PB, PB, NR, SB, PB  In other words, seven out of the eight runners had run their personal best time. [sent-33, score-0.649]
</p><p>17 It obviously takes a special effort to set a personal record, and those records usually come when the athlete has something at stake: the chance to finish on the podium at their national championships, or to qualify for the Olympic team, or whatever. [sent-35, score-0.818]
</p><p>18 For a guy who is rounding the final curve 20 meters behind the leaders, a guy who is going to finish in 8th place, to push himself to the fastest that he has ever run, that seems to me to be even more remarkable than someone running a personal best in order to set a new world record. [sent-36, score-0.752]
</p><p>19 I think what made this special was the effort all up and down the line, every runner trying his hardest right to the end. [sent-39, score-0.351]
</p><p>20 Maybe the best 800m races to watch are the ones where the last-place finishers run their hardest, not where the first-place finishers run theirs. [sent-40, score-0.702]

<p>Introduction: Jake Hofman writes that he saw my recent newspaper  article  on running (“How fast do we slow down? . . . For each doubling of distance, the world record time is multiplied by about 2.15. . . . for sprints of 200 meters to 1,000 meters, a doubling of distance corresponds to an increase of a factor of 2.3 in world record running times; for longer distances from 1,000 meters to the marathon, a doubling of distance increases the time by a factor of 2.1. . . . similar patterns for men and women, and for swimming as well as running”) and writes:

<p>Introduction: Every time I hear  this  sort of story:
  
Morrone—listed at 48 years old, which would have made her the oldest Olympic cross-country skier of all time by seven years—didn’t even show up for the 10K women’s classic on Feb. 13, claiming injury. (She was the only one of the race’s 76 entrants who didn’t start.) A day later, in the 15K men’s classic, di Silvestri, 47, made it out of the starting gate but gave up just a few hundred meters later, claiming illness. He was reportedly the only starter who failed to make even the first checkpoint.
  
I think about my cousin  Bill .
 
At least when Bill skied in the winter olympics a bunch of years ago as part of the Puerto Rican team, he finished.  OK, he finished last, but  somebody  had to finish last.  At least he skied down the whole damn slope.
 
P.S.  I have no idea how Puerto Rico was allowed to have an olympic team.  As you might have heard, it’s not actually a country.
 
P.P.S.  My cousin is not Puerto Rican.  But I think he’s gone the</p><p>4 0.10418376 <a title="1831-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-24-Bell_Labs.html">970 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-24-Bell Labs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>5 0.10308264 <a title="1831-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-28-Turing_chess_run_update.html">1473 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-28-Turing chess run update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In honor of the  Olympics , I got my butt over to the park and played run-around-the-house chess for the first time ever.
 
As was discussed in the comments thread  awhile ago , there seem to be three possible ways to play Turing chess:
 
1.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return.  Once you sit down to the table, the other player runs around the house.  Then you have to move, etc.  You lose if you are checkmated or if you fail to move before your opponent returns to his chair.
 
2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.
 
3.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player takes as long as he wants and makes his move, then he runs.  When you return, yo</p><p>6 0.09939231 <a title="1831-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-17-In_the_best_alternative_histories%2C_the_real_world_is_what%E2%80%99s_ultimately_real.html">2251 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-17-In the best alternative histories, the real world is what’s ultimately real</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ooooooh, I never ever thought I’d have a legitimate excuse to tell this story, and now I do!  The story took place many years ago, but first I have to tell you what made me think of it:
 
Rasmus Bååth  posted  the following comment last month:
  
On airplane tickets a Swedish “å” is written as “aa” resulting in Rasmus Baaaath. Once I bought a ticket online and five minutes later a guy from Lufthansa calls me and asks if I misspelled my name…
  
OK, now here’s my story (which is not nearly as good).  A long time ago (but when I was already an adult), I was in England for some reason, and I thought I’d take a day trip from London to Bath.  So here I am on line, trying to think of what to say at the ticket counter.  I remember that in England, they call Bath, Bahth.  So, should I ask for “a ticket to Bahth”?  I’m not sure, I’m afraid that it will sound silly, like I’m trying to fake an English accent.  So, when I get to the front of the line, I say, hesitantly, “I’d like a ticket to Bath?</p><p>4 0.85494548 <a title="1831-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-22-Tenants_and_landlords.html">158 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-22-Tenants and landlords</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.

There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.

<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>6 0.8291955 <a title="1831-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-18-What%E2%80%99s_my_Kasparov_number%3F.html">2105 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-18-What’s my Kasparov number?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Antonio Ramos writes:
  
The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.
  
My reply:
 
There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.  Beyond that, I think there is good work in psychometrics on covaraince structures but I donâ&euro;&trade;t know the literature.</p><p>2 0.9571957 <a title="1831-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-An_Olympic_size_swimming_pool_full_of_lithium_water.html">179 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-An Olympic size swimming pool full of lithium water</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: I opened the newspaper today (recall that this blog is on an approximately one-month delay) to see a moderately horrifying  story  about art appraisers who are deterred by fear of lawsuits from expressing an opinion about possible forgeries.
 
Maybe this trend will come to science too?  Perhaps Brett Pelham will sue Uri Simonsohn for the pain, suffering, and loss of income occurring from the  questioning of his Dennis the dentist paper ?  Or maybe I’ll be sued by some rogue sociologist for publicly questioning his data dredging?
 
Anyway, what amused me about the NYT article on art forgery was that two of the artists featured in the discussion were . . . Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein!  Warhol is famous for diluting the notion of the unique art object and for making works of art in a “Factory,” and Lichtenstein is famous for ripping off the style and imagery of comic book artists.  It’s funny for the two of them, of all people, to come up in a discussion of authenticity.

I’m probably not the first to point this out, but just in case, you might be interested in this   article  by T. Florian Jaeger, Daniel Pontillo, and Peter Graff on a statistical dispute [regarding the claim, "Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa"].


Seems directly relevant to your article on multiple hypothesis testing and associated talk at the Voodoo correlations meeting.  Curious to know your thoughts on this if you think it’s blog-worthy.
  
Here’s the abstract of the paper:
  
Atkinson (Reports, 15 April 2011, p. 346) argues that the phonological complexity of languages reflects the loss of phonemic distinctions due to successive founder events during human migration (the serial founder hypothesis). Statistical simulations show that the type I error rate of Atkinson’s analysis is hugely inflated. The data at best support only a weak interpretation of the serial founder hypothesis.

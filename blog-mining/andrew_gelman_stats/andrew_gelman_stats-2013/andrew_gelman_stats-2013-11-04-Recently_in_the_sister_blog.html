John Sides is the leader of the Monkey Cage and in particular was the key person involved in the Washington Post move.


But I will give you some general comments based on my own experiences.


I started blogging in 2004:  Samantha Cook (my postdoc at the time) and I set up the blog so that we could communicate our partially-formed research ideas to each other, in a way that would be open to the world so that (a) we could get input from interested outsiders, and (b) we could publicize our work.  We decided to post daily (or approximately thus).  At the time, I figured that if there was ever a time that we ran out of material, I could post summaries of my old research papers.


The blog quickly became a place for us to give our various thoughts on statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science.</p><p>3 0.30032599 <a title="2088-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-20-Bugs_Bunny%2C_the_governor_of_Massachusetts%2C_the_Dow_36%2C000_guy%2C_presidential_qualifications%2C_and_Peggy_Noonan.html">1129 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-20-Bugs Bunny, the governor of Massachusetts, the Dow 36,000 guy, presidential qualifications, and Peggy Noonan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Somebody points me to  this  horrifying exposé by Paul Raeburn on a new series by the Washington Post where they reprint press releases as if they are actual news.  And the gimmick is, the reason why it’s appearing on this blog, is that these are  university press releases  on  science stories .  What could possibly go wrong there?
 
After all, Steve Chaplin, a self-identified “science-writing PIO from an R1,” writes in a comment to Raeburn’s post:
  
We write about peer-reviewed research accepted for publication or published by the world’s leading scientific journals after that research has been determined to be legitimate.  Repeatability of new research is a publication requisite. 
  
I emphasized that last sentence myself because it was such a stunner.  Do people really think that???
 
So I guess what he’s saying is, they don’t do press releases for articles from  Psychological Science  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .  But I wonder how the profs in the psych d</p><p>5 0.1349951 <a title="2088-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-03-A_comment_on_a_post_at_the_Monkey_Cage.html">2048 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-03-A comment on a post at the Monkey Cage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The sister blog has  moved  to the Washington Post.  It’s harder to leave comments there, so I’ll post my comments to Monkey Cage posts here instead.
 
Political scientist Lisa Martin wrote  a post  on student evaluations of teaching, based on  a recent paper  where she writes:
  
Many female faculty believe that they face prejudice in student evaluations of teaching (SETs), and that this prejudice may be exaggerated by developments such as online evaluations and the prevalence of sites such as RateMyProfessor. However, systematic studies of SETs are mixed in their findings of gender bias.
  
As a statistician, I always like to hear this sort of moderate statement.  On the blog, Martin shows the following graph based on data from the political science departments of “publicly available SET data from two large public universities, one in the South and the other on the West Coast”:
 
 
 
The graph left me with two questions and a comment:

<p>Introduction: I’m trying to temporarily kick the blogging habit as I seem to be addicted.  I’m currently on a binge and my plan is to schedule a bunch of already-written entries at one per weekday and not blog anything new for awhile.
 
Yesterday I fell off the wagon and posted 4 items, but maybe now I can show some restraint.
 
P.S.  In keeping with the spirit of this blog, I scheduled it to appear on 13 May, even though I wrote it on 15 Apr.  Just about everything you’ve been reading on this blog for the past several weeks (and lots of forthcoming items) were written a month ago.  The only exceptions are whatever my cobloggers have been posting and various items that were timely enough that I inserted them in the queue afterward.
 
P.P.S  I bumped it up to 22 Jun because, as of 14 Apr, I was continuing to write new entries.  I hope to slow down soon!
 
P.P.P.S. (20 June) I was going to bump it up again–the horizon’s now in mid-July–but I thought, enough is enough!
 
Right now I think that about ha</p><p>3 0.74979144 <a title="2088-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Our_new_improved_blog%21__Thanks_to_Cord_Blomquist.html">856 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Our new improved blog!  Thanks to Cord Blomquist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all.  You may have noticed changes in the appearance of the blog.   Cord Blomquist  moved us over to this new WordPress blog.  He earlier did it for our sister blog and he can do it for you too, for a reasonable fee.  We had a few hitches in getting all the files and links and comments working, and Cord was with us all the way to straighten things out.  Thanks, Cord!  You did a great job and we’re happy to recommend you to others.
 
P.S.  The last thing we got working was the RSS feed.  So if you’ve been reading the blog on RSS, you have about 3 weeks of backlog you can catch up on.
 
P.P.S.  We’re still playing a bit with the blog’s formatting.  Feel free to put any formatting suggestions in the comments.</p><p>4 0.74642301 <a title="2088-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-01-Non-topical_blogging.html">1964 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-01-Non-topical blogging</a></p>

Every once in awhile I [Thoma] kind of need a bit of a break . . . I ran out of energy a few weeks ago . . .

What I do is post once a day; when I write new posts, I schedule them for the future.  I currently have approx 2-month lag.  Sometimes I post 2 or 3 times in one day, if I have something topical or just something I feel like posting on.  Overall, though, I find a benefit to the lag.

I have mixed feelings about the move of the Monkey Cage blog to the Washington Post.  I’ve been told we get many more readers, but the the comments have declined in number and in quality.  It used to be that posting at the Monkey Cage felt like “blogging”:  I’d post something there and look at the comments.  It was a political science community with many participants from outside the field.  Posting at the new blog is more like writing for the newspaper:  it’s a broadcast without real feedback.  This all makes me realize how much I appreciate the commenters here.  Just as I blog for free, out</p><p>2 0.90901041 <a title="2088-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-04-Patterns.html">556 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-04-Patterns</a></p>

I [Gries] am not sure if what you are  suggesting  by “doing data analysis in a patternless way” is a pitch for deductive over inductive approaches as a solution to the problem of reporting and publication bias. If so, I may somewhat disagree. A constant quest to prove or disprove theory in a deductive manner is one of the primary causes of both reporting and publication bias. I’m actually becoming a proponent of a remarkably non-existent species – “applied political science” – because there is so much animosity in our discipline to inductive empirical statistical work that seeks to answer real world empirical questions rather than contribute to parsimonious theory building. Anyone want to start a JAPS – Journal of Applied Political Science? Our discipline is in danger of irrelevance.

<p>Introduction: Emanuel Derman  and  Paul Wilmott  wonder how to get their fellow modelers to give up their fantasy of perfection. In a  Business Week article  they proposed, not entirely in jest, a model makers’ Hippocratic Oath:
  
 I will remember that I didn’t make the world and that it doesn’t satisfy my equations. 
 Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics. 
 I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so. Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights. 
 I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.

<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

<p>Introduction: Tomas Iesmantas writes:
  
I’m facing a problem where parameter space is bounded, e.g. all parameters have to be positive. If in MCMC as proposal distribution I use normal distribution, then at some iterations I get negative proposals. So my question is: should I use recalculation of acceptance probability every time I reject the proposal (something like in delayed rejection method), or I have to use another proposal (like lognormal, truncated normal, etc.)?
  
The simplest solution is to just calculate p(theta)=0 for theta outside the legal region, thus reject those jumps.  This will work fine (just remember that when you reject, you have to stay at the last value for one more iteration), but if you’re doing these rejections all the time, you might want to reparameterize your space, for example using logs for positive parameters, logits for constrained parameters, and softmax for parameters that are constrained to sum to 1.</p><p>6 0.89059234 <a title="2088-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-29-The_difficulties_of_measuring_just_about_anything.html">2043 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-29-The difficulties of measuring just about anything</a></p>

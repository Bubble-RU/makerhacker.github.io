<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:
 
1.  Not enough bridge projects, huh?  I don’t believe it.  We’ve been hearing fo</p><p>3 0.31095812 <a title="1936-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-26-One_fun_thing_about_physicists_._._..html">431 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-26-One fun thing about physicists . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: . . . they’re  not  in awe of economists.
 
In contrast, economists sometimes treat each other with the soft bigotry of low expectations.  For example, here’s Brad DeLong in defense of Larry Summers:
  
[During a 2005 meeting, Summers] said that in a modern economy with sophisticated financial markets we were likely to have more and bigger financial crises than we had before, just as the worst modern transportation accidents are worse than the worst transportation accidents back in horse-and-buggy days. . . . Indeed, for twenty years one of Larry’s conversation openers has been: “You really should write something else good on positive-feedback trading and its dangers for financial markets.”
  
That’s fine, but, hey, I’ve been going around saying this for many years too, and I’m not even an economist (although I did get an A in the last econ class I took, which was in eleventh grade).   Lots and lots of people  have been talking for years about the dangers of positive feedback, the risk</p><p>4 0.27934733 <a title="1936-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Domain_specificity%3A__Does_being_really_really_smart_or_really_really_rich_qualify_you_to_make_economic_policy%3F.html">45 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Domain specificity:  Does being really really smart or really really rich qualify you to make economic policy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s this idea called “domain specificity” that I learned from my sister many years ago:  it’s the idea that a skill might work in some domains but not others. For example, knowing (some) Spanish helps a bit with my French but it doesn’t do anything for my Chinese.  Traditionally in psychometrics, this sort of thing is studied using correlation–scores on various math tests are highly correlated with each other, and these are also correlated (but less so) with scores on English tests.  Michael Jordan would probably be good at just about any sport he tried (even if he couldn’t quite hit the curveball).  Top actors can typically sing, dance, do magic, etc.–they’re great all-around performers.  And so on.
 
I was reminded of domain specificity after reading a  blog  by Felix Salmon arguing that Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers made big mistakes when they served as Treasury Secretaries during the Clinton administration.  Salmon writes:

<p>Introduction: Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute reports:
  
Goldman Sachs’ latest forecast (and they’ve been pretty accurate so far) is that unemployment will rise to 9.9% by early 2011 and trend down to 9.7% for the last quarter of 2011. Obviously, this is a simply awful scenario but it seems one that is being accepted. That is, we seem to be in the process of accepting the unacceptable. Note that this scenario probably assumes the passage of the limited efforts now being considered in Congress.
  
One might be surprised that Obama and congressional Democrats are not doing more to try to bring unemployment down.  On the other hand, just to speak in generalities (not knowing any of the people involved), I would think that Obama would be much much more worried about the economy doing well in 2010 and then crashing in 2012.  A crappy economy through 2011 and then improvement in 2012–that would be his ideal, no?  Not that he would have the ability to time this sort of thing.

<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>4 0.75311351 <a title="1936-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-20-No_no_no_no_no.html">1020 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-20-No no no no no</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.  The disturbing thing about the whole process wasn’t so much that the Tea Partiers were irrational as that th</p><p>5 0.72940207 <a title="1936-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-04-Recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">1705 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-04-Recently in the sister blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>2 0.92852992 <a title="1936-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics%3A__What_went_wrong%3F.html">1060 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics:  What went wrong?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser and I tell  the story .  Regular readers will be familiar with  much  of this material.
 
We kept our article short because of space restrictions at American Scientist magazine.  Now I want to do a follow-up with all the good stories that we had to cut.
 
P.S.  Let me remind everyone once again that Freakonomics (the book and the blog) has some great stuff.  Kaiser and I are only picking on Levitt & co. because we know they could do so much better.
 
P.P.S.  Just to emphasize:  our point that Freakonomics has mistakes is nothing new—see, for example, the articles and blogs by Felix Salmon, Ariel Rubenstein, John DiNardo, and Daniel Davies.  The contribution of our new article is explore how it was that all these mistakes happened, to juxtapose the many strengths of the Freakonomics franchise (much of the work described in the first book but also a lot of what appears on their blog) with its failings.  In some ways these contrasts are characteristic of social science research in</p><p>3 0.92641413 <a title="1936-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-30-That_puzzle-solving_feeling.html">492 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-30-That puzzle-solving feeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>4 0.92470813 <a title="1936-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-15-1-2_social_scientist_%2B_1-2_politician_%3D_%3F%3F%3F.html">713 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-15-1-2 social scientist + 1-2 politician = ???</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:
 
1.  Not enough bridge projects, huh?  I don’t believe it.  We’ve been hearing fo</p><p>5 0.92425483 <a title="1936-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Science%2C_ideology%2C_and_human_origins.html">483 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Science, ideology, and human origins</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  link  from Tyler Cowen led me to this  long blog article  by Razib Khan, discussing some recent genetic findings on human origins in the context of the past twenty-five years of research and popularization of science.
  

 
I don’t know much about human origins (beyond my ooh-that’s-cool reactions to exhibits at the Natural History Museum, my general statistician’s skepticism at various over-the-top claims I’ve heard over the years about “mitochondrial Eve” and the like, and various bits I’ve read over the years regarding when people came over to Australia, America, etc.), but what particularly interested me about Khan’s article was his discussion about the various controversies among scientists, his own reactions when reading and thinking about these issues as they were happening (Khan was a student at the time), and the interaction between science and political ideology.
 
There’s a limit to how far you can go with this sort of cultural criticism of science, and Khan realizes this</p><p>6 0.92095518 <a title="1936-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>

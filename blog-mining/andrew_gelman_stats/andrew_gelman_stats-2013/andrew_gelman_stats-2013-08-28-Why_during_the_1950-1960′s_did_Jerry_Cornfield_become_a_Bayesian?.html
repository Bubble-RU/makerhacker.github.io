<p>Introduction: My article with Cosma Shalizi has appeared in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.  I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.
 
 Here’s the issue of the journal , which also includes an introduction, several discussions, and a rejoinder:

<p>Introduction: My paper with Christian Robert,  “Not Only Defended But Also Applied”: The Perceived Absurdity of Bayesian Inference , was recently published in The American Statistician, along with discussions by Steve Fienberg, Steve Stigler, Deborah Mayo, and Wesley Johnson, and our rejoinder,  The Anti-Bayesian Moment and Its Passing .
 
These articles revolved around the question of why the great probabilist William Feller, in his classic book on probability (“Feller, Volume 1,” as it is known), was so intemperately anti-Bayesian.  We located Feller’s attitude within a post-WW2 “anti-Bayesian moment” in which Bayesian inference was perceived as a threat to the dominance of non-Bayesian methods, which were mature enough to have solved problems yet new enough to still appear to have limitless promise.

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

I am an econ doctoral student, trying to do some empirical work using Bayesian methods.  Recently I read a paper(and its discussion) that pitches Bayesian methods against GMM (Generalized Method of Moments), which is quite popular in econometrics for frequentists. I am wondering if you can, here or on your blog, give some insights about these two methods, from the perspective of a Bayesian statistician. I know GMM does not conform to likelihood principle, but Bayesian are often charged with strong distribution assumptions.  
  
I can’t actually help on this, since I don’t know what GMM is.  My guess is that, like other methods that don’t explicitly use prior estimation, this method will work well if sufficient information is included as data.  Which would imply a hierarchical structure.</p><p>3 0.90120113 <a title="2000-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-12-%E2%80%9CNot_only_defended_but_also_applied%E2%80%9D%3A_The_perceived_absurdity_of_Bayesian_inference.html">1262 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-12-“Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Updated version  of my paper with Xian:
  
The missionary zeal of many Bayesians of old has been matched, in the other direction, by an attitude among some theoreticians that Bayesian methods are absurd—not merely misguided but obviously wrong in principle. We consider several examples, beginning with Feller’s classic text on probability theory and continuing with more recent cases such as the perceived Bayesian nature of the so-called doomsday argument. We analyze in this note the intellectual background behind various misconceptions about Bayesian statistics, without aiming at a complete historical coverage of the reasons for this dismissal.

<p>Introduction: Charlie Williams writes:
  
As I get interested in Bayesian approaches to statistics, I have one question I wondered if you would find interesting to address at some point on the blog.


What does Bayesian work look like in action across a field? From experience, I have some feeling for how ongoing debates evolve (or not) with subsequent studies in response to earlier findings. I wonder if you know how this happens in practice when multiple researchers are using Bayesian approaches. How much are previous findings built into priors? How much advance comes from model improvement? And in a social science field where self-selection and self-interest play a role, how are improved “treatment” effects incorporated and evaluated?


I thought you might know of a field where actual back and forth has been carried out mostly in the context of Bayesian analysis or inference, and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at an example as I think about my own field.

<p>Introduction: Alexander at GiveWell  writes :
  
The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>2 0.96923035 <a title="2000-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-R_sucks.html">1919 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-R sucks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was trying to make some new graphs using 5-year-old R code and I got all these problems because I was reading in files with variable names such as “co.fipsid” and now R is automatically changing them to “co_fipsid”.  Or maybe the names had underbars all along, and the old R had changed them into dots.  Whatever.  I understand that backward compatibility can be hard to maintain, but this is just annoying.</p><p>3 0.96917933 <a title="2000-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-Going_negative.html">1918 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-Going negative</a></p>

I have measured total phosphorus, TP, on a number of dialysis patients, and also measured conventional phosphate, Pi. Now P is exchanged with the environment as Pi, so in principle a correlation between TP and Pi could perhaps be expected. I’m really most interested in the fraction of TP which is not Pi, that is TP-Pi. I would also expect that to be positively correlated with Pi. However, looking at the data using a mixed model an insignificant negative correlation is obtained. Then I thought, that since TP-Pi is bound to be small if Pi is large a negative correlation is almost dictated by the math even if the biology would have it otherwise in so far as the the TP-Pi, likely organic P, must someday have been Pi. Hence I thought about correcting the slight negative correlation between TP-Pi and Pi for the expected large negative correlation due to the math – to eventually recover what I came from: a positive correlation. People seems to agree that this thinki</p><p>4 0.96558863 <a title="2000-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-The_consulting_biz.html">1618 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-The consulting biz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Kaiser writes  thoughtfully  about the costs, benefits, and incentives for different policy recommendation options regarding a recent water crisis.  Good stuff:  it’s solid “freakonomics”–and I mean this in positive way:  a mix of economic and statistical analysis, with assumptions stated clearly.  Kaiser writes: 
  
Using the framework from Chapter 4, we should think about the incentives facing the Mass. Water Resources Authority:


A false positive error (people asked to throw out water when water is clean) means people stop drinking tap water temporarily, perhaps switching to bottled water, and the officials claim victory when no one falls sick, and businesses that produce bottled water experience a jump in sales. It is also very difficult to prove a “false positive” when people have stopped drinking the water. So this type of error is easy to hide behind.


A false negative error (people told it’s safe to drink water when water is polluted) becomes apparent when someone falls sick</p><p>6 0.95952559 <a title="2000-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-13-Can_you_write_a_program_to_determine_the_causal_order%3F.html">1801 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-13-Can you write a program to determine the causal order?</a></p>

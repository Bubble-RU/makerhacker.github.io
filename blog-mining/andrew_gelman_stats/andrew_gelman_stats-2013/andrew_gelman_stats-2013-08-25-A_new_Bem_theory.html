<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>3 0.31302384 <a title="1998-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-With_a_bit_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_again_on_this_topic%2C_and_with_a_lot_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_today.html">576 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-With a bit of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post again on this topic, and with a lot of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post today</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Masse points me to  this response  by Daryl Bem and two statisticians (Jessica Utts and Wesley Johnson) to criticisms by Wagenmakers et.al. of Bem’s recent ESP study.  I have nothing to add but would like to repeat a couple bits of my discussions of last month, of  here :
  
Classical statistical methods that work reasonably well when studying moderate or large effects (see the work of Fisher, Snedecor, Cochran, etc.) fall apart in the presence of small effects.


I think it’s naive when people implicitly assume that the study’s claims are correct, or the study’s statistical methods are weak. Generally, the smaller the effects you’re studying, the better the statistics you need. ESP is a field of small effects and so ESP researchers use high-quality statistics.


To put it another way: whatever methodological errors happen to be in the paper in question, probably occur in lots of researcher papers in “legitimate” psychology research. The difference is that when you’re studying a</p><p>4 0.30569017 <a title="1998-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-How_should_journals_handle_replication_studies%3F.html">762 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-How should journals handle replication studies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  reports :
  
Recently  Ben Goldacre wrote  about a group of researchers (Stuart Ritchie, Chris French, and Richard Wiseman) whose null replication of 3 experiments from the infamous Bem ESP paper was rejected by JPSP – the same journal that published Bem’s paper.
  
Srivastava recognizes that JPSP does not usually publish replications but this is a different story because it’s an anti-replication.
 
Here’s the paradox:
 
- From a scientific point of view, the Ritchie et al. results are boring.  To find out that there’s no evidence for ESP . . . that adds essentially zero to our scientific understanding.  What next, a paper demonstrating that pigeons can fly higher than chickens?  Maybe an article in the Journal of the Materials Research Society demonstrating that diamonds can scratch marble but not the reverse??
 
- But from a science-communication perspective, the null replication is a big deal because it adds credence to  my hypothesis  that the earlier ESP claims</p><p>5 0.20422363 <a title="1998-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.

<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone points me to  this  news article by Christopher Shea on the challenges of debunking ESP.  Shea  writes :
  
Earlier this year, a major psychology journal published a paper suggesting that there was some evidence for “pre-cognition,” a form of ESP. Stuart Ritchie, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh, is part of a team that tried, but failed, to replicate those results. Here, he tells the Chronicle of Higher Education’s Tom Bartlett about the difficulties he’s had getting the results published.


Several journals told the team they wouldn’t publish a study that did no more than disprove a previous study. . . . An editor at another journal said he’d “only accept our paper if we ran a fourth experiment where we got a believer [in ESP] to run all the participants, to control for . . . experimenter effects.”

<p>Introduction: The other day I was talking with someone who knows Daryl Bem a bit, and he was sharing his thoughts on that  notorious  ESP paper that was published in a leading journal in the field but then was mocked, shot down, and was repeatedly replicated with no success.  My friend said that overall the Bem paper had positive effects in forcing psychologists to think more carefully about what sorts of research results should or should not be published in top journals, the role of replications, and other things.
 
I expressed agreement and shared my thought that, at some level, I don’t think Bem himself fully believes his ESP effects are real.  Why do I say this?  Because he seemed oddly content to publish results that were not quite conclusive.  He ran a bunch of experiments, looked at the data, and computed some post-hoc p-values in the .01 to .05 range.  If he really were confident that the phenomenon was real (that is, that the results would apply to new data), then he could’ve easily run the</p><p>2 0.96396506 <a title="1998-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-08-More_on_those_dudes_who_will_pay_your_professor_%248000_to_assign_a_book_to_your_class%2C_and_related_stories_about_small-time_sleazoids.html">329 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-08-More on those dudes who will pay your professor $8000 to assign a book to your class, and related stories about small-time sleazoids</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.

I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>5 0.95808423 <a title="1998-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-21-Interpreting_interactions_in_discrete-data_regression.html">1908 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-21-Interpreting interactions in discrete-data regression</a></p>

Are you familiar with the work of Ai and Norton on interactions in logit/probit models? I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.


Ai, C.R. and Norton E.C. 2003. Interaction terms in logit and probit models. Economics Letters 80(1): 123-129.


A peer ref just cited this paper in reaction to a logistic model we tested and claimed that the “only” way to test an interaction in logit/probit regression is to use the cross derivative method of Ai & Norton. I’ve never heard of this issue or method. It leaves me wondering what the interaction term actually tests (something Ai & Norton don’t discuss) and why such an important discovery is not more widely known. Is this an issue that is of particular relevance to econometric analysis because they approach interactions from the difference-in-difference perspective?

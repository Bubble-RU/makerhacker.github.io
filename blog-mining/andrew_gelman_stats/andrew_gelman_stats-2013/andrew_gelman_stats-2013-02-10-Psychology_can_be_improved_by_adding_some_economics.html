<p>Introduction: The title of this blog post quotes the second line of the abstract of Goldstein et al.’s much ballyhooed 2008 tech report,  Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?  Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings .  
 
The first sentence of the abstract is
  

Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.

  
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the easy target wine snobs make, the popular press has picked up on the first sentence of the tech report.  For example, the  Freakonomics blog/radio entry  of the same name quotes the first line, ignores the qualification, then concludes
  

Wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons, and urging you to spend $15 instead of $50 on your next bottle of wine. Go ahead, take the money you save and blow it on the lottery.

  
In case you’re wondering about whether to buy me a cheap or expensive bottle of wine, keep in mind I’ve had classical “wine training”.

<p>Introduction: In an ideal world, research articles would be open to criticism and discussion in the same place where they are published, in a sort of non-corrupt version of Yelp.  What is happening now is that the occasional paper or research area gets lots of press coverage, and this inspires reactions on science-focused blogs.  The trouble here is that it’s easier to give off-the-cuff comments than detailed criticisms.
 
Here’s an example.  It starts a couple years ago with  this article  by Ryota Kanai, Tom Feilden, Colin Firth, and Geraint Rees, on brain size and political orientation:
  
In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants.

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture. And when we look at world-wide revenues, this film brought in more than $1.5 billion. . . . Despite what seems like a clear endorsement by the customers of this industry, the Avengers was ignored by the Oscars.  Perhaps this is just because I am an econo</p><p>5 0.08350458 <a title="1717-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-16-Annals_of_really_really_stupid_spam.html">577 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-16-Annals of really really stupid spam</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon  writes :
  
Economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson  have a problem  with Grant Achatz’s pricing strategy at Next, where tickets are sold at a fixed price and are then free to be resold at an enormous markup on the secondary market . . .

 
“It’s democratic in theory, but not in practice,” said Wolfers . . .


If a person can sell a ticket for $3,000, the true cost of going to the restaurant — what an economist would call the opportunity cost — is $3000, because that’s how much money the person is giving up for the meal.
 

Bloomberg’s Mark Whitehouse concludes that Next should “consider selling tickets to the highest bidder and giving the extra money to charity” . . .
  
What strikes me is how weird this discussion is.  Why should this restaurant owner have some sort of moral obligation to maximize his income and then donate to charity?  For one thing, if he really did make more money off the deal he might just keep it.  But more to the point, this sort of maximiz</p><p>3 0.8437289 <a title="1717-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-09-Experimental_work_on_market-based_or_non-market-based_incentives.html">1410 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-09-Experimental work on market-based or non-market-based incentives</a></p>

I found  a discussion  at the Boston Review that I thought you’d be interested in, given your posts on the potentially dubious foundations of many neoclassical economics models.


Michael Sandel cites a few examples of markets crowding out moral behavior.  His longest discussion regards Frey and Oberholzer-Gee’s work demonstrating Swiss citizens’ willingness to admit a nuclear waste facility to town  decreasing  when offered monetary incentives.  It seems like this is a situation that really demands a discussion of the available empirical evidence (Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini have two papers, “Pay Enough or Don’t Pay At All” and “A Fine is a Price” that seem especially relevant.)


While the essay has sparked the usual sort of libertarian response, I’m struck by the fact that most people aren’t talking about the experimental work that’s actually available—it seems like this is the best way forward.

<p>Introduction: The following is an essay into a topic I know next to nothing about.
 
As part of our endless discussion of Dilbert and Charlie Sheen, commenter Fraac  linked  to a blog by philosopher Edouard Machery, who tells a  fascinating story :
  
How do we think about the intentional nature of actions? And how do people with an impaired mindreading capacity think about it?


Consider the following probes: 


The Free-Cup Case

 
Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, ‘I don’t care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.’ Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a commemorative cup.

<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there.  As I  wrote  a couple years ago, it’s usually presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
For example, Nassim Taleb has a  webpage  that includes a bunch of one-line bits of advice (scroll to item 132 on the linked page).  Here’s his final piece of advice:
  
If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.
  
I’m a big Taleb fan (search this blog to see), but this seems like classic negative-sum advice.  I can see how it can be a good  individual  strategy to keep your mouth shut, bide your time, and then sandbag your enemies.  But it can’t be good if lots of people are doing this.  Verbal attacks are great, as long as there’s a chance to respond.  I’ve been in environments where people follow Taleb’s advice, saying nothing and occasionally trying to “eliminate” people, and it’s not pretty.  I much prefer for people to be open</p><p>6 0.82852399 <a title="1717-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-04-The_acupuncture_paradox.html">889 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-04-The acupuncture paradox</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On this blog I’ve occasionally written about the problems that arise when economists act as amateur psychologists.  But the problem can go the other way, too.  For example, consider  this blog  by Berit Brogaard and Kristian Marlow ( link  from Abbas Raza).  Brogaard and Marlow give several amusing stories about ripoffs (a restaurant that scams customers into buying expensive bottles of wine, a hairdresser that sucks customers into unnecessary treatments, a ghostwriter who takes thousands of dollars in payments and doesn’t do the job, etc.).  Then they ask, “How did it happen? Why did you act in this impulsive way? Why didn’t you learn your lesson the first time around? Do you have some kind of brain damage?”
 
They continue with some discussion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula, etc etc etc., and then conclude with the following advice:
  
Is there anything we can do to avoid these moments of crazy decision-making? Yes but only by intentionally turning on our</p><p>2 0.91338897 <a title="1717-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-Giving_credit_where_due.html">1830 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-Giving credit where due</a></p>

I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

Join the Roosevelt Institute on December 2nd, from 8-11am at NYC’s Harvard Club 27 West 44th St. for a panel discussion of the Bipartisan Deficit Commission Report, the future of the U.S. Economy, and the prospects for policy change in the wake of the midterm elections.


The conversation will be framed by the release of three new Roosevelt Institute White Papers: 


Democracy in Peril: The American Turnout Problem and the Path to Plutocracy (Walter Dean Burnham)


A World Upside Down: Deficit Fantasies in the Great Recession (Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson)


Principles and Guidelines For Deficit Reduction (Joseph Stiglitz)

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

I’ve seen some Bayes related things recently that might make for interesting fodder on your blog.


There are two books, teaching Bayesian analysis from a programming perspective.


And also a “web application for data analysis using powerful Bayesian statistical methods.”
  
   
I took a look.  The first book is  Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics Made Simple, by Allen B. Downey .  It’s super readable and, amazingly, has approximately zero overlap with Bayesian Data Analysis.  Downey discusses lots of little problems in a conversational way.  In some ways it’s like an old-style math stat textbook (although with a programming rather than mathematical flavor) in that the examples are designed for simplicity rather than realism.  I like it!  Our book already exists; it’s good to have something else for people to read, coming from an entirely different perspective.

I am sure you must be aware of the recent controversy ignited by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Cholesterol Treatment Guidelines that were released last month. They have been the subject of several  newspaper articles  and  blogs , most of them missing the thrust of the guidelines. There is much to admire about these guidelines as they are more faithfully aligned with high-quality ‘actionable’ evidence than the 3 previous iterations. However, the controversy is focused on the performance of the risk calculator introduced for initiating treatment in individuals without established atherosclerotic disease or diabetes (so-called primary prevention cohort). The guidelines recommend statins for primary prevention in individuals who have a 10-year risk estimated to be 7.5%. The risk calculator was derived from population cohorts studied in the 1990s.

<p>Introduction: The other day I posted  some comments  on the voting patterns of rich and poor in the context of Charles Murray’s recent book, “Coming Apart.”  My graphs on income and voting are just fine, but I mischaracterized Murray’s statements.  So I want to fix that right away.  After that I have some thoughts on the book itself.
 
In brief:
 
1. I was unfair to call him a Tucker Carlson.
 
2. Murray talks a lot about upper-class liberals. That’s fine but I think his discussion would be improved by also considering upper-class conservatives, given that I see the big culture war occurring within the upper class.
 
3. Using the case of Joe Paterno as an example, I discuss why Murray’s “preach what you practice” advice could be difficult to carry out in practice. 
   
 Murray on the top 5% 
 
David Frum  quoted  Murray as writing that the top 5% “tends to be liberal—right? There’s no getting around it. Every way of answering this question produces a yes.”  In response, Frum and I both pointed out t</p><p>6 0.12622038 <a title="1912-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-02-Culture_clash.html">1836 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-02-Culture clash</a></p>

Is there any literature on the Bayesian approach to simultaneous equation systems that you could suggest? (Think demand/supply in econ).
  
My reply:  Iâ&euro;&trade;m not up-to-date on the Bayesian econometrics literature.  TTony Lancaster came out with a book a few years ago that might have some of these models.  Maybe you, the commenters, have some suggestions?

I [Bell] just finished “The Emperor of All Maladies” from 2010. One of the sections is captioned with the “In God we trust, all others bring data” quote which is supposedly from Deming. If you haven’t read it, I think you might like it even though the topic is pretty morbid (i.e. cancer).


I was rereading chapter 7 in Bayesian Data Analysis. While the principles there would allow me to “roll my own”, I was wondering whether or not there is now a comprehensive “cookbook” out there that gathers together such analyses for a variety of experimental designs – sort of a Bayesian equivalent to Montgomery’s “Design and Analysis of Experiments”.
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know, but now I’m thinking we should put some of this in our forthcoming book, Statistics for Psychology Research.

The book with Hill has very little on longitudinal models. So do you recommended any reference to complement your book on covariance structures typical from these models, such as AR(1), Antedependence, Factor Analytic, etc? I am very much interest in BUGS code for these basic models as well as how to extend them to more complex situations.

There is a book by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand on Bayesian space-time models.

<p>Introduction: Scott Berry, Brad Carlin, Jack Lee, and Peter Muller recently came out with  a book  with the above title.
 
The book packs a lot into its 280 pages and is fun to read as well (even if they do use the word “modalities” in their first paragraph, and later on they use the phrase “DIC criterion,” which upsets my tidy, logical mind).  The book starts off fast on page 1 and never lets go.
 
Clinical trials are a big part of statistics and it’s cool to see the topic taken seriously and being treated rigorously.  (Here I’m not talking about empty mathematical rigor (or, should I say, “rigor”), so-called optimal designs and all that, but rather the rigor of applied statistics, mapping models to reality.)
 
Also I have a few technical suggestions.
 
1.  The authors fit a lot of models in Bugs, which is fine, but they go overboard on the WinBUGS thing.  There’s WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS:  they’re all Bugs recommend running Bugs from R using the clunky BRugs interface rather than the smoother bugs(</p><p>6 0.69977844 <a title="1912-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-Bayes_in_China_update.html">517 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-Bayes in China update</a></p>

I saw  this post and response  from about 5 years ago, regarding a fellow analyzing levels of white blood cells.


He was asking about Bayesian approaches to quality control and couldn’t find a canonical resource on that topic. Five years on and I similarly don’t see many good resources on the topic, though it seems like a useful application of Bayesian analysis. Just wondering if you have any further thoughts on the matter now after a few years.


In my searching, I did find  this interesting book  on Bayesian Reliability.  It’s not quality control, of course, but it does seem that failure prediction and risk analysis have some bearing on quality control and process control. And the cited reviews are very positive. It was written by some researchers at Los Alamos.


Also an edited  book  on process control:  I saw that Bill Bolstad gives it a positive review in one of the journals. And a  book  on Bayesian risk analysis.</p><p>2 0.96596229 <a title="1912-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-25-Fascinating_graphs_from_facebook_data.html">1824 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-25-Fascinating graphs from facebook data</a></p>

People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized.

<p>Introduction: The Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology at the Steinhardt School of Education has  two job openings !  One is for an assistant/associated tenure track position for an applied statistician or psychometrician.  The other is for a postdoc in causal inference and sensitivity analysis.
 
Jennifer Hill and Marc Scott at the Steinhardt school are just great!  Weâ&euro;&trade;re working together on various research projects so if you manage to get one of these jobs maybe you can collaborate with us here at Columbia too.  So I have every interest in encouraging the very best people to apply for these jobs.</p><p>4 0.96434224 <a title="1912-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-31-Somewhat_Bayesian_multilevel_modeling.html">246 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-31-Somewhat Bayesian multilevel modeling</a></p>

I’m trying to generate county-level estimates from a statewide survey of California using multilevel modeling.  I would love to learn the full Bayesian approach, but I’m on a tight schedule and worried about teaching myself something of that complexity in the time available.


I’m hoping I can use the classical approach and simulate standard errors using what you and Jennifer Hill call the “informal Bayesian” method.  This has raised a few questions:


First, what are the costs of using this approach as opposed to full Bayesian?


Second, when I use the predictive simulation as described on p. 149 of “Data Analysis” on a binary dependent variable and a sample of 2000, I get a 5%-95% range of simulation results so large as to be effectively useless (on the order of +/- 15 points).  This is true even for LA county, which has enough cases by itself (about 500) to get a standard error of about 2 points from simple disaggregation.  However, if I simulate only with t</p><p>5 0.960572 <a title="1912-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-08-Discussion_with_Steven_Pinker_on_research_that_is_attached_to_data_that_are_so_noisy_as_to_be_essentially_uninformative.html">2326 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-08-Discussion with Steven Pinker on research that is attached to data that are so noisy as to be essentially uninformative</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I pointed Steven Pinker to my post,  How much time (if any) should we spend criticizing research that’s fraudulent, crappy, or just plain pointless? , and he responded:
  
Clearly it *is* important to call out publicized research whose conclusions are likely to be false. The only danger is that it’s so easy and fun to criticize, with all the perks of intellectual and moral superiority for so little cost, that there is a moral hazard to go overboard and become a professional slasher and snarker. (That’s a common phenomenon among literary critics, especially in the UK.) There’s also the risk of altering the incentive structure for innovative research, so that researchers stick to the safest kinds of paradigm-twiddling. I think these two considerations were what my late colleague Dan Wegner had in mind when he made the bumbler-pointer contrast — he himself was certainly a discerning critic of social science research.

<p>Introduction: Sociologist Fabio Rojas  reports  on “a conversation I [Rojas] have had a few times with statisticians”:
  
Rojas:  “What does your research tell us about a sample of, say, a few hundred cases?”


Statistician: “That’s not important. My result works as n–> 00.”


Rojas: “Sure, that’s a fine mathematical result, but I have to estimate the model with, like, totally finite data. I need inference, not limits. Maybe the estimate doesn’t work out so well for small n.”


Statistician: “Sure, but if you have a few million cases, it’ll work in the limit.”


Rojas: “Whoa. Have you ever collected, like, real world network data? A million cases is hard to get.”
  
The conversation continues in this frustrating vein.  Rojas writes:
  
This illustrates a fundamental issue in statistics (and other sciences). One you formalize a model and work mathematically, you are tempted to focus on what is mathematically interesting instead of the underlying problem motivating the science. . . .

<p>Introduction: “Explanation” is this thing that social scientists (or people in their everyday lives, acting like social scientists) do, where some event X happens and we supply a coherent story that concludes with X.  Sometimes we speak of an event as “overdetermined,” when we can think of many plausible stories that all lead to X.
 
My question today is:  what is explanation, in a statistical sense?
 
To understand why this is a question worth asking at all, compare to prediction.  Prediction is another thing that we all to, typically in a qualitative fashion:  I think she’s gonna win this struggle, I think he’s probably gonna look for a new job, etc.  It’s pretty clear how to map everyday prediction into a statistical framework, and we can think of informal qualitative predictions as approximations to the predictions that could be made by a statistical model (as in the  classic work  of Meehl and others on clinical vs. statistical prediction).

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.

A couple of months ago, you were visiting the University of Groningen, and after the talk you gave there I spoke briefly with you about a study that I conducted with Richard Morey, Jeff Rouder and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers. In the study, we found that researchers’  knowledge of how to interpret a confidence interval (CI), was almost as limited as the knowledge of students who had had no inferential statistics course yet. Our manuscript was recently accepted for publication in  Psychonomic Bulletin & Review , and it’s now available online (see e.g.,  here ). Maybe it’s interesting to discuss on your blog, especially since CIs are often promoted (for example in the new guidelines of Psychological Science ), but apparently researchers seem to have little idea how to interpret them.

As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.

Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reacted  (see further discussion in comments  here ) to a recent study on early childhood intervention, in which researchers Paul Gertler, James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Arianna Zanolini, Christel Vermeerch, Susan Walker, Susan M. Chang, and Sally Grantham-McGregor estimated that a particular intervention on young children had raised incomes on young adults by 42%.  I wrote:
  
Major decisions on education policy can turn on the statistical interpretation of small, idiosyncratic data sets — in this case, a study of 129 Jamaican children. . . . Overall, I have no reason to doubt the direction of the effect, namely, that psychosocial stimulation should be good. But I’m skeptical of the claim that income differed by 42%, due to the reason of  the statistical significance filter . In section 2.3, the authors are doing lots of hypothesizing based on some comparisons being statistically significant and others being non-significant.

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas  writes :
  
After reading the  Fowler/Christakis paper on networks and obesity , a student asked why it was that friends had a stronger influence on spouses. In other words, if we believe the F&C; paper, they report that your friends (57%) are more likely to transmit obesity than your spouse (37%) (see page 370).


This might be interpreted in two ways. First, it might be seen as a counter argument. This might really indicate that homophily is at work. We probably select spouses for some traits that are not self-similar. While we choose friends mainly on self-similarity of leisure and consumption (e.g, diet and exercise). Second, there might be an explanation based on transmission. We choose friends because we want them to influence us, while spouses are (supposed?) to accept us.


Your thoughts?
  
My thought:  No.  No no no no no.  No no no.  No.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago Larry Bartels  presented  this graph, a version of which latter appeared in his book Unequal Democracy:
 
 
 
Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy. This is consistent with Democrats’ general policies of lowering unemployment, as compared to Republicans lowering inflation, and, by comparing first-term to second-term presidents, he found that the result couldn’t simply be explained as a rebound or alternation pattern.
 
The question then arose, why have the Republicans won so many elections? Why aren’t the Democrats consistently dominating? Non-economic issues are part of the story, of course, but lots of evidence shows the economy to be a key concern for voters, so it’s still hard to see how, with a pattern such as shown above, the Republicans could keep winning.
 
Larry had some explanations, largely having to do with timing:  under De</p><p>4 0.95266503 <a title="2142-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-25-Classical_probability_does_not_apply_to_quantum_systems_%28causal_inference_edition%29.html">2037 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-25-Classical probability does not apply to quantum systems (causal inference edition)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: James Robins, Tyler VanderWeele, and Richard Gill  write :
  
Neyman introduced a formal mathematical theory of counterfactual causation that now has become standard language in many quantitative disciplines, but not in physics. We use results on causal interaction and interference between treatments (derived under the Neyman theory) to give a simple new proof of a well-known result in quantum physics, namely, Bellís inequality.


Now the predictions of quantum mechanics and the results of experiment both violate Bell’s inequality. In the remainder of the talk, we review the implications for a counterfactual theory of causation. Assuming with Einstein that faster than light (supraluminal) communication is not possible, one can view the Neyman theory of counterfactuals as falsified by experiment. . . .


Is it safe for a quantitative discipline to rely on a counterfactual approach to causation, when our best confirmed physical theory falsifies their existence?

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price. 
 
A reporter once told me that the worst-kept secret of journalism is that every story has errors.  And it’s true that just about every time I know about something first-hand, the news stories about it have some mistakes. Reporters aren’t subject-matter experts, they have limited time, and they generally can’t keep revisiting the things they are saying and checking them for accuracy.  Many of us have published papers with errors — my most recent paper has an incorrect figure — and that’s after working on them carefully for weeks!
 
One way that reporters can try to get things right is by quoting experts.  Even then, there are problems with taking quotes out of context, or with making poor choices about what material to include or exclude, or, of course, with making a poor selection of experts.

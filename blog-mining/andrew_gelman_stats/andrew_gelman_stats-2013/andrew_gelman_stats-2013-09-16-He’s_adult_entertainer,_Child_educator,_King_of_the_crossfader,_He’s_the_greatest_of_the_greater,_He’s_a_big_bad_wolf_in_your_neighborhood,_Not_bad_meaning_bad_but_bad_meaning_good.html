<p>Introduction: Just in case you didn’t check Retraction Watch yet  today , Carolyn Johnson reports:
  
The committee painstakingly reconstructed the process of data analysis and determined that Hauser had changed values, causing the result to be statistically significant, an important criterion showing that findings are probably not due to chance.
  
As the man  said :
  
His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
  
As a statistician, I don’t mind if someone is attacked because of cheating with data.
 
Johnson concludes her news article in a pleasantly balanced way:
  
The committee said it carefully considered Hauser’s allegation that people in his laboratory conspired against him, due to academic rivalry and disgruntlement, but did not find evidence to support the idea.


The committee also acknowledged that many of Hauser’s overall findings about the cognitive abilities of animals may stand. His results that showed that animals</p><p>3 0.11229147 <a title="2026-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious%3A_Why_We_Evolved_a_Taste_for_Being_Bad.html">1901 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>5 0.090182997 <a title="2026-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-02-A_useful_rule_of_thumb.html">175 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-02-A useful rule of thumb</a></p>

TEMPLETON BOOK FORUM invites you to “Is the Cyber Mob a Threat to Freedom?” featuring Ron Rosenbaum, Slate, Lee Siegel, The New York Observer, moderated by Michael Goodwin, The New York Post


New Threats to Freedom


Today’s threats to freedom are “much less visible and obvious than they were in the 20th century and may even appear in the guise of social and political progress,” writes Adam Bellow in his introduction to the new essay collection that he has edited for the Templeton Press. Indeed, Bellow suggests, the danger often lies precisely in our “failure or reluctance to notice them.”


According to Ron Rosenbaum and Lee Siegel, in their provocative contributions to the volume, the extraordinary advances made possible by the Internet have come at a sometimes worrisome cost. Rosenbaum focuses on how online anonymity has become a mask encouraging political discourse that is increasingly distorted by vitriol, abuse, and</p><p>3 0.75939 <a title="2026-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious%3A_Why_We_Evolved_a_Taste_for_Being_Bad.html">1901 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Daniel Mendelsohn recently  asked , “Why do we love the Titanic?”, seeking to understand how it has happened that: 
  
  
It may not be true that ‘the three most written-about subjects of all time are Jesus, the Civil War, and the Titanic,’ as one historian has put it, but it’s not much of an exaggeration. . . . The inexhaustible interest suggests that the Titanic’s story taps a vein much deeper than the morbid fascination that has attached to other disasters. The explosion of the Hindenburg, for instance, and even the torpedoing, just three years after the Titanic sank, of the Lusitania, another great liner whose passenger list boasted the rich and the famous, were calamities that shocked the world but have failed to generate an obsessive preoccupation. . . . 


If the Titanic has gripped our imagination so forcefully for the past century, it must be because of something bigger than any fact of social or political or cultural history.

<p>Introduction: The paradox of racism is that at any given moment, the racism of the day seems reasonable and very possibly true, but the racism of the past always seems so ridiculous. 
   
I’ve been thinking about this for a few months ever since receiving in the mail a new book, “A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human History,” by New York Times reporter Nicholas Wade.
 
Here’s what I wrote in my review of this book  for Slate :
  
The word “inequality” does not appear in the book’s index, but what Wade is offering is essentially a theory of economic and social inequality, explaining systematic racial differences in prosperity based on a combination of innate traits (“the disinclination to save in tribal societies is linked to a strong propensity for immediate consumption”) and genetic adaptation to political and social institutions (arguing, for example, that generations of centralized rule have effected a selection pressure for Chinese to be accepting of authority).

<p>Introduction: An offhand mention in  this  recent post motivated me to google Evilicious. And  this  is what I found:
 
 
 
From the prologue:
  
The idea I [Hauser] develop is that evildoers are made in much the same way that addicts are made. Both processes start with unsatisfied desires. Whether it is a taste for violence or a taste for alcohol, drugs, food, or gambling, individuals develop cravings but find the desired experience less and less rewarding, a separation between desire and reward that leads to excess. To justify the excess, the psychology of desire recruits the psychology of denial, enabling individuals to immerse themselves in a new reality that feels right.
  
Interesting. This could be an excellent book. I imagine that the author has a lot of insight into this psychological state of immersing oneself in a new reality that feels right. Or maybe we all do this. In any case, thinking about extreme evil (what Hauser calls “gratuitous cruelty”) is helpful in developing a sense of pers</p><p>2 0.92479777 <a title="2026-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>3 0.91471803 <a title="2026-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-03-Public_Opinion_on_Health_Care_Reform.html">15 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-03-Public Opinion on Health Care Reform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My article with Daniel and Yair  has recently appeared in The Forum:
  
We use multilevel modeling to estimate support for health-care reform by age, income, and state. Opposition to reform is concentrated among higher-income voters and those over 65. Attitudes do not vary much by state. Unfortunately, our poll data only go to 2004, but we suspect that much can be learned from the relative positions of different demographic groups and different states, despite swings in national opinion. We speculate on the political implications of these findings.
  
The article features some pretty graphs that originally appeared on the blog.
 
It’s in a special issue on health care politics that has several interesting articles, among which I’d like to single out  this one  by Bob Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs entitled, “Simulating Representation: Elite Mobilization and Political Power in Health Care Reform”:

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang  writes :
  
I [Hsiang] have posted about high temperature inducing individuals to exhibit more violent behavior when driving,  playing baseball and prowling bars.  These cases are neat anecdotes that let us see the “pure aggression” response in lab-like conditions. But they don’t affect most of us too much. But violent crime in the real world affects everyone. Earlier, I posted a paper by Jacob et al. that looked at assault in the USA for about a decade – they found that higher temperatures lead to more assault and that the rise in violent crimes rose more quickly than the analogous rise in non-violent property-crime, an indicator that there is a “pure aggression” component to the rise in violent crime.


A new working paper “Crime, Weather, and Climate Change” by recent Harvard grad Matthew Ranson puts together an impressive data set of all types of crime in USA counties for 50 years. The results tell the aggression story using street-level data very clearly  [click to</p><p>6 0.89454901 <a title="2026-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-05-The_statistics_software_signal.html">1655 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-05-The statistics software signal</a></p>

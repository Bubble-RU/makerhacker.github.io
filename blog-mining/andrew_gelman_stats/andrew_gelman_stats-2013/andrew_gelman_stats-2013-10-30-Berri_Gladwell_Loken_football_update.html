</p><p>11 In our research we did look at touchdowns per pass attempt. [sent-46, score-0.551]

But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri writes:
  
Saw  you had a post  on the research I did with Rob Simmons on the NFL draft.  I have attached the article.  This article has not officially been published, so please don’t post this on-line.


The post you linked to states the following:   “On his blog, Berri says he restricts the analysis to QBs who have played more than 500 downs, or for 5 years. He also looks at per-play statistics, like touchdowns per game, to counter what he considers an opportunity bias.”


Two points:  First of all, we did not look at touchdowns per game (that is not a per play stat).  More importantly —  as this post indicates  — we did far more than just look at data after five years. 


We did mention the five year result, but directly below that discussion (and I mean, directly below), the following sentences appear.

 
Our data set runs from 1970 to 2007 (adjustments were made for how performance changed over time).

<p>Introduction: The only thing is, I’m not sure who’s David here and who is Goliath.  From the standpoint of book sales, Gladwell is Goliath for sure.  On the other hand, Gladwell’s credibility has been weakened over the years by fights with bigshots such as Steven Pinker.  Maybe the best analogy is a boxing match where Gladwell stands in the ring and fighter after fighter is sent in to bang him up.  At some point the heavyweight gets a little bit tired. (Recently Gladwell had a New Yorker column defending dopers such as Lance Armstrong, so I suspect he’ll have Kaiser Fung  coming  after him  again , once the current lucha with Chabris is over.)
 
Chabris took his swing at Gladwell a few days ago, as I reported  here .
 
Yesterday was Gladwell’s  turn .  I have a lot of sympathy for the Blink-man here:  he writes these bestsellers and puts himself out there, so he’s a target.  If Gladwell’s books were generic business-bestseller pap of the be-yourself-and-be-tough variety, he wouldn’t get hassled.

<p>Introduction: Theodore Vasiloudis writes:
  
I’d like to bring your attention to  this article  by Benjamin Morris discussing the value of steals for the NBA. The author argues that a steal should be a highly sought after statistic as it equates to higher chances of victory and is very hard to replace when a player is injured.


I would argue that the reason behind the correlations showing this data is the fact that steals are much more rare in an NBA game than any of the other stats examined so their contribution is exaggerated.
  
I looked at Morris’s article and it looks like he’s running a regression of players’ plus-minus statistics on points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals and turnovers.  He writes, “A marginal steal is weighted nine times more heavily when predicting a player’s impact than a marginal point.  For example, a player who averages 16 points and two steals per game is predicted (assuming all else is equal) to have a similar impact on his team’s success as one who averages 25 poi</p><p>5 0.69232911 <a title="2082-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Bidding_for_the_kickoff.html">559 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Bidding for the kickoff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>6 0.68911207 <a title="2082-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-21-Scrabble%21.html">813 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-21-Scrabble!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”

<p>Introduction: Sports researcher Dave Berri had a disagreement with  a remark  in our recent discussion of Malcolm Gladwell.  Berri writes:
  
This post [from Gelman] contains the following paragraph:

 
Similarly, when Gladwell claimed that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college, he appears to have been wrong. But if you take his writing as stone soup, maybe it’s valuable: just retreat to the statement that there’s only a weak relationship between draft order and NFL performance. That alone is interesting. It’s too bad that Gladwell sometimes has to make false general statements in order to get our attention, but maybe that’s what is needed to shake people out of their mental complacency.
 

The above paragraph  links  to a blog post by Eric Loken.  This is something you have linked to before.  And when you linked to it before I tried to explain why Loken’s work is not very good.  Since you still think this work shows that Gladwell – and therefore Rob</p><p>3 0.9249804 <a title="2082-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-11-Toward_a_framework_for_automatic_model_building.html">1718 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-11-Toward a framework for automatic model building</a></p>

I saw your  recent blog post  where you discussed in passing an iterative-chain-of models approach to AI. 


I essentially built such a thing for  my PhD thesis  – not in a Bayesian context, but in a logic programming context – and proved it had a few properties and showed how you could solve some toy problems. The important bit of my framework was that at various points you also go and get more data in the process – in a statistical context this might be seen as building a little univariate model on a subset of the data, then iteratively extending into a better model with more data and more independent variables – a generalized forward stepwise regression if you like.  It wrapped a proper computational framework around E.M. Gold’s identification/learning in the limit based on a logic my advisor (Eric Martin) had invented.

<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.

There is a  report  by Martin Tingley and Peter Huybers in Nature on the unprecedented high temperatures at northern latitudes (Russia, Greenland, etc). What is more interesting is the authors are have used a straightforward hierarchical Bayes model, and for the first time (as far as I can remember) the results are reported with a probability attached to them (P>0.99), as opposed to the usual p-value<0.01 business. This might be a sign that editors of big time science journals are welcoming Bayesian approaches.
  
I agree.  This is a good sign for statistical communication.  Here are the key sentences from the abstract:
  
Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600 years.

<p>Introduction: From  my new article  in the journal Epidemiology:
  
Sander Greenland and Charles Poole accept that P values are here to stay but recognize that some of their most common interpretations have problems. The casual view of the P value as posterior probability of the truth of the null hypothesis is false and not even close to valid under any reasonable model, yet this misunderstanding persists even in high-stakes settings (as discussed, for example, by Greenland in 2011). The formal view of the P value as a probability conditional on the null is mathematically correct but typically irrelevant to research goals (hence, the popularity of alternative—if wrong—interpretations). A Bayesian interpretation based on a spike-and-slab model makes little sense in applied contexts in epidemiology, political science, and other fields in which true effects are typically nonzero and bounded (thus violating both the “spike” and the “slab” parts of the model).

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>3 0.66163135 <a title="1677-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-03-An_argument_that_can%E2%80%99t_possibly_make_sense.html">743 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-03-An argument that can’t possibly make sense</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
Texas has begun to enforce [a law regarding parallel parking] only recently . . . Up until now, of course, there has been strong net mobility into the state of Texas, so was the previous lack of enforcement so bad?
  
I care not at all about the direction in which people park their cars and I have no opinion on this law, but I have to raise an alarm at Cowen’s argument here.
 
Let me strip it down to its basic form:
 
1.  Until recently, state X had policy A.
 
2.  Up until now, there has been strong net mobility into state X
 
3.  Therefore, the presumption is that policy A is ok.
 
In this particular case, I think we can safely assume that parallel parking regulations have had close to zero impact on the population flows into and out of Texas.  More generally, I think logicians could poke some holes into the argument that 1 and 2 above imply 3.  For one thing, you could apply this argument to  any  policy in any state that’s had positive net migration.

There was a brief commentary from the Benetech folk on the Human Security Report Project’s, “The Shrinking Costs of War” report on  your blog  in January.


But the report has since generated a lot of  public controversy .  Since the report–like the  current discussion  in your blog on Mike Spagat’s new paper on Iraq–deals with controversies generated by survey-based excess death estimates,  we thought your readers might be interested.


Our responses to the debate were posted on  our website  last week.  “Shrinking Costs” had discussed the dramatic decline in death tolls from wartime violence since the end of World War II –and its causes. We also argued that deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition had declined. (The exec. summary is  here .)


One of the most striking findings was that mortality rates (we used under-five mortality data) decline during most wars.  Indeed our latest research indicates that of the total number of years that countries w</p><p>5 0.64922625 <a title="1677-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-The_Conservative_States_of_America.html">636 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-The Conservative States of America</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After noting the increasing political conservatism of people in the poorer states, Richard Florida  writes :
  
The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism’s hold on America’s states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal.


Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward.


But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political. This ideological state of affairs advantages the policy preferences of poorer, less innovative states over wealthier, more innovative, and productive ones. American politics is increasingly disconnected from its economic engine.  And this deepening political divide has become pe</p><p>6 0.6443063 <a title="1677-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-21-Belief_in_hell_is_associated_with_lower_crime_rates.html">1386 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-21-Belief in hell is associated with lower crime rates</a></p>

My brief feedback is that water is confounded with these results. They should have subtracted water content from the weight of all dietary items, as it inflates the proportion of milk, vegetable and fruit items that contain more water. They did that for soda (which is represented as sugar/corn syrup), amplifying the inconsistency.

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>4 0.89862466 <a title="1677-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-27-Who_is_that_masked_person%3A_The_use_of_face_masks_on_Mexico_City_public_transportation_during_the_Influenza_A_%28H1N1%29_outbreak.html">298 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-27-Who is that masked person: The use of face masks on Mexico City public transportation during the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tapen Sinha writes:
  
Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.
  
 The paper  appeared in the journal Health Policy.  From the abstract:

<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.

The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

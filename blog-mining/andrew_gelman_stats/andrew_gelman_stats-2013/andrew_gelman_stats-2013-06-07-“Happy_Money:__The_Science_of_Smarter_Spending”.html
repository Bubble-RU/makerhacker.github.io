</p><p>3 I have some mixed feelings about this goal (don’t people like me have enough happiness as it is? [sent-4, score-0.287]
</p><p>4 ) and I think that Dunn and Norton do too, in that, although they give occasional hints as to their affluent audience (referring, for example, to luxury cars, houses with swimming pools in exclusive suburbs, massages at the Four Seasons Hotel, and bullfight tickets (yuck! [sent-7, score-0.592]
</p><p>5 ) for a “dream vacation in Spain”), they don’t seem to offer any explicit discussion of who they are aiming their advice at. [sent-8, score-0.067]
</p><p>6 I certainly don’t think it’s wrong for Dunn and Norton to try to improve the happiness of America’s economic elite—after all, I teach at Harvard and Columbia! [sent-9, score-0.287]
</p><p>7 The book was sent to me, perhaps, because it overlaps with two of my research interests:  happiness studies, and the statistical interpretation of psychology research. [sent-12, score-0.463]
</p><p>8 Overall I found Dunn and Norton’s advice to be reasonable, and I appreciated their effort to link their recommendations to experimental data. [sent-15, score-0.14]
</p><p>9 For example, one of their general points is that one should “buy experiences rather than material goods,” but then to illustrate that point, they give an example of Harvard dorm rooms. [sent-17, score-0.59]
</p><p>10 Apparently, some dorms at that Ivy-leaved haven are much more desired than others, but retrospective evaluations found that the students who were randomly assigned to the more sought-after dorms were no happier, on average, than those assigned to the less-popular dorms. [sent-18, score-0.496]
</p><p>11 living in a dorm room for a year or two is an experience, not a material good! [sent-22, score-0.548]
</p><p>12 So this example seems to go against their argument. [sent-23, score-0.078]
</p><p>13 Here is one very salient experience that doesn’t matter as much as people think. [sent-24, score-0.068]
</p><p>14 To be fair, another one of the authors’ points is that everyday experiences (such as living in a nice dorm room) are less important than special experiences (like that bullfight—ugh, I don’t want to keep thinking about that one…). [sent-25, score-0.809]
</p><p>15 So the Harvard dorm story could work for them, it’s just in the wrong chapter. [sent-26, score-0.312]
</p><p>16 It was just funny to see an example right at the beginning of chapter 1 that contradicted the chapter’s message. [sent-27, score-0.212]
</p><p>17 There’s something about the book’s tone that seems off to me—they talk about everyday happiness and they talk about national policy, but they never seem to get around to the tough problems that can make people really sad. [sent-28, score-0.445]
</p><p>18 It seems odd for a book on happiness and spending not to discuss anything about how to spend money to alleviate depression:  should depressed people spend their money on drugs, on therapy, should they change their jobs, etc. [sent-29, score-1.049]
</p><p>19 There must be a lot of research by psychologists on this topic. [sent-31, score-0.089]
</p><p>20 My favorite parts are when the authors describe the experiments that they and their collaborators did to answer this or that question about everyday happiness. [sent-33, score-0.158]

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>3 0.1988295 <a title="1887-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-02-Helpful_on_happiness.html">1360 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-02-Helpful on happiness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following on our recent  discussion  of contradictory findings on happiness, David Austin writes:

<p>Introduction: Sharon Jayson  writes :
  
The conventional wisdom that’s developed over the past few decades — based on early research — has said parents are less happy, more depressed and have less-satisfying marriages than their childless counterparts.


But now, two new studies presented as part of the Population Association of America’s annual meeting suggest that earlier findings in several studies weren’t so clear-cut and may, in fact, be flawed. The newer analyses presented this week use analytical methods based on data from almost 130,000 adults around the globe — including more than 52,000 parents — and the conclusions aren’t so grim. They say that parents today may indeed be happier than non-parents and that parental happiness levels — while they do drop — don’t dip below the levels they were before having children. . . .


The other study, of some 120,000 adults from two nationally representative surveys between 1972-2008, finds that parents were indeed less happy than non-parents in the d</p><p>5 0.14865303 <a title="1887-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago I watched a bunch of Speed Racer cartoons with Phil in a movie theater in the early 90s. These were low-budget Japanese cartoons from the 60s that we loved as kids. From my adult perspective, the best parts were during the characters’ long drives, where you could see Japanese industrial scenes in the background.
 
Similarly, sometimes the most interesting aspect of a book or article is not its overt content but rather its unexamined assumptions.
 
I was reminded of this today when reading the Times this morning.  In an interesting column reviewing recent research on happiness (marred only by his decision not to interview any psychology researchers; after all, they’re the academic experts on the topic), Adam Davidson  writes :
  
So much debate about government policy is based on economic statistics that come out of the market. But the goal of government is not just to maximize revenue.
  
This perked me up.  Not  just  to maximize revenue?

<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups. In Europe, the poor and those on the left of the political spectru</p><p>6 0.76486212 <a title="1887-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-Advice_to_help_the_rich_get_richer.html">8 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-Advice to help the rich get richer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>2 0.971277 <a title="1887-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-Lists_of_Note_and_Letters_of_Note.html">1306 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-Lists of Note and Letters of Note</a></p>
<p>Introduction: These  (from Shaun Usher) are surprisingly good, especially since he appears to come up with new lists and letters pretty regularly.  I suppose a lot of them get sent in from readers, but still.
 
Here’s my favorite recent item, a  letter  sent to the Seattle Bureau of Prohibition in 1931:
  
Dear Sir:


My husband is in the habit of buying a quart of wiskey every other day from a Chinese bootlegger named Chin Waugh living at 317-16th near Alder street.


We need this money for household expenses. Will you please have his place raided? He keeps a supply planted in the garden and a smaller quantity under the back steps for quick delivery. If you make the raid at 9:30 any morning you will be sure to get the goods and Chin also as he leaves the house at 10 o’clock and may clean up before he goes.


Thanking you in advance, 


I remain 
yours truly,


Mrs. Hillyer</p><p>3 0.96506304 <a title="1887-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-21-If_a_lottery_is_encouraging_addictive_gambling%2C_don%E2%80%99t_expand_it%21.html">1731 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-21-If a lottery is encouraging addictive gambling, don’t expand it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: My article  with the above title is appearing in the journal Teaching Statistics.  Here’s the introduction:
  
We can improve our teaching of statistical examples from books by collecting further data, reading cited articles and performing further data analysis. This should not come as a surprise, but what might be new is the realization of how close to the surface these research opportunities are: even influential and celebrated books can have examples where more can be learned with a small amount of additional effort.


We discuss three examples that have arisen in our own teaching: an introductory textbook that motivated us to think more carefully about categorical and continuous variables; a book for the lay reader that misreported a study of menstruation and accidents; and a monograph on the foundations of probability that over interpreted statistically insignificant fluctuations in sex ratios.
  
And here’s the conclusion:
  
Individually, these examples are of little importance.</p><p>5 0.94345474 <a title="1887-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-13-Arnold_Zellner.html">205 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-13-Arnold Zellner</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak reports:
  
I [Ziliak] am sorry to share this sad news about Arnold Zellner (AEA Distinguished Fellow, 2002, ASA President, 1991, ISBA co-founding president, all around genius and sweet fellow), who died yesterday morning (August 11, 2010).   He was a truly great statistician and to me and to many others a generous and wonderful friend, colleague, and hero.  I will miss him.


His cancer was spreading everywhere though you wouldn’t know it as his energy level was Arnold’s typical: abnormally high.  But then he had a stroke just a few days after an unsuccessful surgery “to help with breathing” the doctor said, and the combination of events weakened him terribly.  He was vibrant through June and much of July, and maintained an 8 hour work day at the office.  He never lost his sense of humor nor his joy of life.  He died at home in hospice care and fortunately he did not suffer long.

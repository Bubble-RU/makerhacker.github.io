An independent research company, Answers Research based in San Diego, CA, conducted a study using a representative online sample of nearly 1000 people, ages 18 and older from across the US. The participants were chosen from a random survey panel and were required to have used a major search engine in the past month. Participants were not aware that Microsoft was involved.

</p><p>4 Bing and Google search results were shown side-by-side on one page for easy comparison – with all branding removed from both search engines. [sent-6, score-0.75]
</p><p>5 For each search, the participant was asked which search engine provided the best results – “Left side search engine”, “Right side search engine”, or “Draw. [sent-8, score-1.233]
</p><p>6 When the results were tallied, the outcome was clear – people chose Bing web search results over Google nearly 2:1 in the blind comparison tests. [sent-10, score-0.776]
</p><p>7 A group at Yale Law School,  October 2013 :    In advertisements associated with its ―Bing It On‖ campaign, Microsoft claimed that ―people preferred Bing web search results nearly 2:1 over Google in blind comparison tests. [sent-15, score-0.645]
</p><p>8 It seems a bit much to claim false advertising because a 2013 survey on Mechanical Turk differs from a 2012 survey on a random sample of Americans. [sent-23, score-0.526]
</p><p>9 In Microsoft’s original study, it appears that the purpose of the study was somewhat concealed, whereas the Yale study went directly through the Bing website. [sent-25, score-0.156]
</p><p>10 So, lots of differences from two very different studies performed on two very different populations under two very different conditions (see Bob’s  comment  for more on that point), a year apart. [sent-26, score-0.303]
</p><p>11 That’s a reasonable point but I think I’d prefer to go with the random sample and just reweight. [sent-30, score-0.204]
</p><p>12 In any case, it hardly seems like deceptive advertising for Microsoft to make a claim about Americans, based on a random sample of Americans. [sent-31, score-0.346]
</p><p>13 Suppose Microsoft had done a MTurk study and the Yale group turned around and found a much different result using a third-party random sample. [sent-33, score-0.212]

</p><p>15 I was thinking that, because the authors of this 2013 paper wrote that Microsoft could be sued for false advertising, that they believe that Microsoft did illegally false advertising. [sent-36, score-0.167]
</p><p>16 I’m no fan of their search engine, but their study seems much more professional to me. [sent-44, score-0.402]
</p><p>17 Ultimately, Bing wins for some searches and for some users, and Google wins for other searches and for other users. [sent-46, score-0.356]

<p>Introduction: I received the following email:
  
Did you know that it looks like Microsoft is entering the modeling game? I mean, outside of Excel. I recently received an email at work from a MS research contractor looking for ppl that program in R, SAS, Matlab, Excel, and Mathematica. . . . So far I [the person who sent me this email] haven’t seen anything about applying any actual models. Only stuff about assigning variables, deleting rows, merging tables, etc. I don’t know how common knowledge this all is within the statistical community. I did a quick google search for the name of the programming language and didn’t come up with anything.
  
That sounds cool.  Working with anything from Microsoft sounds pretty horrible, but it would be useful to have another modeling language out there, just for checking our answers if nothing else.</p><p>3 0.18644989 <a title="2054-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-18-Tips_on_%E2%80%9Cgreat_design%E2%80%9D_from_._._._Microsoft%21.html">1219 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-18-Tips on “great design” from . . .

<p>Introduction: I came across  this  (link from  here ):
  
A post . . . reminded me of a great technique I [@destraynor] learned about from Bill Buxton. Bill is a Principal Researcher in Microsoft where his main role focuses on designing a company that permits great design to happen. As many have learned to their peril, it’s not simply a case of just dumping talent in a room full of Ikea furniture. In large companies you have to design the process that creates design. One key idea Bill advocates is an emphasis on exploring the solution space before iterating on a solution. . . .
  
It goes on from there, but all I could think of was . . . this must be the first time the words “Microsoft” and “a company that permits great design to happen” have ever appeared in the same sentence.  Sure, Clippy was great and Windows Vista has changed how we think about the world, but what great things has Microsoft done lately?

<p>Introduction: One thing we do here at the Applied Statistics Center is hold mini-conferences.  The next one looks really cool.  It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods.

I could probably get a job as an entry-level programmer if I needed to.)

Because one of them is “Why are manhole covers round?”  This is an infamous Microsoft interview question that has since been so very, very banned at both companies .

If you’re used to Google upending conventional wisdom, then yesterday’s  interview with Laszlo Bock in the New York Times  did not disappoint. Google has determined that test scores and transcripts are useless because they don’t predict performance among its employees. . . .


I [Loken] am going to assume they’re well aware of the limits of their claim, and instead I’m going say that as readers of the interview we should not lose sight of a fundamental fact -

 
Across a wide variety of employment settings, one of the most robust findings in organizational psychology is that tests of cognitive ability are strong predictors of job performance. If Google has found otherwise, what they have found is that grades and test scores are not predictive of performance at Google. In general, in the workplace tests are still highly predictive of success.

<p>Introduction: This one is fun because I have a double conflict of interest:  I’ve been paid (at different times) both by Google and by Microsoft.
 
Here’s the story:
 
Microsoft,  September 2012 :
  
An independent research company, Answers Research based in San Diego, CA, conducted a study using a representative online sample of nearly 1000 people, ages 18 and older from across the US. The participants were chosen from a random survey panel and were required to have used a major search engine in the past month. Participants were not aware that Microsoft was involved.  


In the test, participants were shown the main web search results pane of both Bing and Google for 10 search queries of their choice. Bing and Google search results were shown side-by-side on one page for easy comparison – with all branding removed from both search engines. The test did not include ads or content in other parts of the page such as Bing’s Snapshot and Social Search panes and Google’s Knowledge Graph. For each search,</p><p>2 0.96635121 <a title="2054-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram_on_Mandelbrot.html">1784 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-01-Wolfram on Mandelbrot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most perfect pairing of author and subject since Nicholson Baker and John Updike.  Here’s  Wolfram on the great researcher of  fractals :
  
In his way, Mandelbrot paid me some great compliments. When I was in my 20s, and he in his 60s, he would ask about my scientific work: “How can so many people take someone so young so seriously?” In 2002, my book “A New Kind of Science”—in which I argued that many phenomena across science are the complex results of relatively simple, program-like rules—appeared. Mandelbrot seemed to see it as a direct threat, once declaring that “Wolfram’s ‘science’ is not new except when it is clearly wrong; it deserves to be completely disregarded.” In private, though, several mutual friends told me, he fretted that in the long view of history it would overwhelm his work.
  
In retrospect, I don’t think Mandelbrot had much to worry about on this account.

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.  As Antony and I worked more on our paper, and especially after seeing the discussions by Robert Kosara, Stephen Few, Hadley Wickham, and Paul Murrell (all to appear in Journal of Computati</p><p>5 0.96318519 <a title="2054-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-28-Cool_job_opening_with_brilliant_researchers_at_Yahoo.html">978 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-28-Cool job opening with brilliant researchers at Yahoo</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts writes:
  
The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>6 0.95940405 <a title="2054-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-17-How_to_map_geographically-detailed_survey_responses%3F.html">1124 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-17-How to map geographically-detailed survey responses?</a></p>

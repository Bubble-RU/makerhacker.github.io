Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: Christian points me to  this  amusing story by Jonah Lehrer about Mohan Srivastava, (perhaps the same person as R. Mohan Srivastava, coauthor of a book called Applied Geostatistics) who discovered a flaw in a scratch-off game in which he could figure out which tickets were likely to win based on partial information visible on the ticket.  It appears that scratch-off lotteries elsewhere have similar flaws in their design.
 
The obvious question is, why doesn’t the lottery create the patterns on the tickets (including which “teaser” numbers to reveal) completely at random?  It shouldn’t be hard to design this so that zero information is supplied from the outside. in which case Srivastava’s trick would be impossible.
 
So why not put down the numbers randomly?  Lehrer quotes Srivastava as saying:
  
The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers. Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random</p><p>3 0.12799734 <a title="1731-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-02-A_useful_rule_of_thumb.html">175 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-02-A useful rule of thumb</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein did an  informal study  asking people the following question:
  
When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days, what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game?
  
You can make your own guess and the continue reading below.
    
Dan writes:
  
We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting. The answers came in between 65% and 70%.






The true answer [based on Dan's analysis of a database of baseball games]: 51.3%, a little better than a coin toss.
  
I have to say, I’m surprised his colleagues gave such extreme guesses.  I was guessing something like 50%, myself, based on the following very crude reasoning:
 
Suppose two unequal teams are playing, and the chance of team A beating team B is 55%.  (This seems like a reasonable average of all matchups, which will include some more extreme disparities but also many more equal contests.)  Then the chance of the same team</p><p>3 0.74976766 <a title="1731-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-There_are_four_ways_to_get_fired_from_Caesars%3A__%281%29_theft%2C_%282%29_sexual_harassment%2C_%283%29_running_an_experiment_without_a_control_group%2C_and_%284%29_keeping_a_gambling_addict_away_from_the_casino.html">1619 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-There are four ways to get fired from Caesars:  (1) theft, (2) sexual harassment, (3) running an experiment without a control group, and (4) keeping a gambling addict away from the casino</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>5 0.73367798 <a title="1731-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-18-What%E2%80%99s_my_Kasparov_number%3F.html">2105 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-18-What’s my Kasparov number?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Personally my Kasparov number is two: I beat ** in a regular tournament game, and ** beat Kasparov!
  
That’s pretty impressive, especially given that I didn’t know this guy played chess at all!  Anyway, this got me thinking, what’s my Kasparov number?  OK, that’s easy.  I beat Magnus Carlsen the other day when he was passing through town on vacation, Carlsen beat Anand, . . .
 
OK, just kidding.  What  is  my Kasparov number, though? Note that the definition, unlike that of the Erdos or Bacon numbers, is asymmetric:  it has to be that I had a victory over person 1, and person 1 had a victory over person 2, etc., and ultimately person N-1 had a victory over Kasparov.

<p>Introduction: “Ich glaube, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung das richtige Werkzeug zum Lösen solcher Probleme ist”,  sagt Andrew Gelman , Statistikprofessor von der Columbia-Universität in New York. Wie oft aber derart knifflige Aufgaben im realen Leben auftauchen, könne er nicht sagen. Was fast schon beruhigend klingt.

<p>Introduction: These  (from Shaun Usher) are surprisingly good, especially since he appears to come up with new lists and letters pretty regularly.  I suppose a lot of them get sent in from readers, but still.
 
Here’s my favorite recent item, a  letter  sent to the Seattle Bureau of Prohibition in 1931:
  
Dear Sir:


My husband is in the habit of buying a quart of wiskey every other day from a Chinese bootlegger named Chin Waugh living at 317-16th near Alder street.


We need this money for household expenses. Will you please have his place raided? He keeps a supply planted in the garden and a smaller quantity under the back steps for quick delivery. If you make the raid at 9:30 any morning you will be sure to get the goods and Chin also as he leaves the house at 10 o’clock and may clean up before he goes.


Thanking you in advance, 


I remain 
yours truly,


Mrs. Hillyer</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90704727 <a title="1731-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-21-If_a_lottery_is_encouraging_addictive_gambling%2C_don%E2%80%99t_expand_it%21.html">1731 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-21-If a lottery is encouraging addictive gambling, don’t expand it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>5 0.86454809 <a title="1731-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-There_are_never_70_distinct_parameters.html">327 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-There are never 70 distinct parameters</a></p>

I’m a graduate student in computational biology, and I’m relatively new to advanced statistics, and am trying to teach myself how best to approach a problem I have.


My dataset is a small sparse matrix of 150 cases and 70 predictors, it is sparse as in many zeros, not many ‘NA’s.  Each case is a nutrient that is fed into an in silico organism, and its response is whether or not it stimulates growth, and each predictor is one of 70 different pathways that the nutrient may or may not belong to.  Because all of the nutrients do not belong to all of the pathways, there are thus many zeros in my matrix.  My goal is to be able to use the pathways themselves to predict whether or not a nutrient could stimulate growth, thus I wanted to compute regression coefficients for each pathway, with which I could apply to other nutrients for other species.


There are quite a few singularities in the dataset (summary(glm) reports that 14 coefficients are not defined because of sin</p><p>6 0.83899844 <a title="1731-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-29-%E2%80%9CStatistics_Done_Wrong%E2%80%9D.html">2153 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-29-“Statistics Done Wrong”</a></p>

Deadline for abstract submissions: September 16, 2013
  
  
  
WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


The Workshop for Women in Machine Learning is a day-long event taking place on the first day of NIPS. 
The workshop aims to showcase the research of women in machine learning and to strengthen their community. 
The event brings together female faculty, graduate students, and research scientists for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in pursuing machine learning research are encouraged to participate. While all presenters will be female, all genders are invited to attend.


Scholarships will be provided to female students and postdoctoral attendees with accepted abstracts to partially offset travel costs.

<p>Introduction: Chris Wiggins writes of an interesting-looking summer program that undergraduate or graduate students can apply to:
  
The hackNY Fellows program is an initiative to mentor the next generation of technology innovators in New York, focusing on tech startups. Last summer’s  class of fellows  was paired with NYC startups which demonstrated they could provide a mentoring environment (a clear project, a person who could work with the Fellow, and sufficient stability to commit to 10 weeks of compensation for the Fellow).  hackNY, with the support of the Kauffman foundation and the Internet Society of New York, provided shared housing in NYU dorms in Union Square, and organized a series of pedagogical lectures. 


hackNY was founded by Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly, Evan Korth, professor of CS at NYU, and Chris Wiggins, professor of applied mathematics at Columbia.

<p>Introduction: One thing we do here at the Applied Statistics Center is hold mini-conferences.  The next one looks really cool.  It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods.

<p>Introduction: Amanda Martinez, a writer for The Atlantic and others, advised attendees that her favorite writing “accorded me the basic human dignity of allowing me to draw my own conclusions.”
  
I really like that way of putting it, and this is something we tried hard to do with Red State Blue State, to put the information and our reasoning right there in front of the reader, rather than hiding behind a bunch of statistically-significant regression coefficients.
 
This is related to the idea of presenting research findings quantitatively (which, I think, lends itself to clearer statements of uncertainty and variation) rather than qualitatively (which seems to come out more deterministically, as “X causes Y” or “when A happens, B happens”).
 
The above quote comes from a conference of students organized by Nathan Sanders, who writes:

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW. Wondering how many interviews they discarded to get down to 601 completes? Because @ppppolls discards a LOT of interviews.

<p>Introduction: If I made a separate post for each interesting blog discussion, we’d get overwhelmed.  That’s why I often leave detailed responses in the comments section, even though I’m pretty sure that most readers don’t look in the comments at all.
 
Sometimes, though, I think it’s good to bring such discussions to light.  Here’s a recent example.
 
Michael  wrote :
  
Poor predictive performance usually indicates that the model isn’t sufficiently flexible to explain the data, and my understanding of the proper Bayesian strategy is to feed that back into your original model and try again until you achieve better performance.
  
Corey  replied :
  
It was my impression that — in ML at least — poor predictive performance is more often due to the model being too flexible and fitting noise.
  
And Rahul  agreed :
  
Good point. A very flexible model will describe your training data perfectly and then go bonkers when unleashed on wild data.

<p>Introduction: In  our discussion  of historian Niall Ferguson and piss-poor monocausal social science, commenter Matt W. pointed to Ferguson’s listing at a speakers bureau.  One of his talks is entitled “Is This the Chinese Century?”  The question mark at the end seems to give him some wiggle room.
 
I give some paid lectures myself and was curious to learn more about this organization, World Class Speakers and Entertainers, so I clicked through to  this list of topics  and then searched for Statistics.  Amazingly enough, there was a “Statistician” category (right above “Story Teller / Lore / Art / Power of Story Telling,” “Strategist / Strategies / Strategic Planning,” and “Success”).
 
There I found  Gopal C. Dorai, Ph.D. , who offers insights such as “vegetarians usually will not eat meat products, no matter how hungry they feel.”  And “Cheating or lying for the sake of obtaining favorable treatment from others will be anathema to some people.”  And “Life is a one-way-street; we cannot turn the c</p><p>5 0.93270028 <a title="2051-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-25-Question_15_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1344 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-25-Question 15 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 15. A researcher conducts a random-digit-dial survey of individuals and married couples. The design is as follows: if only one person lives in a household, he or she is interviewed. If there are multiple adults in the household, one is selected at random: he or she is interviewed and, if he or she is married to one of the other adults in the household, the spouse is interviewed as well. Come up with a scheme for inverse-probability weights (ignoring nonresponse and assuming there is exactly one phone line per household).

14. A public health survey of elderly Americans includes many questions, including “How many hours per week did you exercise in your most active years as a young adult?” and also several questions about current mobility and health status. Response rates are high for the questions about recent activities and status, but there is a lot of nonresponse for the question on past activity.

<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: April Galyardt writes:
  
I’m teaching my first graduate class this semester. It’s intro stats for graduate students in the college of education. Most of the students are first year PhD students. Though, there are a number of master’s students who are primarily in-service teachers. The difficulties with teaching an undergraduate intro stats course are still present, in that mathematical preparation and phobia vary widely across the class.


I’ve been enjoying the class and the students, but I’d like your take on an issue I’ve been thinking about. How do I balance teaching the standard methods, like hypothesis testing, that these future researchers have to know because they are so standard, with discussing the problems with those methods (e.g.  p-value as a measure of sample size , and  the decline effect , not to mention multiple testing and other common mistakes). It feels a bit like saying “Ok here’s what everybody does, but really it’s broken” and then there’s not enough time to tal</p><p>5 0.12617296 <a title="2104-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-09-My_homework_success.html">896 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-09-My homework success</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Val has reported success with the following trick:
  
Get to the classroom a few minutes earlier and turn on soft music.  Then set everything up and, the moment it’s time for class to begin, put a clicker question on the screen and turn off the music.  The students quiet down and get to work right away.
  
I’ve never liked the usual struggle with students to get them to settle down in class, as it seemed to set up a dynamic in which I was trying to get the students to focus and they were trying to goof off.  Turning off the music seems like a great non-confrontational way to send the signal that class is starting.</p><p>3 0.85016733 <a title="2104-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Online_Education_and_Jazz.html">1752 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Online Education and Jazz</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.  That ain’t right.  Let the student hold the pen.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  points  to a  news article  by Michael Winerip on teacher assessment:
  
No one at the Lab Middle School for Collaborative Studies works harder than Stacey Isaacson, a seventh-grade English and social studies teacher. She is out the door of her Queens home by 6:15 a.m., takes the E train into Manhattan and is standing out front when the school doors are unlocked, at 7. Nights, she leaves her classroom at 5:30. . . .


Her principal, Megan Adams, has given her terrific reviews during the two and a half years Ms. Isaacson has been a teacher. . . . The Lab School has selective admissions, and Ms. Isaacson’s students have excelled. Her first year teaching, 65 of 66 scored proficient on the state language arts test, meaning they got 3′s or 4′s; only one scored below grade level with a 2. More than two dozen students from her first two years teaching have gone on to . . . the city’s most competitive high schools. . . .

<p>Introduction: In response to some big new push for testing schoolchildren, Mark Palko  writes :
  
The announcement of a new curriculum is invariably followed by a round of hearty round of self congratulations and talk of “keeping standards high” as if adding a slide to a PowerPoint automatically made students better informed. It doesn’t work that way. Adding a topic to the list simply means that students will be exposed to it, not that they will understand or master or retain it.
  
Well put.  In my own teaching, I often am tempted to believe that just putting a topic in a homework problem is enough to ensure that students will learn it.  But it doesn’t work that way.  Even if they manage to somehow struggle through and solve the problem (and many don’t, or they rely on their friends’ solutions), they won’t learn much if they don’t see the connection with everything else they know.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  asks  what is the ultimate left-wing novel?  He comes up with John Steinbeck and refers us to  this list  by Josh Leach that includes soclal-realist novels from around 1900.  But Cowen is looking for something more “analytically or philosophically comprehensive.”
 
My vote for the ultimate left-wing novel is 1984.  The story and the political philosophy fit together well, and it’s also widely read (which is an important part of being the “ultimate” novel of any sort, I think; it wouldn’t do to choose something too obscure).  Or maybe Gulliver’s Travels, but I’ve never actually read that, so I don’t know if it qualifies as being left-wing.  Certainly you can’t get much more political than 1984, and I don’t think you can get much more left-wing either.  (If you get any more left-wing than that, you start to loop around the circle and become right-wing.  For example, I don’t think that a novel extolling the brilliance of Stalin or Mao would be considered left-wing in a modern</p><p>3 0.95325148 <a title="2104-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Robert_Kosara_reviews_Ed_Tufte%E2%80%99s_short_course.html">1451 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Robert Kosara reviews Ed Tufte’s short course</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This American Life  reporter Gabriel Rhodes  says :
  
This is one of the big differences between Jon and Anthony, between scientist and non-scientist. For Jon, having a year’s worth of work suddenly thrown into question is a normal day at the office. But for Anthony, that’s not normal. And it’s not OK. The time in Jon’s lab was a year of his life, where he felt like Jon kept moving the goal posts. . . . But now, Anthony wants to know, before he starts turning his life upside down again, what will count as proof enough for Jon? How many experiments?

 
Anthony Holland:  So let’s say I do three weeks of experiment, and I only concentrate on these leukemia cells. And if I can kill at least 20% every single time, every week, will that do it? Would that be enough? Or do you want to see pancreatic die, or do you want to see—I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?

<p>Introduction: We had some interesting comments on our recent  reflections  on Niall Ferguson’s ill-chosen remarks in which he attributed Keynes’s economic views (I don’t actually know exactly what Keyesianism is, but I think a key part is for the government to run surpluses during economic booms and deficits during recessions) to the Keynes being gay and marrying a ballerina and talking about poetry.  The general idea, I think, is that people without kids don’t care so much about the future, and this motivated Keynes’s party-all-the-time attitude, which might have worked just fine for Eddie Murphy’s girlfriend in the 1980s and in San Francisco bathhouses of the 1970s but, according to Ferguson, is not the ticket for preserving today’s American empire.
 
Some of the more robust defenders of Ferguson may have been disappointed by his followup remarks:  “I should not have suggested . . . that Keynes was indifferent to the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children because he was g</p><p>6 0.95150095 <a title="2104-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-24-F-f-f-fake_data.html">1735 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-24-F-f-f-fake data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: The Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University invite applications for a post-doctoral fellow position in Biostatistics.
 
We are seeking a highly motivated individual to develop novel statistical methods for missing data imputation and applications in health disparities research using national administrative data, with funding from Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality. The candidate will be jointly mentored by Dr. Yan Ma (PI of the grant) at the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS)/Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and Dr. Andrew Gelman in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. 
   
The candidate will also have excellent opportunities to collaborate with researchers in biostatistics, epidemiology, health disparities, and orthopedics through the Clinical and Translational Science Center at WCMC.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Eric Johnson (Columbia University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on the application of the latest methods of multilevel data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem:  forecasting retail sales at the individual item level.  These forecasts are used to make ordering, pricing and promotions decisions which can have significant economic impact to the retail chain such that even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions, across a large retailerâ&euro;&trade;s product line, can yield substantial margin improvements.
 
Activities focus on the development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.

<p>Introduction: David Ebert sends this along:
  
Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>3 0.83812761 <a title="1651-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-31-Meanwhile%2C_on_the_sister_blog_._._..html">882 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-31-Meanwhile, on the sister blog . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have to say, it distorts my internal incentives when I am happy to see really blatant examples of ethical lapses.  Sort of like when you’re cleaning the attic and searching for roaches:  on one hand, you’d be happy if there were none, but, still, there’s a thrill each time you find a roach and catch it—and, at that point, you want it to be a big ugly one!</p><p>5 0.78518611 <a title="1651-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-Three_hours_in_the_life_of_a_statistician.html">1001 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-Three hours in the life of a statistician</a></p>

Here’s a sample:
  
As soon as I [Kaiser] put the substring-concatenate expression together with two lines of code that generate data tables, it choked.
  
Sorta like Dashiell Hammett without the broads and the heaters.

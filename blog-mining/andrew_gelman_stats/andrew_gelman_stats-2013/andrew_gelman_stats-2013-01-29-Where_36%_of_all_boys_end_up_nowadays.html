<p>Introduction: We often hear that at the end of life, people often wish they hadn’t worked so hard.  (I’m assuming this is coming from executive types who have the option of working less, not people who had to work hard just to put food on the table.)
 
I don’t understand this.  Work is ok, but in almost any moment I much prefer relaxing to working.  Nonetheless I often wish I were working harder or had worked harder.  I don’t feel that I work too much.
 
So I don’t know what to think.  Am I just unusual?  Or maybe I already don’t work so hard, so there’s nothing for me to regret?  Or—and this is the scary option—maybe  right now  I wish I were working harder, but in twenty years I’ll regret that I spent so much time working?
 
Here’s one thing.  I like almost all the research papers I’ve written, but the vast majority (including some of my favorites) have had very few citations and, I assume, very little impact.  So maybe I worked too hard on some of them?</p><p>3 0.14605609 <a title="1697-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-03-Libertarians_in_Space.html">1097 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-03-Libertarians in Space</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After quoting from a speech where a Republican presidential candidate praises the space program, Mark Palko  writes :
  
I [Palko] don’t know what the reaction of the crowd was (the reporting wasn’t that detailed) but I’d imagine it was friendly. You can usually get a warm response from a Republican crowd by coming out in favor of manned space exploration which is, when you think about, strange as hell.


If you set out to genetically engineer a program that libertarians ought to object to, you’d probably come up with something like the manned space program. A massive government initiative, tremendously expensive, with no real role for individual initiative. Compared to infrastructure projects the benefits to business are limited. . . . There have been efforts in libertarian-leaning organs (The Wall Street Journal, Reason, John Tierney’s NYT columns) trying to argue that interplanetary exploration can be done on the cheap. These usually rely heavily on the blatant low-balling of Robert</p><p>4 0.1364776 <a title="1697-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-In_today%E2%80%99s_economy%2C_the_rich_get_richer.html">367 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-In today’s economy, the rich get richer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are  solutions to about 50 of the exercises from Bayesian Data Analysis.  The solutions themselves haven’t been updated; I just cleaned up the file:  some change in Latex had resulted in much of the computer code running off the page, so I went in and cleaned up the files.
 
I wrote most of these in 1996, and I like them a lot.  I think several of them would’ve made good journal articles, and in retrospect I wish I’d published them as such.

<p>Introduction: Curt Yeske pointed me to  this .  Wow–these graphs are really hard to read!
 
The old me would’ve said that each of these graphs would be better replaced by a dotplot (or, better still, a series of lineplots showing time trends).
 
The new me would still like the dotplots and lineplots, but I’d say it’s fine to have the eye-grabbing but hard-to-read graphs as is, and then to have the more informative statistical graphics underneath, as it were.  The idea is, you’d click on the pretty but hard-to-read “infovis” graphs, and this would then reveal informative “full Cleveland” graphs.  And then if you click again you’d get a spreadsheet with the raw numbers.
 
That I’d like to see, as a new model for graphical presentation.</p><p>4 0.60636884 <a title="1697-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-25-Great_graphs_of_names.html">2038 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-25-Great graphs of names</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Nathan Yau .  I love this stuff.  It’s just wonderful, a great set of visualizations on a great topic.
 
Offhand, the only suggestions I have are to scale the graphs or indicate in some way the trends in the total popularity of each name (as it is, I wonder if some of the variation is arising from rarity), also to me the girl color looks a bit orangish and I’d go for something more purely pink.

<p>Introduction: In his  review  in 1938 of  Historical Development of the Graphical Representation of Statistical Data , by H. Gray Funkhauser, for  The Economic Journal , the great economist writes:
  
Perhaps the most striking outcome of Mr. Funkhouser’s researches is the fact of the very slow progress which graphical methods made until quite recently. . . . In the first fifty volumes of the Statistical Journal, 1837-87, only fourteen graphs are printed altogether. It is surprising to be told that Laplace never drew a graph of the normal law of error . . . Edgeworth made no use of statistical charts as distinct from mathematical diagrams.


Apart from Quetelet and Jevons, the most important influences were probably those of Galton and of Mulhall’s Dictionary, first published in 1884. Galton was indeed following his father and grandfather in this field, but his pioneer work was mainly restricted to meteorological maps, and he did not contribute to the development of the graphical representation of ec</p><p>6 0.57596868 <a title="1697-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-05-The_Grinch_Comes_Back.html">1606 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-05-The Grinch Comes Back</a></p>

Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>5 0.86424363 <a title="1697-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-02-Reintegrating_rebels_into_civilian_life%3A_Quasi-experimental_evidence_from_Burundi.html">177 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-02-Reintegrating rebels into civilian life: Quasi-experimental evidence from Burundi</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Gilligan, Eric Mvukiyehe, and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Gilligan, Mvukiyehe, and Samii] use original survey data, collected in Burundi in the summer of 2007, to show that a World Bank ex-combatant reintegration program implemented after Burundi’s civil war caused significant economic reintegration for its beneficiaries but that this economic reintegration did not translate into greater political and social reintegration.


Previous studies of reintegration programs have found them to be ineffective, but these studies have suffered from selection bias: only ex-combatants who self selected into those programs were studied. We avoid such bias with a quasi-experimental research design made possible by an exogenous bureaucratic failure in the implementation of program. One of the World Bank’s implementing partners delayed implementation by almost a year due to an unforeseen contract dispute. As a result, roughly a third of ex-combatants had their program benefits withheld for reas</p><p>6 0.86231339 <a title="1697-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-01-bayesglm_in_Stata%3F.html">442 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-01-bayesglm in Stata?</a></p>

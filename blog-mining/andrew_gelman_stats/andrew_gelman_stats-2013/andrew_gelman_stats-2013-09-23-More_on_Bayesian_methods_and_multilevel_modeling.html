I am new to Bayesian methods.  While I am reading your book, I have some questions for you.  I am interested in doing Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression (e.g., random-intercept model) and Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM)—for causality.  Do you happen to know if I could find some articles, where authors could provide data w/ R and/or BUGS codes that I could replicate them?
  
My reply:  For Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression and causal inference, see my book with Jennifer Hill.  For Bayesian structural equation modeling, try google and you’ll find some good stuff.

<p>Introduction: A  link  from Simon Jackman’s blog led me to  an article  by James Heckman, Hedibert Lopes, and Remi Piatek from 2011, “Treatment effects:  A Bayesian perspective.”  I was pleasantly surprised to see this, partly because I didn’t know that Heckman was working on Bayesian methods, and partly because the paper explicitly refers to the “potential outcomes model,” a term I associate with Don Rubin.  I’ve had the impression that Heckman and Rubin don’t like each other (I was a student of Rubin and have never met Heckman, so I’m only speaking at second hand here), so I was happy to see some convergence.
 
I was curious how Heckman et al. would source the potential outcome model.  They do not refer to Rubin’s 1974 paper or to Neyman’s 1923 paper (which was republished in 1990 and is now taken to be the founding document of the Neyman-Rubin approach to causal inference).  Nor, for that matter, do Heckman et al. refer to the more recent developments of these theories by Robins, Pearl, and other</p><p>4 0.16309237 <a title="2033-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-11-Yes%2C_worry_about_generalizing_from_data_to_population.__But_multilevel_modeling_is_the_solution%2C_not_the_problem.html">1934 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-11-Yes, worry about generalizing from data to population.

<p>Introduction: A sociologist writes in:
  
Samuel Lucas has just published  a paper  in Quality and Quantity arguing that anything less than a full probability sample of higher levels in HLMs yields biased and unusable results. If I follow him correctly, he is arguing that not only are the SEs too small, but the parameter estimates themselves are biased and we cannot say in advance whether the bias is positive or negative.


Lucas has thrown down a big gauntlet, advising us throw away our data unless the sample of macro units is right and ignore the published results that fail this standard. Extreme. 
Is there another conclusion to be drawn? 
Other advice to be given? 
A Bayesian path out of the valley?
  
Heres’s the abstract to Lucas’s paper:

<p>Introduction: James O’Brien writes:
  
How would you explain, to a “classically-trained” hypothesis-tester, that “It’s OK to fit a multilevel model even if some groups have only one observation each”?


I [O'Brien] think I understand the logic and the statistical principles at work in this, but I’ve having trouble being clear and persuasive. I also feel like I’m contending with some methodological conventional wisdom here. 
  
My reply:  I’m so used to this idea that I find it difficult to defend it in some sort of general conceptual way.  So let me retreat to a more functional defense, which is that multilevel modeling gives good estimates,  especially  when the number of observations per group is small.
 
One way to see this in any particular example in through cross-validation.  Another way is to consider the alternatives.   If you try really hard you can come up with a “classical hypothesis testing” approach which will do as well as the multilevel model.  It would just take a lot of work.

I remember reading on your blog that you were working on some tools to fit multilevel models that also include “fixed” effects — such as continuous predictors — that are also estimated with shrinkage (for example, an L1 or L2 penalty). Any new developments on this front?


I often find myself wanting to fit a multilevel model to some data, but also needing to include a number of “fixed” effects, mainly continuous variables. This makes me wary of overfitting to these predictors, so then I’d want to use some kind of shrinkage.


As far as I can tell, the main options for doing this now is by going fully Bayesian and using a Gibbs sampler. With MCMCglmm or BUGS/JAGS I could just specify a prior on the fixed effects that corresponds to a desired penalty. However, this is pretty slow, especially with a large data set and because I’d like to select the penalty parameter by cross-validation (which is where this isn’t very Bayesian I guess?).

The idea that species diversity can influence ecosystem functioning has been controversial and its importance relative to compositional effects hotly debated. Unfortunately, assessing the relative importance of different explanatory variables in complex linear models is not simple. In this paper we assess the relative importance of species richness and species composition in a multilevel model analysis of net aboveground biomass production in grassland biodiversity experiments by estimating variance components for all explanatory variables. We compare the variance components using  a recently introduced graphical Bayesian ANOVA  [emphasis added]. We show that while the use of test statistics and the R2 gives contradictory assessments, the variance components analysis reveals that species</p><p>4 0.80422765 <a title="2033-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-11-Understanding_how_estimates_change_when_you_move_to_a_multilevel_model.html">850 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-11-Understanding how estimates change when you move to a multilevel model</a></p>

When I combined using three level hierarchical approach, all the covariates became non-significant at the population level,  and large estimates were found for variance parameters at the population level.

However, my dependent variable is a multiple imputed (m=5) reading test. The problem I have is, that I do not know, whether I can just calculate 5 linear multilevel models and then average all the results (the coefficients, standard deviation, bic, intra class correlation, R2, t-statistics, p-values etc) or if I need different formulas for integrating the results of the five models into one because it is a multilevel analysis? Do you think there’s a better way in solving my problem? I would greatly appreciate if you could help me with a problem regarding my analysis — I am quite a newbie to multilevel modeling and especially to multiple imputation. Also: Is it okay to use frequentist models when the multiple imputation was done bayesian? Would the different philosophies of sc</p><p>6 0.79868984 <a title="2033-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-06-17_groups%2C_6_group-level_predictors%3A__What_to_do%3F.html">1248 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-06-17 groups, 6 group-level predictors:  What to do?</a></p>

In a previous post, http://andrewgelman.com/2013/07/30/the-roy-causal-model/ you pointed to a paper on Bayesian methods by Heckman. At around the same time I came across another one of his papers, “The Effects of Cognitive and Noncognitive Abilities on Labor Market Outcomes and Social Behavior (2006)” (http://www.nber.org/papers/w12006 or published version http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/504455). In this paper they implement their model as follows:

 
We use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to compute the sample likelihood. Our use of Bayesian methods is only a computational convenience. Our identification analysis is strictly classical. Under our assumptions, the priors we use are asymptotically irrelevant.
 

Some of the authors have also done something similar earlier in:

<p>Introduction: Jessy, Aki, and I  write :
  
We review the Akaike, deviance, and Watanabe-Akaike information criteria from a Bayesian perspective, where the goal is to estimate expected out-of-sample-prediction error using a bias-corrected adjustment of within-sample error. We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this review is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.
  
I like this paper.  It came about as a result of preparing Chapter 7 for the  new BDA .  I had difficulty understanding AIC, DIC, WAIC, etc., but I recognized that these methods served a need.  My first plan was to just apply DIC and WAIC on a couple of simple examples (a linear regression and the 8 schools) and leave it at that.

<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>4 0.95735586 <a title="2033-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-26-WAIC_and_cross-validation_in_Stan%21.html">2349 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-26-WAIC and cross-validation in Stan!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aki and I  write :
  
The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) and cross-validation are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model. WAIC is based on the series expansion of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO), and asymptotically they are equal. With finite data, WAIC and cross-validation address different predictive questions and thus it is useful to be able to compute both. WAIC and an importance-sampling approximated LOO can be estimated directly using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. We show how to compute WAIC, IS-LOO, K-fold cross-validation, and related diagnostic quantities in the Bayesian inference package Stan as called from R.
  
This is important, I think.  One reason the deviance information criterion (DIC) has been so popular is its implementation in Bugs.  We think WAIC and cross-validation make more sense than DIC, especially from a Bayesian perspective in whic</p><p>5 0.95490986 <a title="2033-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-01-%E2%80%9CThough_They_May_Be_Unaware%2C_Newlyweds_Implicitly_Know_Whether_Their_Marriage_Will_Be_Satisfying%E2%80%9D.html">2156 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-01-“Though They May Be Unaware, Newlyweds Implicitly Know Whether Their Marriage Will Be Satisfying”</a></p>

 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years.

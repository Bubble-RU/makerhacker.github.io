<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.
 
2.

<p>Introduction: Having established that survey weighting is a mess, I should also acknowledge that, by this standard, regression modeling is also a mess, involving many arbitrary choices of variable selection, transformations and modeling of interaction. Nonetheless, regression modeling is a mess with which I am comfortable and, perhaps more relevant to the discussion, can be extended using multilevel models to get inference for small cross-classifications or small areas.

<p>Introduction: Here’s my discussion of  this article  for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
 
I will comment on this paper in my role as applied statistician and consumer of Bayesian computation.  In the last few years, my colleagues and I have felt the need to fit predictive survey responses given multiple discrete predictors, for example estimating voting given ethnicity and income within each of the fifty states, or estimating public opinion about gay marriage given age, sex, ethnicity, education, and state.  We would like to be able to fit such models with ten or more predictors–for example, religion, religious attendance, marital status, and urban/rural/suburban residence in addition to the factors mentioned above.
 
There are (at least) three reasons for fitting a model with many predictive factors and potentially a huge number of interactions among them:
 
1.  Deep interactions can be of substantive interest.  For example, Gelman et al. (2009) discuss the importance of  interaction</p><p>6 0.13333307 <a title="2117-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-25-Correlation_of_1_._._._too_good_to_be_true%3F.html">1737 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-25-Correlation of 1 . . . too good to be true?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joscha Legewie points to  this article  by Lars Ronnegard, Xia Shen, and Moudud Alam, “hglm: A Package for Fitting Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models,” which just appeared in the R journal.  This new package has the advantage, compared to lmer(), of allowing non-normal distributions for the varying coefficients.  On the downside, they seem to have reverted to the ugly lme-style syntax (for example, “fixed = y ~ week, random = ~ 1|ID” rather than “y ~ week + (1|D)”).  The old-style syntax has difficulties handling non-nested grouping factors.  They also say they can estimated models with correlated random effects, but isn’t that just the same as varying-intercept, varying-slope models, which lmer (or Stata alternatives such as gllam) can already do?  There’s also a bunch of stuff on H-likelihood theory, which seems pretty pointless to me (although probably it won’t do much harm either).
 
In any case, this package might be useful to some of you, hence this note.</p><p>3 0.68741822 <a title="2117-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-19-R_package_for_Bayes_factors.html">1682 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-19-R package for Bayes factors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following message:
  
I am a Psychology postgraduate at the University of Glasgow and am writing for an article request. I’ve just read your 2008 published article titled “A weakly informative default prior distribution for logistic and other regression models” and found from it that your group also wrote a report on applying the Bayesian logistic regression approach to multilevel model, which is titled “An approximate EM algorithm for multilevel generalized linear models”. I have been looking for it online but did find it, and was wondering if I may request this report from you?
  
My first thought is that this is a good sign that psychology undergraduates are reading papers like this.  Unfortunately I had to reply as follows:
  
Hi, we actually programmed this up but never debugged it!  So no actual paper . . .
  
I think I could’ve done it if I had ever focused on the problem.

I’d imagine you’ve already received this, but just in case, here’s a cartoon you’d like. At first blush it seems to go against your advice (more nuanced than what I’m about to say by quoting the paper title) to not worry about multiple comparisons.


However, if I understand correctly your argument about multiple comparisons in multilevel models, the situation in this comic might have been avoided if shrinkage toward the grand mean (of all colors) had prevented the greens from clearing the .05 threshold. Is that right?</p><p>6 0.67246765 <a title="2117-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-10-Multiple_imputation_and_multilevel_analysis.html">704 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-10-Multiple imputation and multilevel analysis</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Somebody emailed me:
  
I am a researcher at ** University and I have recently read your article on average predictive comparisons for statistical models published 2007 in the journal “Sociological Methodology”.


Gelman, Andrew/Iain Pardoe. 2007. “Average Predictive Comparisons for Models with Nonlinearity, Interactions, and Variance Components”. Sociological Methodology 37: 23-51.


Currently I am working with multilevel models and find your approach very interesting and useful.


May I ask you whether replication materials (e.g. R Code) for this article are available?
  
I had to reply:
  
Hi—I’m embarrassed to say that our R files are a mess!  I had ideas of programming the approach more generally as an R package but this has not yet happened yet.</p><p>2 0.96705484 <a title="2117-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-18-Misunderstanding_analysis_of_covariance.html">859 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-18-Misunderstanding analysis of covariance</a></p>

Are you familiar with Miller and Chapman’s (2001)  article : Misunderstanding Analysis of Covariance saying that ANCOVA (and therefore, I suppose regression) should not be used when groups differ on a covariate.    It has caused a moderate splash in psychology circles.  I wondered if you had any thoughts on it.
  
I had not heard of the article so I followed the link . . . ugh!  Already on the very first column of the very first page they confuse nonadditivity with nonlinearity.  I could probably continue with, “and it gets worse,” but since nobody’s paying me to read this one, I’ll stop reading right there on the first page!

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.96515977 <a title="2117-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-21-Baseball%E2%80%99s_greatest_fielders.html">623 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-21-Baseball’s greatest fielders</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone just stopped by and dropped off a copy of the book Wizardry:  Baseball’s All-time Greatest Fielders Revealed, by Michael Humphreys.  I don’t have much to say about the topic–I did see Brooks Robinson play, but I don’t remember any fancy plays.  I must have seen Mark Belanger but I don’t really recall.  Ozzie Smith was cool but I saw only him on TV.  The most impressive thing I ever saw live was Rickey Henderson stealing a base.  The best thing about that was that everyone was expecting him to steal the base, and he still was able to do it.  But that wasn’t fielding either.
 
Anyway, Humphreys was nice enough to give me a copy of his book, and since I can’t say much (I didn’t have it in me to study the formulas in detail, nor do I know enough to be able to evaluate them), I might as well say what I can say right away.
 
(Note:  Humphreys replies to some of these questions in  a comment .)

<p>Introduction: Eric Novik does some open-source  planning :
  
My co-author, Jacki Buros, and I [Novik] have just signed a contract with Apress to write a book tentatively entitled “Predictive Analytics with R”, which will cover programming best practices, data munging, data exploration, and single and multi-level models with case studies in social media, healthcare, politics, marketing, and the stock market.


Why does the world need another R book?  We think there is a shortage of books that deal with the complete and programmer centric analysis of real, dirty, and sometimes unstructured data.  Our target audience are people who have some familiarity with statistics, but do not have much experience with programming. . . .


The book is projected to be about 300 pages across 8 chapters. This is my first experience with writing a book and everything I heard about the process tells me that this is going to be a long and arduous endeavor lasting anywhere from 6 to 8 months.

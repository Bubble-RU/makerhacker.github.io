</p><p>6 Therefore, it is fair to assume Ferguson does not expect his audience to have read the papers cited throughout. [sent-13, score-0.143]
</p><p>7 Take a look for yourself:       The reader is led to believe that the five listed reasons are at or near the top of a such list created by Porter and his team. [sent-28, score-0.34]
</p><p>8 The tax system, is sixth down the list and cannot in any way be considered primary. [sent-31, score-0.216]
</p><p>9 Ferguson give a numbered list of 5 reasons, which happens not to include  any  of the top five from the cited article. [sent-37, score-0.308]
</p><p>10 And actually Ferguson’s list doesn’t even hit item #6 very accurately (as he translates “lower tax rates” into “the complexity of the tax code”). [sent-39, score-0.382]
</p><p>11 The error seems too big for him to say it was a simple transposition or slip on the part of a research assistant. [sent-43, score-0.102]
</p><p>12 First, he’d attack the messenger and say that Rao is a political opponent. [sent-45, score-0.115]
</p><p>13 Such a reaction would seem irrelevant to me—yes, Rao  is  an opponent of Ferguson’s political positions, but the evidence seems clear that Ferguson is misrepresenting that study. [sent-46, score-0.108]
</p><p>14 If you agree with the guy, you feel his heart is in the right place, and what’s the big deal if he moves a few facts around and violates the stuffy conventions of documentary film or scholarly writing? [sent-49, score-0.233]
</p><p>15 And who cares what the haters say, they’re nobodies compared to an Academy-Award-winning top-grossing film producer or a Hoover Institution professor whose lecture fees are in the high five figures and is friends with Henry Kissinger? [sent-51, score-0.279]
</p><p>16 And, indeed, if you agree with Ferguson on the big picture, maybe the details really don’t matter. [sent-55, score-0.104]
</p><p>17 What really amazes me about Ferguson is that at this point he really doesn’t seem to care about scholarly norms. [sent-56, score-0.155]
</p><p>18 As I  wrote  last year, when I’m describing someone as a hack, I’m not saying he’s political or that he’s writing something I disagree with. [sent-68, score-0.132]
</p><p>19 I feel that much of his recent writing is at worst a violation of scholarly ethics (as above) and is at best laughable and empty (as  here ), and I am repulsed by his crude attempt to get laughs by alluding to poof-like characteristics of historical figures. [sent-78, score-0.32]
</p><p>20 But I recognize that he feels he has a larger purpose; I assume he really  does  believe that it’s 1973 and the Western world is being crushed by its business-unfriendly political environment, and that the crisis is real enough that it’s worth destroying one’s scholarly reputation to address.

<p>Introduction: Life is continuous but we think in discrete terms.  In applied statistics there’s the p=.05 line which tells us whether a finding is significant or not.  Baseball has the Mendoza line.
 
And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site.

<p>Introduction: We had some interesting comments on our recent  reflections  on Niall Ferguson’s ill-chosen remarks in which he attributed Keynes’s economic views (I don’t actually know exactly what Keyesianism is, but I think a key part is for the government to run surpluses during economic booms and deficits during recessions) to the Keynes being gay and marrying a ballerina and talking about poetry.  The general idea, I think, is that people without kids don’t care so much about the future, and this motivated Keynes’s party-all-the-time attitude, which might have worked just fine for Eddie Murphy’s girlfriend in the 1980s and in San Francisco bathhouses of the 1970s but, according to Ferguson, is not the ticket for preserving today’s American empire.

He is also very, very adorable.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t want this to be a regular feature but I wanted to briefly comment on Ferguson’s  open letter  regarding the Keynes-was-a-ballet-and-poetry-loving-poof remarks he made the other day at that conference of financial advisors.  (I’m posting this one at night, and a new post on an unrelated topic is coming in the morning, so I’m burying it as much as possible.)
 
Ferguson reiterates that his remarks were “stupid.”  The question then arises:  He’s a smart guy, how did he end up saying such stupid things?  Ferguson has a history of saying high-profile stupid things, and they always seem to be when he’s trying to make some sort of political point.
 
I’m still going with  my theory  that Ferguson misjudged his audience; he thought they’d appreciate an anti-Keynes remark, maybe he even thought they were the kind of crowd that would enjoy cracks about gay people who like ballet and poetry. No go.
 
Again, I’m not trying to nail the guy to the cross for this.  We all make mistakes; in fact</p><p>5 0.43741533 <a title="1921-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-04-Jesus_historian_Niall_Ferguson_and_the_improving_standards_of_public_discourse.html">1839 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-04-Jesus historian Niall Ferguson and the improving standards of public discourse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site. The fee: 50 to 75 grand per appearance. . . .

<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of reading  this article  by Niall Ferguson summarizing his  notorious  new book.  Here’s the best bit: 
  
  
Far more than in Europe, most Americans remain instinctively loyal to the killer applications of Western ascendancy, from competition all the way through to the work ethic. They know the country has the right software. They just can’t understand why it’s running so damn slowly.


What we need to do is to delete the viruses that have crept into our system: the anticompetitive quasi monopolies that blight everything from banking to public education; the politically correct pseudosciences and soft subjects that deflect good students away from hard science; the lobbyists who subvert the rule of law for the sake of the special interests they represent—to say nothing of our crazily dysfunctional system of health care, our overleveraged personal finances, and our newfound unemployment ethic.

<p>Introduction: Ashok Rao  shreds  the latest book from Niall Ferguson, who we’ve  encountered  most recently as the source of homophobic slurs but who used to be a  serious scholar . Or maybe still is. Remember Linda, that character from the Kahneman and Tversky vignette who was deemed likely to be “a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement”? Maybe Ferguson is a serious scholar who is active in the being-a-hack movement. Perhaps when he’s  not  writing books where he distorts his sources, or giving lectures with unfortunate slurs, he’s doing historical research. It’s certainly possible.
 
Rao describes how Ferguson distorts his source materials.  This is a no-no for any historian, of course, but not such a surprise for Ferguson, who crossed over the  John Yoo line  awhile ago.
 
Last year I wrote about the paradox of influence:  Ferguson gets and keeps the big-money audience by telling them not what he (Ferguson) wants to say—not by giving them his unique insights and understanding—but rat</p><p>2 0.94235706 <a title="1921-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-23-In_which_I_disagree_with_John_Maynard_Keynes.html">1775 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-23-In which I disagree with John Maynard Keynes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his  review  in 1938 of  Historical Development of the Graphical Representation of Statistical Data , by H. Gray Funkhauser, for  The Economic Journal , the great economist writes:
  
Perhaps the most striking outcome of Mr. Funkhouser’s researches is the fact of the very slow progress which graphical methods made until quite recently. . . . In the first fifty volumes of the Statistical Journal, 1837-87, only fourteen graphs are printed altogether. It is surprising to be told that Laplace never drew a graph of the normal law of error . . . Edgeworth made no use of statistical charts as distinct from mathematical diagrams.


Apart from Quetelet and Jevons, the most important influences were probably those of Galton and of Mulhall’s Dictionary, first published in 1884. Galton was indeed following his father and grandfather in this field, but his pioneer work was mainly restricted to meteorological maps, and he did not contribute to the development of the graphical representation of ec</p><p>3 0.93646574 <a title="1921-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-23-Science%2C_ideology%2C_and_human_origins.html">483 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-23-Science, ideology, and human origins</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  link  from Tyler Cowen led me to this  long blog article  by Razib Khan, discussing some recent genetic findings on human origins in the context of the past twenty-five years of research and popularization of science.
  

 
I don’t know much about human origins (beyond my ooh-that’s-cool reactions to exhibits at the Natural History Museum, my general statistician’s skepticism at various over-the-top claims I’ve heard over the years about “mitochondrial Eve” and the like, and various bits I’ve read over the years regarding when people came over to Australia, America, etc.), but what particularly interested me about Khan’s article was his discussion about the various controversies among scientists, his own reactions when reading and thinking about these issues as they were happening (Khan was a student at the time), and the interaction between science and political ideology.
 
There’s a limit to how far you can go with this sort of cultural criticism of science, and Khan realizes this</p><p>4 0.93488276 <a title="1921-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>5 0.93461442 <a title="1921-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-30-That_puzzle-solving_feeling.html">492 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-30-That puzzle-solving feeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since  this blog  in November, I’ve given my talk on infovis vs. statistical graphics about five times:  once in person (at the visualization meetup in NYC, a blog away from Num Pang!) and the rest via telephone conferencing or skype. The live presentation was best, but the  remote talks  have been improving, and I’m looking forward to doing more of these in the future to save time and reduce pollution.
 
 Here are the powerpoints of the talk. 
 
Now that I’ve got it working well (mostly by cutting lots of words on the slides), my next step will be to improve the interactive experience.  At the very least, I need to allocate time after the talk for discussion.  People usually don’t ask a lot of questions when I speak, so maybe the best strategy is to allow a half hour following the talk for people to speak with me individually.  It could be set up so that I’m talking with one person but the others who are hanging out could hear the conversation too.
 
Anyway, one of the times I gave th</p><p>6 0.93448722 <a title="1921-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics%3A__What_went_wrong%3F.html">1060 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-15-Freakonomics:  What went wrong?</a></p>

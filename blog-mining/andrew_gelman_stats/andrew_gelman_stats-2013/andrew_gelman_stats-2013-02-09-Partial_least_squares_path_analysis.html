<p>Introduction: Ilya Esteban writes:
  
In your blog your advice for performing regression  in the presence of large numbers of correlated features, has been to use composite scores and hierarchical modeling. Unfortunately, many problems don’t provide an obvious and unambiguous way of grouping features together (e.g. gene expression data). Are there any techniques that you would recommend that automatically pool correlated features together based on the data, without requiring the researcher to manually define composite scores or feature hierarchies?
  
I don’t know the answer to this but I imagine something is possible . . . any ideas? 
   
In the meantime I’m reminded of  this recent article  by Shaw-Hwa Lo, Haitian Wang, Tian Zheng, and Inchi Hu:

I’m exploring HLMs and stan, using your book with Jennifer Hill as my field guide to this new territory. I think I have a generally clear grasp on the material, but wanted to be sure I haven’t gone astray. 


The problem in working on involves a multi-nation survey of students, and I’m especially interested in understanding the effects of country, religion, and sex, and the interactions among those factors (using IRT to estimate individual-level ability, then estimating individual, school, and country effects).


Following the basic approach laid out in chapter 13 for such interactions between levels, I think I need to create a matrix of indicator variables for religion and sex. Elsewhere in the book, you recommend against indicator variables in favor of a single index variable.

I’m writing to you to ask about the “R-squared” approximation procedure you suggest in your 2004 book with Dr. Hill.  [See also  this paper  with Pardoe---ed.]


I’m a media sociologist at the University of Houston.  I’ve been using HLM3 for about two years.  


Briefly about my data.  It’s a content analysis of news stories with a continuous scale dependent variable, story prominence.  I have 6090 news stories, 114 newspapers, and 59 newspaper group owners.  All the Level-1, Level-2 and dependent variables have been standardized. Since the means were zero anyway, we left the variables uncentered.  All the Level-3 ownership groups and characteristics are dichotomous scales that were left uncentered.  


PROBLEM:  The single most important result I am looking for is to compare the strength of nine competing Level-1 variables in their ability to predict and explain the outcome variable, story prominence.

<p>Introduction: Paul Alper writes:
  
I do not believe your blog has ever dealt with the following phenomenon which might be called “(widening) moving the goalposts.”  Drug companies and the medical world at large often create powerful drugs and procedures for people who are far (many standard deviations) from the norm (mean) and via  randomized clinical trials, the relevant authorities approve.  But there aren’t enough of those people to be truly profitable so the next step is to ask for approval to prescribe the same for people who aren’t that far (fewer standard deviations) from the norm.  Or, just move the norm (center) so as to pick up a much larger number of patients.  Afflictions include hypertension, cholesterol, overweight, osteoporosis.  


The result is what is often called “the worried well,” who receive little or no benefit but suffer harms from the treatment.

<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

 
The hazards posed by climate change, sea level rise, and severe storm surges make this the time to transform our coastal cities through adaptive design. The conventional response to flooding, in recent history, has been hard engineering — fortifying the coastal infrastructure with seawalls and bulkheads to protect real estate at the expense of natural t</p><p>2 0.91422176 <a title="1714-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-Tenure_lets_you_handle_students_who_cheat.html">1028 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-Tenure lets you handle students who cheat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>3 0.90864575 <a title="1714-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-But_it_all_goes_to_pay_for_gas%2C_car_insurance%2C_and_tolls_on_the_turnpike.html">9 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-But it all goes to pay for gas, car insurance, and tolls on the turnpike</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a New Yorker I think I’m obliged to pass on the occasional Jersey joke (most recently,  this one , which annoyingly continues to attract spam comments).  I’ll let the above title be my comment on this  entry  from Tyler Cowen entitled, “Which Americans are ‘best off’?”:
  
If you consult human development indices the answer is Asians living in New Jersey.  The standard is:

 
The index factors in life expectancy at birth, educational degree attainment among adults 25-years or older, school enrollment for people at least three years old and median annual gross personal earnings.
 
  
More generally, these sorts of rankings and ndexes seem to be cheap ways of grabbing headlines.  This has always irritated me but really maybe I should go with the flow and invent a few of these indexes myself.</p><p>4 0.90511197 <a title="1714-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-26-WAIC_and_cross-validation_in_Stan%21.html">2349 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-26-WAIC and cross-validation in Stan!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aki and I  write :
  
The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) and cross-validation are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model. WAIC is based on the series expansion of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO), and asymptotically they are equal. With finite data, WAIC and cross-validation address different predictive questions and thus it is useful to be able to compute both. WAIC and an importance-sampling approximated LOO can be estimated directly using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. We show how to compute WAIC, IS-LOO, K-fold cross-validation, and related diagnostic quantities in the Bayesian inference package Stan as called from R.
  
This is important, I think.  One reason the deviance information criterion (DIC) has been so popular is its implementation in Bugs.  We think WAIC and cross-validation make more sense than DIC, especially from a Bayesian perspective in whic</p><p>5 0.90106225 <a title="1714-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-04-Burgess_on_Kipling.html">16 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-04-Burgess on Kipling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my last entry derived from  Anthony Burgess’s book reviews , and it’ll be short.  His review of Angus Wilson’s “The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling:  His Life and Works” is a wonderfully balanced little thing.  Nothing incredibly deep–like most items in the collection, the review is only two pages long–but I give it credit for being a rare piece of Kipling criticism I’ve seen that (a) seriously engages with the politics, without (b) congratulating itself on bravely going against the fashions of the politically incorrect chattering classes by celebrating Kipling’s magnificent achievement blah blah blah.  Instead, Burgess shows respect for Kipling’s work and puts it in historical, biographical, and literary context.
 
Burgess concludes that Wilson’s book “reminds us, in John Gross’s words, that Kipling ‘remains a haunting, unsettling presence, with whom we still have to come to terms.’  Still.”  Well put, and generous of Burgess to end his review with another’s quote.

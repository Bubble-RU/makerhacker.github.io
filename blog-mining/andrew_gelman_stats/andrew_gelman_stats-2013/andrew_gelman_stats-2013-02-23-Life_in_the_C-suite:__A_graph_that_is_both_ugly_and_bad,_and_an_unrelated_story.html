He hates it:
  
First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.e. the pinch point in the glass) is actually 3-5 years in the future and the past sand includes “up to three years” in the future.  Then there are the percentages which are appear to represent a vertical distance, not volume of sand or width of the hourglass.  Add to that a strange color scheme in which green goes from dark to light to dark again.


I know January’s not even finished yet, but surely a competitor for worst infographic of 2013?
  
Keirstead doesn’t even comment on what I see as the worst aspect of the graph, which is that the “3-5 years” band is the narrowest on the graph, but expressed as a per-year rate it is actually the  highest  of all the percentages.  The hourglass visualization does the astounding feat of taking the period where the executives expect the highest rate of change and presenting it as a minimum in the graph.</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Jemes Keirstead sends along  this infographic :       He hates it:    First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.

</p><p>9 The bit on the above infographic about “C-level execs” reminds me of something that happened a couple years ago, when I was invited to speak at an event, “called “The 2012 Election: Predicted Outcomes and Implications for Your Business,” for “an association of C-suite executives.

<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email with the subject line “A terrible infographic,” and it went on from there:  “Given some of your recent writing on infovis, I thought you might get a kick out of this . . . I’m certainly sympathetic to their motivations, but some of these plots do not aid understanding…  To pick on a few in particular, the first plot attached, cropped from the infographic, is a strange alternative to a bar plot.  For the second attachment, I still don’t understand what they’ve plotted. . . .”
 
I agree with everything he wrote, but this point I think I’m getting too exhausted to laugh at graphs unless there is an obvious political bias to point to.</p><p>3 0.11881097 <a title="1734-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-21-Bad_graph.html">863 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-21-Bad graph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein points us to  this :
 
 
 
It’s a good infographic–it grabs the reader’s eye ( see discussion here ), no?
 
P.S.  The above remark is  not  meant as a dig at infographics.  On the contrary, I am sincerely saying that a graph that violates all statistical principles and does not do a good job at displaying data, can still be valuable and useful as a data graphic.  For this infographic, the numbers are used as ornamentation to attract the viewer, just as one might use a cartoon or a dramatic photo image.
 
P.P.S.  At Hadley’s suggestion (see comment below), I’ve changed all uses of “infovis” above to “infographic.”</p><p>4 0.092113018 <a title="1734-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-30-Bill_Gates%E2%80%99s_favorite_graph_of_the_year.html">2154 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-30-Bill Gates’s favorite graph of the year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the subject line “Blog bait!”, Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  post at the Washington Post blog:
  
For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.


    
Infographic by Thomas Porostocky for WIRED.


“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>5 0.089079179 <a title="1734-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>6 0.087968841 <a title="1734-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-14-Desecration_of_valuable_real_estate.html">572 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-14-Desecration of valuable real estate</a></p>

 Chapter 1 


On Sunday we were over on 125 St so I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Jesus Taco was next door so I went there instead.  What a mistake!  I don’t know what Masanao and Yu-Sung could’ve been thinking.  Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn’t impress me).  I’m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I’m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn’t tell anyone.  I can’t really figure out why I’m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.  It’s a good deal:  they’re small but not that small.

Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized.

<p>Introduction: Jemes Keirstead sends along  this infographic :
 
 
 
He hates it:
  
First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.e. the pinch point in the glass) is actually 3-5 years in the future and the past sand includes “up to three years” in the future.  Then there are the percentages which are appear to represent a vertical distance, not volume of sand or width of the hourglass.  Add to that a strange color scheme in which green goes from dark to light to dark again.


I know January’s not even finished yet, but surely a competitor for worst infographic of 2013?
  
Keirstead doesn’t even comment on what I see as the worst aspect of the graph, which is that the “3-5 years” band is the narrowest on the graph, but expressed as a per-year rate it is actually the  highest  of all the percentages.  The hourglass visualization does the astounding feat of taking the period where the executives expect the highest rate of change and presenting it as a minimum in the graph.</p><p>3 0.8974641 <a title="1734-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Statisticians%E2%80%99_abbreviations_are_even_less_interesting_than_these%21.html">1257 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Statisticians’ abbreviations are even less interesting than these!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010. The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>5 0.86941481 <a title="1734-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-17-%E2%80%9C2%25_per_degree_Celsius_._._._the_magic_number_for_how_worker_productivity_responds_to_warm-hot_temperatures%E2%80%9D.html">1500 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-17-“2% per degree Celsius . . . the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm-hot temperatures”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang shares some bad news:
 
   
 
   
  
Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.


Chris Sheehan just sent me  this NYT article on air conditioning , where they mention this neat natural experiment:

 
[I]n the past year, [Japan] became an unwitting laboratory to study even more extreme air-conditioning abstinence, and the results have not been encouraging.

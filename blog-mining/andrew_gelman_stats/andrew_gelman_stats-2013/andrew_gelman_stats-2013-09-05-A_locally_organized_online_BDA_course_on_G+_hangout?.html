<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

(actually, in 5 minutes)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s the link .
 
When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?  Thanks.</p><p>4 0.18582951 <a title="2009-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-14-BDA_class_G%2B_hangout_another_try.html">2100 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-14-BDA class G+ hangout another try</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tomorrow (Thurs) 8h30 (Paris time) I will be teaching my Bayesian Data Analysis  class  (class4a.pdf and class4b.pdf, you can follow the slides  here ).
 
We had  problems  earlier with the regular G+ hangout, so this time we’re trying the G+ On-Air Hangout which I think should work better.
 
I’ll post a blog entry tomorrow with a link to the hangout.  Let’s hope for the best!</p><p>5 0.16940984 <a title="2009-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-How_best_to_learn_R%3F.html">65 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-How best to learn R?</a></p>

I [Bell] just finished “The Emperor of All Maladies” from 2010. One of the sections is captioned with the “In God we trust, all others bring data” quote which is supposedly from Deming. If you haven’t read it, I think you might like it even though the topic is pretty morbid (i.e. cancer).


I was rereading chapter 7 in Bayesian Data Analysis. While the principles there would allow me to “roll my own”, I was wondering whether or not there is now a comprehensive “cookbook” out there that gathers together such analyses for a variety of experimental designs – sort of a Bayesian equivalent to Montgomery’s “Design and Analysis of Experiments”.
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know, but now I’m thinking we should put some of this in our forthcoming book, Statistics for Psychology Research.

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.  As I  wrote last month , I respe</p><p>6 0.72191828 <a title="2009-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-09-My_homework_success.html">896 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-09-My homework success</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Eoin Lawless wrote me:
  
I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.


My question: you are obviously evangelical about the benefits that Bayesian statistics brings, have you ever considered producing a Coursera (or similar) cour</p><p>2 0.97843921 <a title="2009-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-24-Parables_vs._stories.html">2184 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-24-Parables vs. stories</a></p>
<p>Introduction: God is in every leaf of every tree , but he is not in every leaf of every parable.
 
Let me explain with a story.  A few months ago I  read  the new book, Doing Data Science, by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neal, and I came across the following motivation for comprehensive integration of data sources, a story that is reminiscent of the parables we sometimes see in business books:
  
By some estimates, one or two patients died per week in a certain smallish town because of the lack of information flow between the hospital’s emergency room and the nearby mental health clinic. In other words, if the records had been easier to match, they’d have been able to save more lives. On the other hand, if it had been easy to match records, other breaches of confidence might also have occurred. Of course it’s hard to know exactly how many lives are at stake, but it’s nontrivial.
  
The moral:
  
We can assume we think privacy is a generally good thing. . . . But privacy takes lives too, as we see from</p><p>3 0.9773984 <a title="2009-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-26-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">110 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-26-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s an article  that I believe is flat-out entertaining to read.  It’s about philosophy, so it’s supposed to be entertaining, in any case.
 
Here’s the abstract:
  
A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.






Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but</p><p>4 0.97712398 <a title="2009-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-Lottery_probability_update.html">731 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-Lottery probability update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It was reported  last year  that the national lottery of Israel featured the exact same 6 numbers (out of 45) twice in the same month, and statistics professor Isaac Meilijson of Tel Aviv University was quoted as saying that “the incident of six numbers repeating themselves within a month is an event of once in 10,000 years.”
 
I shouldn’t mock when it comes to mathematics–after all, I proved a false theorem once!  (Or, to be precise, my collaborator and I published a false claim which we thought we’d proved, thus we thought was a theorem.)
 
So let me retract the mockery and move, first to the mathematics and then to the statistics.
  

 
First, how many possibilities are there in pick 6 out of 45?  It’s (45*44*43*42*41*40)/6! = 8,145,060.  Let’s call this number N.
 
Second, what’s the probability that the same numbers repeat in a single calendar month?  I’ve been told that the Israeli lottery has 2 draws per week,  That’s 104/12=8.67 draws per month.  Or maybe they skip some holiday</p><p>5 0.97576255 <a title="2009-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell_and_Chabris%2C_David_and_Goliath%2C_and_science_writing_as_stone_soup.html">2058 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell and Chabris, David and Goliath, and science writing as stone soup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The only thing is, I’m not sure who’s David here and who is Goliath.  From the standpoint of book sales, Gladwell is Goliath for sure.  On the other hand, Gladwell’s credibility has been weakened over the years by fights with bigshots such as Steven Pinker.  Maybe the best analogy is a boxing match where Gladwell stands in the ring and fighter after fighter is sent in to bang him up.  At some point the heavyweight gets a little bit tired. (Recently Gladwell had a New Yorker column defending dopers such as Lance Armstrong, so I suspect he’ll have Kaiser Fung  coming  after him  again , once the current lucha with Chabris is over.)
 
Chabris took his swing at Gladwell a few days ago, as I reported  here .
 
Yesterday was Gladwell’s  turn .  I have a lot of sympathy for the Blink-man here:  he writes these bestsellers and puts himself out there, so he’s a target.  If Gladwell’s books were generic business-bestseller pap of the be-yourself-and-be-tough variety, he wouldn’t get hassled.

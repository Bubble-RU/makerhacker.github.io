<p>Introduction: A colleague asks:
  
When I search the web, I find  the story  [of the article by Said, Wegman, et al. on social networks in climate research, which was recently bumped from the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis because of plagiarism] only on blogs, USA Today, and UPI.  Why is that?  Any idea why it isn’t reported by any of the major newspapers?
  
Here’s my answer:
 
1.  USA Today broke the story.  Apparently this USA Today reporter put a lot of effort into it.  The NYT doesn’t like to run a story that begins, “Yesterday, USA Today reported…”
 
2.  To us it’s big news because we’re statisticians.  [The main guy in the study, Edward Wegman, won the Founders Award from the American Statistical Association a few years ago.]  To the rest of the world, the story is:  “Obscure prof at an obscure college plagiarized an article in a journal that nobody’s ever heard of.”  When a Harvard scientist paints black dots on white mice and says he’s curing cancer, that’s news.

 The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds 


My favorite statistics demonstration is the one with the bag of candies. I’ve elaborated upon it since including it in  the Teaching Statistics book  and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.


 Preparation 


Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it’s exactly 100.


You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.


Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.

I think I am having an existential crisis.


I used to work with animals (rats, mice, gerbils etc.) Then I started to work in marketing research where we did have some kind of random sampling procedure. So up until a few years ago, I was sort of okay.


Now I am teaching marketing research, and I feel like there is no real random sampling anymore. I take pains to get students to understand what random means, and then the whole lot of inferential statistics.  Then almost anything they do – the sample is not random. They think I am contradicting myself.  They use convenience samples at every turn – for their school work, and the enormous amount on online surveying that gets done. Do you have any suggestions for me?


Other than say, something like  this .

<p>Introduction: Jimmy pointed me to  this  blog by Drew Conway on word clouds.  I don’t have much to say about Conway’s specifics–word clouds aren’t really my thing, but I’m glad that people are thinking about how to do them better–but I did notice one phrase of his that I’ll dispute.  Conway writes
  
The best data visualizations should stand on their own . . .
  
I disagree.  I prefer the saying, “A picture plus 1000 words is better than two pictures or 2000 words.”  That is, I see a positive interaction between words and pictures or, to put it another way, diminishing returns for words or pictures on their own.  I don’t have any big theory for this, but I think, when expressed as a joint value function, my idea makes sense.  Also, I live this suggestion in my own work.  I typically accompany my graphs with long captions and I try to accompany my words with pictures (although I’m not doing it here, because with the software I use, it’s much easier to type more words than to find, scale, and insert i</p><p>6 0.1098908 <a title="1943-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-18-uuuuuuuuuuuuugly.html">1862 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-18-uuuuuuuuuuuuugly</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: While visiting the education school at the University of Pennsylvania a couple months ago, I had a long conversation with Bob Boruch, a prominent researcher in the field of evidence-based education.  We shared  Fred Mosteller stories  and talked about a lot of other things too.
 
Boruch sent me an article about teaching randomized controlled trials to education students, which gave me the following idea which connects to my longstanding embarrassment (and subject of my next column on ethics, forthcoming in Chance magazine) about the lack of systematic measurement, sampling, or experimentation in our own teaching efforts.
 
Anyway, here’s my idea for experimentation in statistics teaching, an idea that I think could work particularly well in classes with education students.
 
Each class could, as part of the course, design an educational experiment to be performed on next year’s class.  Easier said than done, I know, but perhaps ed school students would be particularly motivated to do t</p><p>5 0.75404483 <a title="1943-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-13-Student_project_competition.html">1008 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-13-Student project competition</a></p>

I [Guan] recently began a collaboration with OpenIntro, a group of volunteers from around the country (Duke, Harvard, UCLA, and U.Miami) focused on contributing to improvements in introductory statistics education. They are an active group that has a lot of energy and neat ideas.


On behalf of OpenIntro, I’d like to invite the students in your introductory statistics course to participate in a student project competition we are sponsoring this semester. Chris Barr (Assistant Professor at Harvard Biostatistics) and I are co-chairing the competition this Fall. We are hoping to highlight the excellent work that students do by hosting the two best projects from each class at OpenIntro.org and publishing the winners of a larger competition in a paperback volume with brief discussion about each project.


Details of the competition can be found at openintro.org/stat/comp.

<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96079749 <a title="1943-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-18-Data_to_use_for_in-class_sampling_exercises%3F.html">1943 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-18-Data to use for in-class sampling exercises?</a></p>

I teach a high school (grade 11) statistics class outside the USA and I am always looking for hands-on demonstrations.  In fact, last week (the start of our school year here), I did the in-class exercise about “guessing ages of ten pictures” (p. 11-13) from your  book  “Teaching Statistics – A Bag of Tricks”.


I am interested in using the “candy weighing”  demonstration  (p. 120-121) to talk about random sampling.


I agree with your advice (p.48, Sec 5.1) that it’s better to have students do sampling from actual populations.  I also agree with your suggestion that actual doing personal interviews is not an effective use of time, except for larger projects.


To that end, can you suggest some sources of actual population data that I could use in class?  As I am outside the USA (in Thailand), we do not have phonebooks here.  Certainly, this must soon be a problem for people in the USA with phonebooks going the way of the 8-track tape.

A colleague recently forwarded to me your 2012  paper  with Hill and Yajima on the multiple comparison “non-problem”, as I call it.


You and your colleagues might find of interest  a 2012 paper  [with Celia Lombardi] that reaches similar conclusions by a colleague and myself which is attached. Similar but not identical, as we are a bit Bayesian-shy after seeing so many exaggerated claims made for Bayesian approaches over recent decades. 


I take pride in having for a few decades defended many colleagues against editors (and many graduate students against faculty members) who demanded “corrections” for multiple comparisons. We’ve gotten no small number of editors and professors to back off their unreasonable demands. Paper tigers all!

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

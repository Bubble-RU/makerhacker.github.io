<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who wishes to remain anonymous:
  
My colleague and I are trying to understand the best way to approach a problem involving measuring a group of individuals’ abilities across time, and are hoping you can offer some guidance.


We are trying to analyze the combined effect of two distinct groups of people (A and B, with no overlap between A and B) who collaborate to produce a binary outcome, using a mixed logistic regression along the lines of the following.


Outcome ~ (1 | A) + (1 | B) + Other variables


What we’re interested in testing was whether the observed A random effects in period  1 are predictive of the A random effects in the following period 2.  Our idea being create two models, each using a different period’s worth of data, to create two sets of A coefficients, then observe the relationship between the two.  If the A’s have a persistent ability across periods, the coefficients should be correlated or show a linear-ish relationshi</p><p>6 0.12263158 <a title="1976-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-27-Annals_of_spam.html">1871 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-27-Annals of spam</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the inbox today, under the header, “Hidden Costs behind Milk & Dairy Consumption (video)”:
  
Hey Professor Gelman,


Our site’s production team recently released a short video uncovering the local and global impact that milk has on our lives.


After spending some time on your posts, I noticed you talked about dairy products and milk so I thought I’d email you. Are you the correct person to contact in regards to the content on the site? 


If so, let me know if you’re interested in checking out the video.


Thanks, 
Emily S.
  
Hmmm . . . I guess I do talk a lot about dairy products and milk on this site!</p><p>4 0.72445959 <a title="1976-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-07-Hipmunk_FAIL%3A__Graphics_without_content_is_not_enough.html">894 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-07-Hipmunk FAIL:  Graphics without content is not enough</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love a good GUI but not if it doesn’t give me the information I need.  I  again  tried Hipmunk and it  again  failed (this time for a trip to Baltimore where it gave only a useless subset of the available Amtrak trains).
 
   
 
I don’t know anything about the internet biz.  What I’m guessing is that they set up this cool website that is pretty much functional, with the goal of selling it for a few million dollars to Travelocity or Expedia or Kayak.  What I’m wondering is, why haven’t they made the deal already?  Hipmunk’s GUI is great.  The site is useless because it’s missing so many flights, but if you put it in an actual travel site such as Expedia, it would be great.
 
It’s enough to make me want to hit someone with an i-phone . . .</p><p>5 0.69799834 <a title="1976-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated%3A__A_place_to_post_your_statistics_questions.html">1061 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-16-CrossValidated:  A place to post your statistics questions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A friend with a baby who was born a couple weeks late commented that he would’ve liked a website that gave an estimated due date that was something more accurate than the usual “last menstrual period + 40 weeks.”  I did a quick google and found  this  and  this .  Based on their descriptions of what information they use, the first site looks like it might be good, and the second site looks iffy.  But I don’t really know.</p><p>2 0.92712182 <a title="1976-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-05-The_p-value_is_not_._._..html">1607 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-05-The p-value is not . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From a recent email exchange:
 
I agree that you should never compare p-values directly.  The p-value is a strange nonlinear transformation of data that is only interpretable under the null hypothesis. Once you abandon the null (as we do when we observe something with a very low p-value), the p-value itself becomes irrelevant.  To put it another way, the p-value is a measure of evidence, it is not an estimate of effect size (as it is often treated, with the idea that a p=.001 effect is larger than a p=.01 effect, etc).  Even conditional on sample size, the p-value is not a measure of effect size.</p><p>3 0.92548943 <a title="1976-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-21-%E2%80%9CHow_segregated_is_your_city%3F%E2%80%9D%3A__A_story_of_why_every_graph%2C_no_matter_how_clear_it_seems_to_be%2C_needs_a_caption_to_anchor_the_reader_in_some_numbers.html">289 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-21-“How segregated is your city?”:  A story of why every graph, no matter how clear it seems to be, needs a caption to anchor the reader in some numbers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.  But what’s amazing i</p><p>4 0.91117239 <a title="1976-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-27-Caffeine_keeps_your_Mac_awake.html">975 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-27-Caffeine keeps your Mac awake</a></p>

I [Mulford] ran across  this blog post  and found myself questioning the relevance of the test used.


I’d think Chi-Square would be inappropriate for trying to measure significance of choice in the manner presented here; irrespective of the cute hamster.  Since this is a common test for marketers and website developers – I’d be interested in which techniques you might suggest?


For tests of this nature, I typically measure a variety of variables (image placement, size, type, page speed, “page feel” as expressed in a factor, etc) and use LOGIT, Cluster and possibly a simple Bayesian model to determine which variables were most significant (chosen). Pearson Chi-squared may be used to express relationships between variables and outcome but I’ve typically not used it to simply judge a 0/1 choice as statistically significant or not.

<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  discussed  the evaluation of somewhat-plausible claims that are somewhat supported by theory and somewhat supported by statistical evidence.  One point I raised was that an implausibly large estimate of effect size can be cause for concern:
  
Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the name-choice article by Pelham et al.) argued that the implied effects were too large to be believed (just as I was arguing above regarding the July 4th study), which makes more plausible his claims that the results arise from methodological artifacts.


That calculation is straight Bayes: the distribution of systematic errors has much longer tails than the distribution of random errors, so the larger the estimated effect, the more likely it is to be a mistake. This little theoretical result is a bit annoying, because it is the larger effects that are the most interesting!”

<p>Introduction: In my discussion of dentists-named-Dennis study, I referred to my back-of-the-envelope  calculation  that the effect (if it indeed exists) corresponds to an approximate 1% aggregate chance that you’ll pick a profession based on your first name.  Even if there are nearly twice as many dentist Dennises as would be expected from chance alone, the base rate is so low that a shift of 1% of all Dennises would be enough to do this.  My point was that (a) even a small effect could show up when looking at low-frequency events such as the choice to pick a particular career or live in a particular city, and (b) any small effects will inherently be difficult to detect in any direct way.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.14283402 <a title="797-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-05-The_p-value_is_not_._._..html">1607 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-05-The p-value is not . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From a recent email exchange:
 
I agree that you should never compare p-values directly.  The p-value is a strange nonlinear transformation of data that is only interpretable under the null hypothesis. Once you abandon the null (as we do when we observe something with a very low p-value), the p-value itself becomes irrelevant.  To put it another way, the p-value is a measure of evidence, it is not an estimate of effect size (as it is often treated, with the idea that a p=.001 effect is larger than a p=.01 effect, etc).  Even conditional on sample size, the p-value is not a measure of effect size.</p><p>6 0.13830295 <a title="797-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-10-3_years_out_of_date_on_the_whole_Dennis_the_dentist_thing%21.html">2166 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-10-3 years out of date on the whole Dennis the dentist thing!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There’s something satisfying about seeing the same error being made by commentators on the left and the right.  In this case, we’re talking about  the one-way street fallacy , which is the implicit assumption of unidirectionality in a setting that actually has underlying symmetry.
 
1.  A month or so ago we  reported  on an op-ed by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who was discussing recent research exemplified by the headline, “Study: Having daughters makes parents more likely to be Republican.”  Douthat wrote all about different effects of having girls, without realizing that the study was comparing parents of girls to parents of boys.  He just as well could have talked about the effects of having sons, and how that is associated with voting for Democrats (according to the study).

<p>Introduction: Josef Fruehwald  writes :
  
In the past few years, the empirical foundations of the social sciences, especially Psychology, have been coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. For example, there was the New Yorker piece from 2010 called “The Truth Wears Off” about the “decline effect,” or how the effect size of a phenomenon appears to decrease over time. . . .


I [Fruehwald] am a linguist. Do the problems facing psychology face me? To really answer that, I first have to decide which explanation for the decline effect I think is most likely, and I think Andrew Gelman’s proposal is a good candidate:

 
The short story is that if you screen for statistical significance when estimating small effects, you will necessarily overestimate the magnitudes of effects, sometimes by a huge amount.
 

I’ve put together some R code to demonstrate this point. Let’s say I’m looking at two populations, and unknown to me as a researcher, there is a small difference between the two, even though they</p><p>6 0.78997552 <a title="797-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-24-%E2%80%9CEdlin%E2%80%99s_rule%E2%80%9D_for_routinely_scaling_down_published_estimates.html">2223 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-24-“Edlin’s rule” for routinely scaling down published estimates</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Around these parts we see a continuing flow of unusual claims supported by some statistical evidence.  The claims are varyingly plausible a priori.  Some examples (I won’t bother to supply the links; regular readers will remember these examples and newcomers can find them by searching):
 
- Obesity is contagious 
- People’s names affect where they live, what jobs they take, etc. 
- Beautiful people are more likely to have girl babies 
- More attractive instructors have higher teaching evaluations 
- In a basketball game, it’s better to be behind by a point at halftime than to be ahead by a point 
- Praying for someone without their knowledge improves their recovery from heart attacks 
- A variety of claims about ESP
 
How should we think about these claims?  The usual approach is to evaluate the statistical evidence–in particular, to look for reasons that the claimed results are not really statistically significant.  If nobody can shoot down a claim, it survives.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.

Perhaps this will clarify:  In a typical economics research pap</p><p>3 0.96462518 <a title="797-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written_slam_on_moderately_celebrated_writers_is_amusing_nonetheless.html">204 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written slam on moderately celebrated writers is amusing nonetheless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>5 0.96446985 <a title="797-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-15-Question_5_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1322 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-15-Question 5 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 5. Which of the following better describes changes in public opinion on most issues? (Choose only one.)
 
(a) Dynamic stability: On any given issue, average opinion remains stable but liberals and conservatives move back and forth in opposite directions (the “accordion model”)
 
(b) Uniform swing: Average opinion on an issue can move but the liberals and conservatives don’t move much relative to each other (the disribution of opinions is a “solid block of wood”)
 
(c) Compensating tradeoffs: When considering multiple survey questions on the same general topic, average opinion can move sharply to the left or right on individual questions while the average over all the questions remains stable (the “rubber band model”)

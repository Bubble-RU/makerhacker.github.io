<p>Introduction: This  is hilarious ( link  from a completely deadpan Tyler Cowen).  I’d call it “unintentionally hilarious” but I’m pretty sure that rms knew this was funny when he was writing it.  It’s sort of like when you write a  top 10  list—it’s hard to resist getting silly and going over the top.  It’s only near the end that we get to the bit about the parrots.
 
All joking aside, the most interesting part of the email was this:
  
I [rms] have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every day* doing my usual work, which is responding to email about the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement.
  
I’d wondered for awhile what is it that Richard Stallman actually does, that is how does he spend his time (aside from giving lectures to promote his ideas and pay the bills).

<p>Introduction: Jenny  writes :
  
The Possessed made me [Jenny] think about an interesting workshop-style class I’d like to teach, which would be an undergraduate seminar for students who wanted to find out non-academic ways of writing seriously about literature. The syllabus would include some essays from this book, Geoff Dyer’s Out of Sheer Rage, Jonathan Coe’s Like a Fiery Elephant – and what else?
  
I agree with the commenters that this would be a great class, but . . . I’m confused on the premise.  Isn’t there just a huge, huge amount of excellent serious non-academic writing about literature?  George Orwell, Mark Twain, Bernard Shaw, T. S. Eliot (if you like that sort of thing),  Anthony Burgess , Mary McCarthy (I think you’d call her nonacademic even though she taught the occasional college course),  G. K. Chesterton , etc etc etc?  Teaching a course about  academic  ways of writing seriously about literature would seem much tougher to me.</p><p>5 0.093800388 <a title="1031-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.084490433 <a title="1031-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-04-Discussion_with_Dan_Kahan_on_political_polarization%2C_partisan_information_processing.__And%2C_more_generally%2C_the_role_of_theory_in_empirical_social_science.html">2050 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-04-Discussion with Dan Kahan on political polarization, partisan information processing.

<p>Introduction: Q. D. Leavis wrote:
  
The answer does seem to be that the academic world, like other worlds, is run by the politicians, and sensitively scrupulous people tend to leave politics to other people, while people with genuine work to do certainly have no time as well as no taste for committee-rigging and the associated techniques.  And then of course there are the forces of native stupidity reinforced by that blind hostility to criticism, reform, new ideas and superior ability which is human as well as academic nature.
  
Not that I’ve ever read anything by Mrs. Leavis (or, as the Brits used to write, Mrs Leavis).  The above quote is one of the epigraphs to a book by Richard Kostelanetz.  Whom I’ve never heard of, except in a footnote in John Rodden’s classic Orwell study, The Politics of Literary Reputation.
 
I’ll have more to say about Orwell in another post, but for now let me return to the above Leavis quote, to which I have three reactions:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  interesting article  by Terry Teachout on David Mamet’s political conservatism.  I don’t think of playwrights as gurus, but I do find it interesting to consider the political orientations of  authors  and  celebrities .
 
I have only one problem with Teachout’s thought-provoking article.  He writes:
  
As early as 2002 . . . Arguing that “the Western press [had] embraced antisemitism as the new black,” Mamet drew a sharp contrast between that  trendy  distaste for Jews and the harsh realities of daily life in Israel . . .


In 2006, Mamet published a collection of essays called The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Jewish Self-Hatred and the Jews  that made the point even more bluntly. “The Jewish State,” he wrote, “has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.” He went on to argue that secularized Jews who “reject their birthright of ‘connection to the Divine’” succumb in time to a self-hatred tha</p><p>4 0.78954589 <a title="1031-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-20-We_are_what_we_are_studying.html">1947 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-20-We are what we are studying</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins  writes :
  
When native Australians or New Guineans say that their totemic animals and plants are their kinsmen – that these species are persons like themselves, and that in offering them to others they are giving away part of their own substance – we have to take them seriously, which is to say empirically, if we want to understand the large consequences of these facts for how they organise their lives. The graveyard of ethnographic studies is strewn with the remains of reports which, thanks to anthropologists’ own presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact, were content to ignore or debunk the Amazonian peoples who said that the animals they hunted were their brothers-in-law, the Africans who described the way they systematically killed their kings when they became weak, or the Fijian chiefs who claimed they were gods.
  
My first thought was . . . wait a minute!  Whazzat with “presuppositions as to what constitutes empirical fact”?

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this.

<p>Introduction: Ring Lardner, Jr.:
  
[In 1936] I was already settled in Southern California, and it may have been that first exercise of the franchise that triggered the FBI surveillance of me that would last for decades.  I had assumed, of course, that I was enjoying the vaunted American privilege of the secret ballot.  On a wall outside my polling place on Wilshire Boulevard, however, was a compilation of the district’s registered voters:  Democrats, a long list of names; Republicans, a somewhat lesser number; and “Declines to State,” one, “Ring W. Lardner, Jr.”  The day after the election, alongside those lists were published the results:  Roosevelt, so many; Landon, so many; Browder, one.</p><p>2 0.91226482 <a title="1031-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-NYT_shills_for_personal_DNA_tests.html">543 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-NYT shills for personal DNA tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>3 0.91218728 <a title="1031-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-09-I_was_at_a_meeting_a_couple_months_ago_._._..html">999 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-09-I was at a meeting a couple months ago . . .</a></p>

“grappling”

“workspace” 
“tagging”

<p>Introduction: After blogging on quirky software pioneer  Richard Stallman , I thought it appropriate to write something about recently deceased quirky software pioneer John McCarthy, who, with the exception of being bearded, seems like he was the personal and political opposite of Stallman.
 
 Here’s  a page I found of  Stallman  McCarthy quotes (compiled by Neil Craig).  It’s a mixture of the reasonable and the unreasonable (ok, I suppose the same could be said of this blog!).
 
I wonder if he and Stallman ever met and, if so, whether they had an extended conversation.  It would be like matter and anti-matter! 
   
P.S.  I flipped through McCarthy’s pages and found one of my pet peeves.  See item 3  here , which sounds so plausible but is in fact  not true  (at least, not according to the National Election Study).  As McCarthy’s Stanford colleague Mo Fiorina can tell you, otherwise well-informed people believe all sorts of things about polarization that aren’t so.  Labeling groups of Americans as “</p><p>5 0.86643195 <a title="1031-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-17-More_on_the_difficulty_of_%E2%80%9Cpreaching_what_you_practice%E2%80%9D.html">1325 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-17-More on the difficulty of “preaching what you practice”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>6 0.86515188 <a title="1031-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-Censoring_on_one_end%2C_%E2%80%9Coutliers%E2%80%9D_on_the_other%2C_what_can_we_do_with_the_middle%3F.html">791 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-Censoring on one end, “outliers” on the other, what can we do with the middle?</a></p>

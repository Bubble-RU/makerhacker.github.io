<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>3 0.16365501 <a title="1074-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-18-Question_on_Type_M_errors.html">963 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-18-Question on Type M errors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We recently considered a pair of studies that came out awhile ago involving children and political orientation: Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely to support left-wing parties, compared to parents of boys. And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys.
 
As I  discussed  the other day, the latest version of the Conley and Raucher study came with some incoherent evolutionary theorizing.  There was also some discussion regarding the differences between the two studies.
 
Oswald sent me some relevant comments:
  
It will be hard in cross-sections like the GSS to solve the problem of endogeneity bias. Conservative families may want to have boys, and may use that as a stopping rule.  If so, they will end up with disproportionately large number of girls.

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reacted  (see further discussion in comments  here ) to a recent study on early childhood intervention, in which researchers Paul Gertler, James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Arianna Zanolini, Christel Vermeerch, Susan Walker, Susan M. Chang, and Sally Grantham-McGregor estimated that a particular intervention on young children had raised incomes on young adults by 42%.  I wrote:
  
Major decisions on education policy can turn on the statistical interpretation of small, idiosyncratic data sets — in this case, a study of 129 Jamaican children. . . . Overall, I have no reason to doubt the direction of the effect, namely, that psychosocial stimulation should be good. But I’m skeptical of the claim that income differed by 42%, due to the reason of  the statistical significance filter . In section 2.3, the authors are doing lots of hypothesizing based on some comparisons being statistically significant and others being non-significant.

The concept of M-type error is completely new to all other members of the group (on which I am in my second week) and I was given the job of finding a suitable ref to explain</p><p>5 0.73851621 <a title="1074-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-17-How_to_think_about_the_statistical_evidence_when_the_statistical_evidence_can%E2%80%99t_be_conclusive%3F.html">2174 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-17-How to think about the statistical evidence when the statistical evidence can’t be conclusive?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>6 0.73717552 <a title="1074-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-12-More_frustrations_trying_to_replicate_an_analysis_published_in_a_reputable_journal.html">1054 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-12-More frustrations trying to replicate an analysis published in a reputable journal</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.

<p>Introduction: Andy Cooper writes:
  
A link to an  article , “Four Assumptions Of Multiple Regression That Researchers Should Always Test”, has been making  the rounds  on Twitter.  Their first rule is “Variables are Normally distributed.”  And they seem to be talking about the independent variables – but then later bring in tests on the residuals (while admitting that the normally-distributed error assumption is a weak assumption).  


I thought we had long-since moved away from transforming our independent variables to make them normally distributed for statistical reasons (as opposed to standardizing them for interpretability, etc.)  Am I missing something?  I agree that leverage in a influence is important, but normality of the variables? The article is from 2002, so it might be dated, but given the popularity of the tweet, I thought I’d ask your opinion.
  
My response:  There’s some useful advice on that page but overall I think the advice was dated even in 2002.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll [yes, I've learned how to smoothly do this using alt-o] gives  some writing advice :
  
What gives a text presence is our commitment to asserting facts. We have to face the possibility that we may be wrong about them resolutely, and we do this by writing about them as though we are right.
  
This and an earlier  remark  by Basbøll are closely related in my mind to predictive model checking and to  Bayesian statistics :  we make strong assumptions and then engage the data and the assumptions in a dialogue:  assumptions + data -> inference, and we can then compare the inference to the data which can reveal problems with our model (or problems with the data, but that’s really problems with the model too, in this case problems with the model for the data).
 
I like the idea that a condition for a story to be useful is that we put some belief into it.  (One doesn’t put belief into a joke.)

<p>Introduction: Much-honored playwright Tony Kushner was set to receive one more honor–a degree from John Jay College–but it was suddenly  taken away  from him on an 11-1 vote of the trustees  of the City University of New York.  This was the first rejection of an honorary degree nomination since 1961.
 
The news article focuses on one trustee, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment adviser and onetime political aide, who opposed Kushner’s honorary degree, but to me the relevant point is that the committee as a whole voted 11-1 to ding him.
 
Kusnher said, “I’m sickened,” he added, “that this is happening in New York City. Shocked, really.”  I can see why he’s shocked, but perhaps it’s not so surprising that it’s happening in NYC.  Recall the famous incident from 1940 in which Bertrand Russell was invited and then uninvited to teach at City College.  The problem that time was Russell’s views on free love (as they called it back then).  There seems to be a long tradition of city college officials being will</p><p>5 0.96914536 <a title="1074-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-14-I_hate_to_get_all_Gerd_Gigerenzer_on_you_here%2C_but_._._..html">1319 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-14-I hate to get all Gerd Gigerenzer on you here, but . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor points me to an  opinion piece  by psychologist Reid Hastie, “Our Gift for Good Stories Blinds Us to the Truth.”
 
I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.  That could be fine—after all, Hastie is a distinguished psychology researcher—but I wasn’t so clear that he’s so clear on what he’s saying.  For example:

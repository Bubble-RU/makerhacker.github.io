I [Tassone] had to Google “ Mary Rosh ” but remember that imbroglio now. Made my day, too.


But really I wanted to write to ask you about something related to Bill James. I first encountered his works at age 13, when a baseball coach talked up his books and lent me one (that I fear I never returned). I then read his Abstracts from ’84 or ’85 until they went away, and then some of his other books in the ’90s. Anyway, my question is: Do you know if these works are available on a CD or DVD-ROM or the web something, like they do sometimes w/ collections like Mad Magazine or the New Yorker cartoons or whatever? Maybe through his website, to which I do not subscribe? (By the way, Google Books produces search results for the ’83-’87 editions, but at most just little clippings, not the full book or anything.)


I wonder why we don’t see more of this, since the marginal cost of re-packaging and distributing already-created content for which there is at least some pent</p><p>4 0.15313503 <a title="499-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-05-A_statistician_rereads_Bill_James.html">697 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-05-A statistician rereads Bill James</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.  Then I sent him some reflections on the great Bill James and  he published it !  If anybody out there knows Bill James, please send this on to him:  I have some questions at the end that I’m curious about.
 
Here’s how it begins:
  
 
I read my first Bill James book in 1984, took my first statistics class in 1985, and began graduate study in statistics the next year. Besides giving me the opportunity to study with the best applied statistician of the late 20th century (Don Rubin) and the best theoretical statistician of the early 21st (Xiao-Li Meng), going to graduate school at Harvard in 1986 gave me the opportunity to sit in a basement room one evening that</p><p>5 0.15130644 <a title="499-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-20-5_books_book.html">1222 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-20-5 books book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

<p>Introduction: I used to think that fiction is about making up stories, but in recent years I’ve decided that fiction is really more of a method of telling true stories.  One thing fiction allows you to do is explore what-if scenarios.  I recently read two books that made me think about this:  The Counterlife by Philip Roth and Things We Didn’t See Coming by Steven Amsterdam.  Both books are explicitly about contingencies and possibilities:  Roth’s tells a sequence of related but contradictory stories involving his Philip Roth-like (of course) protagonist, and Amsterdam’s is based on an alternative present/future.  (I picture Amsterdam’s book as being set in Australia, but maybe I’m just imagining this based on my knowledge that the book was written and published in that country.)  I found both books fascinating, partly because of the characters’ voices but especially because they both seemed to exemplify George Box’s dictum that to understand a system you have to perturb it.

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

<p>Introduction: Geen Tomko asks:
  
Can you recommend a good introductory book for statistical computation? Mostly, something that would help make it easier in collecting and analyzing data from student test scores.
  
I don’t know.  Usually, when people ask for a starter statistics book, my recommendation (beyond my own books) is The Statistical Sleuth.  But that’s not really a computation book.  ARM isn’t really a statistical computation book either.  But the statistical computation books that I’ve seen don’t seems so relevant for the analyses that Tomko is looking for.  For example, the R book of Venables and Ripley focuses on nonparametric statistics, which is fine but seems a bit esoteric for these purposes.
 
Does anyone have any suggestions?</p><p>5 0.76278561 <a title="499-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-18-Fiction_is_not_for_tirades%3F__Tell_that_to_Saul_Bellow%21.html">285 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-18-Fiction is not for tirades?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>2 0.96953821 <a title="499-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel_modeling_and_instrumental_variables.html">1468 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-24-Multilevel modeling and instrumental variables</a></p>

I was wondering if multilevel models can be used as an alternative to 2SLS or IV models to deal with (i) endogeneity and (ii) selection problems.


More concretely, I am trying to assess the impact of investment treaties on foreign investment. Aside from the fact that foreign investment is correlated over time, it may be the case that countries that already receive sufficient amounts of foreign investment need not sign treaties, and countries that sign treaties are those that need foreign investment in the first place. Countries thus “select” into treatment; treaty signing is non-random. As such, I argue that to properly estimate the impact of treaties on investment, we must model the determinants of treaty signing.


I [Teo] am currently modeling this as two separate models: (1) regress predictors on likelihood of treaty signing, (2) regress treaty (with interactions, etc) on investment (I’ve thought of using propensity score matching for this part of the model)</p><p>3 0.96875715 <a title="499-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-16-Greenland_is_one_tough_town.html">1677 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-16-Greenland is one tough town</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>4 0.96217382 <a title="499-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-14-GPstuff%3A_Bayesian_Modeling_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">1856 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-14-GPstuff: Bayesian Modeling with Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.
 
Jarno Vanhatalo, Jaakko Riihimäki, Jouni Hartikainen, Pasi Jylänki, Ville Tolvanen, and Aki Vehtari  write :
  
The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

<p>Introduction: J. Robert Lennon  writes :
  
At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest.

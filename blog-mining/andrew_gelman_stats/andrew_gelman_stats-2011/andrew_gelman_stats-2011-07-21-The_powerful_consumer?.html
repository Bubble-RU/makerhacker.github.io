This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Jeff Lax sends along  this  good catch from Ben Somberg, who noticed  this  from Washington Post writer Lori Montgomery:
  
If Congress doesn’t provide additional stimulus spending, economists inside and outside the administration warn that the nation risks a prolonged period of high unemployment or, more frightening, a descent back into recession. But a competing threat — the exploding federal budget deficit — seems to be resonating more powerfully in Congress and among voters.
  
Somberg is skeptical, though, at least of the part about “resonating among voters.”  He finds that in four out of five recent polls, people are much more concerned about jobs than about the deficit:
  
 
A Pew Research / National Journal poll from early June asked “Which of the following national economic issues worries you most?” Number one was “job situation” with 41%. “Federal budget deficit” got 23%.

<p>Introduction: Given Grandma Mankiw’s hypothetical  distaste  for Sonia Sotomayor’s spending habits (recall that Grandma “would have been shocked and appalled” by the judge’s lack of savings), I expect she (the grandmother) would be even more irritated by the success of Sotomayor’s recent book:
 
  
 
Now that Sotomayor has a ton of money coming in,  in addition to  a well-paying job and pension for life, that would almost seem to validate Sotomayor’s foolish, foolish decision to enjoy herself in middle age rather than sock hundreds of thousands of dollars into a retirement account she likely would never touch during her lifetime.
 
One interesting thing about this example is that Mankiw apparently holds within himself a descriptive and normative view of economics.  Descriptively, he models people as “spenders” or “savers.”  But, normatively, he seems to attribute higher values to the “savers.”  (He also seems to be confused about the relation between saving to intertemporal preference (see my long p</p><p>6 0.1329013 <a title="814-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Frank Newport of Gallup  reports  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Americans become progressively less positive about economic conditions the farther away from home they look. Forty-nine percent rate economic conditions in their local area as excellent or good, but that drops to 25% when rating the U.S. economy, and to 13% when assessing the world as a whole.
  
This is really wack:
 
   
 
I can see how it might make sense for Americans to think conditions are worse in other countries, but it’s hard to see a rational reason for the Lake-Wobegon-like pattern of people thinking things are ok locally but not nationally.
 
Gallup highlights the partisan breakdown, which I graphed here:
 
   
 
Unsurprisingly (given that their party controls the presidency and one house of Congress), Democrats are more optimistic than Republicans.  This is just the flip side of University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan claiming in October 2008 that the economy is not that bad because “the current unem</p><p>4 0.79302543 <a title="814-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Economic_policy_does_not_occur_in_a_political_vacuum.html">1936 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Economic policy does not occur in a political vacuum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this.

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I wrote about the importance of demographics in  political trends . Today I’d like to show you how demographics help predict financial crises.
 
Here are a few examples of countries with major crises.
  
 
 
 The working-age population in Japan  peaked in the 1995 census . 
  The 1995 Financial Crisis in Japan  
 
 
 
 
  The working-age USA population growth slows down to unprecedented levels in 2008 (see figure below) 

 

  Financial crisis of 2007-2010 . (Also, notice previous dips in 2001, 1991 and 1981, and consider the  list of recessions .) 
 
 
  China’s working-age population, age 15 to 64, has grown continuously. The labor pool will  peak in 2015  and then decline.  
  
There are more charts in  Demography and Growth  report by the Reserve Bank of Australia:

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: Economist David Backus  writes :
  
A casual reader of economic news can’t help but get the impression  that the way to get the economy moving is to have people spend more — consume more, in the language of macroeconomics.  Seems obvious, doesn’t it?  At the risk of making the obvious complicated, I’d say  it’s not so obvious.  It’s also not obvious that consumption has gone down since the crisis, or that saving has gone up.  So what’s going on with the labor market?
  
I’ll get to the rest of the explanation, but first some background.  The other day, I posted  posted  this remark from Backus: 
  
  
 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics. The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money. But how do we know it’s not the reverse: that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well. As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true</p><p>3 0.93670464 <a title="814-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).

<p>Introduction: By “free energy” I don’t mean perpetual motion machines, cars that run on water and get 200 mpg, or the latest cold-fusion hype.
 
No, I’m referring to the term from physics.  The free energy of a system is, roughly, the amount of energy that can be directly extracted from it.  For example, a rock at room temperature is just  full  of energy—not just the energy locked in its nuclei, but basic thermal energy—but at room temperature you can’t extract any of it.
 
To the physicists in the audience:  Yes, I realize that free energy has a technical meaning in statistical mechanics and that my above definition is sloppy.  Please bear with me.  And, to the non-physicists:  feel free to head to Wikipedia or a physics textbook for a more careful treatment.
 
I was thinking about free energy the other day when hearing someone on the radio say something about China bailing out the E.U.  I did a double-take.  Huh?  The E.U. is rich, China’s not so rich.  How can a middle-income country bail out a</p><p>6 0.92660487 <a title="814-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-21-Handbook_of_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo.html">674 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-21-Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a></p>

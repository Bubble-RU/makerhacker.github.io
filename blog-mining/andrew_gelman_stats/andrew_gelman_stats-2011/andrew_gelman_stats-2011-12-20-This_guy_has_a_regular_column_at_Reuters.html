</p><p>7 I will publicly offer Easterbrook a bet, conditional on Gingrich getting the nomination, that Obama receives between 50% and 55% of the two-party vote. [sent-21, score-0.151]
</p><p>8 My bet is based on Easterbrook’s implicit odds of infinity to 1. [sent-22, score-0.211]
</p><p>9 To keep it simple, I’ll set up the bet as follows:  if Gingrich gets the nomination and Obama receives between 50% and 55% of the vote, Easterbrook gives me $1000. [sent-23, score-0.559]
</p><p>10 If Gingrich gets the nomination and Obama receives more than 55% or less than 50% of the vote, I give Easterbrook $0. [sent-24, score-0.39]
</p><p>11 To clarify why I wasted my time writing about this:  Political reporting is important, and I have every reason to believe it affects how people think about politics. [sent-32, score-0.143]
</p><p>12 A bit of innumeracy in reporting is perhaps unavoidable—after all, Easterbrook is a journalist, not a scientist—but I still like to do my part and point out the gross innumeracies I happen to come across. [sent-33, score-0.101]
</p><p>13 Also, Easterbrook is an interesting target because he’s a political centrist (I guess I’d characterize him as slightly center-left in the U. [sent-34, score-0.107]
</p><p>14 political spectrum), so it’s harder to imagine his errors arising from simple bias. [sent-36, score-0.06]
</p><p>15 And, no, I don’t think that Easterbrook was simply stating in a dramatic way that he thinks that Obama would have a 90% chance of beating Gingrich. [sent-41, score-0.368]
</p><p>16 For one thing, the terms “flaming wreckage in electoral terms” and “wipe the floor” suggest a non-close election. [sent-42, score-0.261]
</p><p>17 ”  Finally, Easterbrook writes, “If I am Barack Obama, I want to run against Mitt Romney,” thus implying that Obama’s chance of winning against Romney is  more  than 90%. [sent-44, score-0.166]
</p><p>18 But Easterbrook doesn’t have to bet me on this one—he can go straight to Intrade, which  currently  has Romney with a 33% chance of being elected president in 2012,  unconditional  on the results of the Republican nomination. [sent-46, score-0.418]
</p><p>19 (Earlier, Easterbrook implies that running against Gingrich would “maximize [Obama's] chance of a huge victory,” while running against Romney would “minimize his chance of a stinging defeat. [sent-47, score-0.43]
</p><p>20 ”  Put the numbers together and you get that Easterbrook thinks that Obama’s chance of beating Romney is greater than his chance of beating Gingrich, thus more than 90%. [sent-48, score-0.676]

<p>Introduction: I don’t know when I’ve seen political writing quote so misinformed as this. It’s a bizarre mixture of cliches, non-sequitors, and outright mistakes.
 
The author is Gregg Easterbrook and he’s writing for  Reuters .
 
First, the cliches:
  
Right now Romney seems to be the frontrunner, which, of course, is a mixed blessing. His aura of experience and reasonableness could prove quite appealing to voters. Perry continues to have the potential to light a populist fire. . . . Of all the 2012 candidates, Huntsman is the one who is Not Just Another Politician.
  
And now the errors.
  
At this point in the 1992 election cycle, the elder George Bush held an 89 percent approval rating. . . . Clinton beat a popular incumbent with a fantastic approval rating. For the 2012 election, Barack Obama is just as vulnerable as the elder Bush, if not even more so. Obama currently has an approval rating of 23 percent.
  
This is all fine, except that:

<p>Introduction: After I recently  criticized  Gregg Easterbrook for assigning Obama an implausible 90+% chance of beating Mitt Romney, some commenters thought I was being too critical, that I should cut Easterbrook some slack because he just was speaking metaphorically.
 
In other words, Easterbrook is a “qual.”  He uses numbers in his writing because that’s what everyone is supposed to do nowadays, but he doesn’t intend those numbers to be meant literally.  Similarly, he presumably didn’t really mean it when he  wrote  that Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren “couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.”  And he had no problem  typing  that Obama’s approval rating was 23% because, to him, “23%” is just another word for “low.”
 
He’s a qual, that’s all.
 
Similarly, when Samantha Power was just being a qual when she wrote the meaningful-sounding but actually empty statement, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican pres</p><p>4 0.26156873 <a title="1075-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-Giving_credit_where_due.html">1830 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-Giving credit where due</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gregg Easterbrook may not  always  be on the ball, but I 100% endorse the last section of his recent  column  (scroll down to “Absurd Specificity Watch”).

<p>Introduction: Dear Reuters editor:
 
Thanks for reading  my blog  and correcting the erroneous numbers in Easterbrook’s  column  from the other day.
 
I’m pretty sure you got the corrections from my blog because in your corrections you used  the exact same links  that I posted.  I think your readers will like that you gave links to the sources of your numbers.
 
But I’d appreciate if you cite me!  It’s considered polite to credit your sources rather than just copying over numbers and links with no mention of where they came from.  Unlike Easterbrook, I’m not expecting to be paid for this material but I’d still like to be thanked.
 
(See the last paragraph of  this post  by Felix Salmon for more on the desirability of linking to your sources.)
 
Also, since you’re correcting the article anyway, maybe you could go back and change this sentence too:
  
But don’t sell Huntsman short because he is low in the polls – Obama had been at that point, too.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had. There’s a  nice sor</p><p>3 0.84620494 <a title="1075-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-14-The_most_clueless_political_column_ever%E2%80%94I_think_this_Easterbrook_dude_has_the_journalistic_equivalent_of_%E2%80%9Ctenure%E2%80%9D.html">959 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-14-The most clueless political column ever—I think this Easterbrook dude has the journalistic equivalent of “tenure”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I recently  wrote  about the difficulty people have with probabilities, in this case the probability that Obama wins the election. If the probability is reported as 70%, people think Obama is going to win.  Actually, though, it just means that Obama is predicted to get about 50.8% of the two-party vote, with an uncertainty of something like 2 percentage points.  So, as I wrote, the election really is too close to call in the sense that the predicted vote margin is less than its uncertainty.
 
But . . . when people see a number such as 70%, they tend to attribute too much certainty to it.  Especially when the estimated probability has increased from, say 60%.  How to get the point across?  Commenter HS  had  what seems like a good suggestion:
  
Say that Obama will win, but there is 25% chance (or whatever) that this prediction is wrong? Same point, just slightly different framing, but somehow, this seems far less incendiary.
  
I like that.  Somehow a stated probability of 75% sounds a</p><p>5 0.80402267 <a title="1075-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-01-Recently_in_the_sister_blogs%3A__special_pre-election_edition%21.html">1556 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-01-Recently in the sister blogs:  special pre-election edition!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gregg Easterbrook :
  
Gingrich is a wild card. He probably would end up a flaming wreckage in electoral terms, but there’s a chance he could become seen as the man unafraid to bring sweeping change to an ossified Washington, D.C. There’s perhaps a 90 percent likelihood Obama would wipe the floor with Gingrich, versus a 10 percent likelihood Gingrich would stage an historic upset.
  
This is the dumbest thing I’ve seen since . . . ummm, I dunno, how bout  this ?  It actually gets worse because Easterbrook then invokes game theory.  What next?  Catastrophe theory?  Intelligent design?
 
P.S.  Maybe I should explain for readers without an education in probability theory.  Let’s suppose “wipe the floor” means that Obama gets 55%+ of the two-party vote, and let’s suppose that “an historic upset” means that Obama gets less than 50% of the vote.  Now try to draw a forecast distribution that has 90% of its probability above 0.55 and 10% of it’s probability below 0.50.  It’s a pretty weird-loo</p><p>2 0.90226769 <a title="1075-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-09-Dennis_the_dentist%2C_debunked%3F.html">565 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-09-Dennis the dentist, debunked?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Devah Pager points me to  this article  by Uri Simonsohn, which begins:
  
Three articles published [by Brett Pelham et al.] have shown that a disproportionate share of people choose spouses, places to live, and occupations with names similar to their own. These findings, interpreted as evidence of implicit egotism, are included in most modern social psychology textbooks and many university courses. The current article successfully replicates the original findings but shows that they are most likely caused by a combination of cohort, geographic, and ethnic confounds as well as reverse causality.
  
From Simonsohn’s article, here’s a handy summary of the claims and the evidence (click on it to enlarge):

<p>Introduction: James Druckman and Jeremy Freese write: 
  
  
We are pleased to announce that Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was renewed for another round of funding by NSF starting last Fall. TESS allows researchers to submit proposals for experiments to be conducted on a nationally-representative, probability-based Internet platform, and successful proposals are fielded at no cost to investigators.  More information about how TESS works and how to submit proposals is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org.


Additionally, we are pleased to announce the development of two new proposal mechanisms. TESS’s Short Studies Program (SSP) is accepting proposals for fielding very brief population-based survey experiments on a general population of at least 2000 adults. SSP recruits participants from within the U.S. using the same Internet-based platform as other TESS studies. More information about SSP and proposal requirements is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org/ssp.</p><p>5 0.890468 <a title="1075-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-18-Faculty_who_don%E2%80%99t_like_teaching_and_hate_working_with_students.html">1068 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-18-Faculty who don’t like teaching and hate working with students</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  links  to Steve Hsu  linking  to a 1977  interview  by Katherine Sopka of physics professor Sidney Coleman.
 
I don’t know anything about Coleman’s research but the interview caught my eye because one of my roommates in grad school was one of Coleman’s advisees.
 
Anyway, here’s the key bit from the interview:
  
Sopka:  But you do enjoy working with students or do you?


Coleman:  No. I hate it. You do it as part of the job. Well, that’s of course false…or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. Occasionally there’s a student who is a joy to work with. But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students…


Sopka:  I guess your remark means then that you would like to avoid teaching undergraduate courses or even required graduate courses…


Coleman:  Or even special topics courses. Teaching is unpleasant work. No question about it. It has its rewards. One feels happy about having a job well done.

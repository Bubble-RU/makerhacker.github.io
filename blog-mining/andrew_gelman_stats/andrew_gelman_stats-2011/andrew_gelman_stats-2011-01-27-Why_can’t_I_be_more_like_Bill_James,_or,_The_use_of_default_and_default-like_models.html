</p><p>7 The problem–besides the inherent inflexibility of a linear model with no interactions–is that Palmer seemed chained to it. [sent-10, score-0.359]
</p><p>8 When the model gave silly results, Palmer just kept with it. [sent-11, score-0.275]
</p><p>9 Still and all, my impression is that Palmer was locked into his regression models and that it hurt his sportswriting. [sent-16, score-0.186]
</p><p>10 Bill James had a comment once about some analysis of Palmer that gave players negative values in the declining years of their careers. [sent-17, score-0.221]
</p><p>11 Whenever he came up to bat with men on base, it was always a relief to see him strike out, as that meant that he’d avoided hitting into a double play. [sent-20, score-0.288]
</p><p>12 )   Bill James did not limit himself to linear models. [sent-21, score-0.185]
</p><p>13 I use linear regression  a lot , to the extent that a couple of my colleagues once characterized my work on toxicology as being linear modeling. [sent-25, score-0.625]
</p><p>14 True, these were two of my stupider colleagues (and that’s saying a lot), but the fact that a couple of Ph. [sent-26, score-0.129]
</p><p>15 ’s could confuse a nonlinear differential equation with a linear regression does give some sense of statisticians’ insensitivity to functional forms. [sent-28, score-0.252]
</p><p>16 Right now, I get around the constraints of linearity and additivity by adding interaction after interaction after interaction. [sent-32, score-0.271]
</p><p>17 That’s fine, but perhaps a bit of thoughtful model construction would be a useful supplement to my usual brute-force approach. [sent-33, score-0.164]
</p><p>18 , but, near the end of the Baseball Abstract period, my impression was that James started to mix in more and more unsupported opinions, for example in 1988 characterizing Phil Bradley as possibly the best player in baseball. [sent-38, score-0.208]
</p><p>19 That’s fine–I’m no baseball expert, and maybe Phil Bradley really was one of the top players of 1987, or maybe he’s a really nice guy and Bill James wanted to help him out, or maybe James was just kidding on that one. [sent-39, score-0.43]
</p><p>20 My guess (based on a lot of things in the last couple of Baseball Abstracts, not just that Phil Bradley article)  is simply that James had been right on so many things where others had been wrong that he started to trust his hunches without backing them up with statistical analysis.

<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.  Then I sent him some reflections on the great Bill James and  he published it !  If anybody out there knows Bill James, please send this on to him:  I have some questions at the end that I’m curious about.
 
Here’s how it begins:
  
 
I read my first Bill James book in 1984, took my first statistics class in 1985, and began graduate study in statistics the next year. Besides giving me the opportunity to study with the best applied statistician of the late 20th century (Don Rubin) and the best theoretical statistician of the early 21st (Xiao-Li Meng), going to graduate school at Harvard in 1986 gave me the opportunity to sit in a basement room one evening that</p><p>3 0.31151766 <a title="541-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-17-%E2%80%9CFaith_means_belief_in_something_concerning_which_doubt_is_theoretically_possible.%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%94_William_James.html">1419 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-17-“Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.” — William James</a></p>

I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.

But even the Master is not perfect.  Here he is, in the context of the all-time 20th-greatest shortstop (in his reckoning):
  
Are athletes special people?  In general, no, but occasionally, yes.  Johnny Pesky at 75 was trim, youthful, optimistic, and practically exploding with energy.  You rarely meet anybody like that who  isn’t  an ex-athlete–and that makes athletes seem special. [italics in the original]
  
Hey, I’ve met 75-year-olds like that–and none of them are ex-athletes!  That’s probably because I don’t know a lot of ex-athletes.  But Bill James . . . he knows a lot of athletes.  He went to the bathroom with Tim Raines once!  The most I can say is that I saw Rickey Henderson steal a couple bases when he was playing against the Orioles once.

Are athletes special people?  In general, no, but occasionally, yes.  Johnny Pesky at 75 was trim, youthful, optimistic, and practically exploding with energy.  You rarely meet anybody like that who  isn’t  an ex-athlete–and that makes athletes seem special. [italics in the original]
  
Hey, I’ve met 75-year-olds like that–and none of them are ex-athletes!  That’s probably because I don’t know a lot of ex-athletes.  But Bill James . . . he knows a lot of athletes.  He went to the bathroom with Tim Raines once!  The most I can say is that I saw Rickey Henderson steal a couple bases when he was playing against the Orioles once.

I suspect we’re going to take years to work the kinks out of overall rating systems.


By way of analogy, Bill James kicked off the modern era of baseball statistics analysis around 1975. But he stuck to doing smaller scale analyses and avoided trying to build one giant overall model for rating players. In contrast, other analysts such as Pete Palmer rushed into building overall ranking systems, such as his 1984 book, but they tended to generate curious results such as the greatness of Roy Smalley Jr.. James held off until 1999 before unveiling his win share model for overall rankings.
  
I remember looking at Pete Palmer’s book many years ago and being disappointed that he did everything through his Linear Weights formula. A hit is worth X, a walk is worth Y, etc.  Some of this is good–it’s presumably an improvement on counting walks as 0 or 1 hits, also an improvement on counting doubles and triples a</p><p>2 0.92589116 <a title="541-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-05-Question_26_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1367 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-05-Question 26 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reported  on someone who wanted to insert text links into the blog.  I asked her how much they would pay and got no answer.
 
Yesterday, though, I received this reply:
  
Hello Andrew,


I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I’d like to make a proposal for your site. Please refer below.


We would like to place a simple text link ad on page http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/  to link to *** with the key phrase ***.


We will incorporate the key phrase into a sentence so it would read well. Rest assured it won’t sound obnoxious or advertorial. We will then process the final text link code as soon as you agree to our proposal. 


We can offer you $200 for this with the assumption that you will keep the link “live” on that page for 12 months or longer if you prefer.


Please get back to us with a quick reply on your thoughts on this and include your Paypal ID for payment process.  Hoping for a positive response from you.

<p>Introduction: I love  this stuff :
  
This article presents a simulation-based method designed to establish the computational correctness of software developed to fit a specific Bayesian model, capitalizing on properties of Bayesian posterior distributions. We illustrate the validation technique with two examples. The validation method is shown to find errors in software when they exist and, moreover, the validation output can be informative about the nature and location of such errors. We also compare our method with that of an earlier approach.

I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.

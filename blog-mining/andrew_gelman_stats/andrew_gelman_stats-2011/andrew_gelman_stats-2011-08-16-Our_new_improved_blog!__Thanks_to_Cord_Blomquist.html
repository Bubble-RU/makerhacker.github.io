You may have noticed changes in the appearance of the blog.   Cord Blomquist  moved us over to this new WordPress blog.  He earlier did it for our sister blog and he can do it for you too, for a reasonable fee.  We had a few hitches in getting all the files and links and comments working, and Cord was with us all the way to straighten things out.  Thanks, Cord!  You did a great job and we’re happy to recommend you to others.
 
P.S.  The last thing we got working was the RSS feed.  So if you’ve been reading the blog on RSS, you have about 3 weeks of backlog you can catch up on.
 
P.P.S.  We’re still playing a bit with the blog’s formatting.

<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.
  
I recommend it (and, no, Cord is not paying m</p><p>3 0.32239795 <a title="856-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-16-RSS_mess.html">91 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-16-RSS mess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Apparently some of our new blog entries are appearing as old entries on the RSS feed, meaning that those of you who read the blog using RSS may be missing a lot of good stuff.  We’re working on this.  But, in the meantime, I recommend you click on  the blog itself  to see what’s been posted in the last few weeks.

<p>Introduction: We had some security problem:  not an actual virus or anything, but a potential leak which caused Google to blacklist us.   Cord  fixed us and now weâ&euro;&trade;re fine.  Good job, Google!  Better to find the potential problem  before  there is any harm!</p><p>5 0.16381124 <a title="856-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-28-Writing_for_free.html">2080 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-28-Writing for free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.
  
I’m lucky enough not to ever have had to bale hay or go door-to-door for a living, but I find writing to be enjoyable!  So I can see how it can be hard for Kreider to compete wi</p><p>6 0.1594058 <a title="856-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-14-5_books_on_essentialism%21.html">905 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-14-5 books on essentialism!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There is sometimes a line of news, a thought or an article sufficiently aligned with the general topics on this blog that is worth sharing. 
 
I could have emailed it to a few friends who are interested. Or I could have gone through the relative hassle of opening up the blog administration interface, cleaned it up a little, added some thoughts and made it pretty to post on the blog. And then itâ&euro;&trade;s poring through hundreds of spam messages, just to find two or three false positives in a thousand spams. Or, finding the links, ideas and comments reproduced on another blog without attribution or credit. Or, even, finding the whole blog mirrored on another website.
 
It might seem all work and no fun, but what keeps me coming back is your comments: the discussions, the additional links, information and insights you provide, this is what makes it all worthwhile. 
 
Thanks, those of you who are commenters! And let us know what would make your life easier.</p><p>4 0.78763425 <a title="856-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-14-5_books_on_essentialism%21.html">905 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-14-5 books on essentialism!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi all.  You may have noticed changes in the appearance of the blog.   Cord Blomquist  moved us over to this new WordPress blog.  He earlier did it for our sister blog and he can do it for you too, for a reasonable fee.  We had a few hitches in getting all the files and links and comments working, and Cord was with us all the way to straighten things out.  Thanks, Cord!  You did a great job and we’re happy to recommend you to others.
 
P.S.  The last thing we got working was the RSS feed.  So if you’ve been reading the blog on RSS, you have about 3 weeks of backlog you can catch up on.
 
P.P.S.  We’re still playing a bit with the blog’s formatting.  Feel free to put any formatting suggestions in the comments.</p><p>2 0.87038755 <a title="856-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-10-Translating_into_Votes%3A_The_Electoral_Impact_of_Spanish-Language_Ballots.html">406 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-10-Translating into Votes: The Electoral Impact of Spanish-Language Ballots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Hopkins sends along  this article :
  
[Hopkins] uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the turnout and election impacts of Spanish-language assistance provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Analyses of two different data sets – the Latino National Survey and California 1998 primary election returns – show that Spanish-language assistance increased turnout for citizens who speak little English. The California results also demonstrate that election procedures an influence outcomes, as support for ending bilingual education dropped markedly in heavily Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with Spanish-language assistance. The California analyses find hints of backlash among non-Hispanic white precincts, but not with the same size or certainty. Small changes in election procedures can influence who votes as well as what wins.
  
Beyond the direct relevance of these results, I find this paper interesting as an example of research that is fundamentally quantitative.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson  write :
  
Financial crises are staggeringly costly. Only major wars rival them in the burdens they place on public finances. Taxpayers typically transfer enormous resources to banks, their stockholders, and creditors, while public debt explodes and the economy runs below full employment for years. This paper compares how relatively large, developed countries have handled bailouts over time. It analyzes why some have done better than others at containing costs and protecting taxpayers. The paper argues that political variables – the nature of competition within party systems and voting turnout – help explain why some countries do more than others to limit the moral hazards of bailouts.
  
I know next to nothing about this topic, so I’ll just recommend you click through and read the article yourself.  Here’s a bit more:
  
Many recent papers have analyzed financial crises using large data bases filled with cases from all over the world.

<p>Introduction: The second best thing about  this story  (from Tom Scocca) is that Anderson spells “Tweets” with a capital T.
 
But the best thing is that Scocca is numerate—he compares numbers on the logarithmic scale:
  
Reminding Lake that he only had 169 Twitter followers was the saddest gambit of all. Jon Lee Anderson has 17,866 followers. And Kim Kardashian has, as I write this, 17,489,892 followers. That is: Jon Lee Anderson is 1/1,000 as important on Twitter, by his own standard, as Kim Kardashian. He is 10 times closer to Mitch Lake than he is to Kim Kardashian.
  
How often do we see a popular journalist who understands orders of magnitude?  Good job, Tom Scocca!
 
P.S.  Based on his “little twerp” comment, I also wonder if Anderson suffers from tall person syndrome—that’s the problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.  Don’t get me wrong—I have lots of tall friends who are complete</p><p>5 0.8281135 <a title="856-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-21-Job_openings_at_conservative_political_analytics_firm%21.html">1909 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-21-Job openings at conservative political analytics firm!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After posting that  announcement  about Civis Analytics, I wrote, “If a reconstituted Romney Analytics team is hiring, let me know and I’ll post that ad too.”  Adam Schaeffer  obliged :
  

Not sure about Romney’s team, but  Evolving Strategies  is looking for sharp folks who lean right:


Evolving Strategies is a political communications research firm specializing in randomized controlled experiments in the “lab” and in the “field.” ES is bringing a scientific revolution to free-market/conservative politics.


We are looking for people who are obsessive about getting things right and creative in their work. A ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the academic literature in their field, highly developed skills, a commitment to academic rigor, but an intuitive understanding of practical political concerns and objectives as well.


We’re looking for new talent to help with our fast-growing portfolio in these areas:

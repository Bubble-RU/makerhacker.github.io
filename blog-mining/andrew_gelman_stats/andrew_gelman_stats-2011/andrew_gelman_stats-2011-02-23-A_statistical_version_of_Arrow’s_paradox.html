<p>Introduction: Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics.  At the end of this post are three figures from Chapter 1 of Bayesian Data Analysis illustrating empirical evaluation of forecasts.
 
But first the background.  Why am I bringing this up now?  It’s because of something Larry Wasserman  wrote the other day : 
  
  
One of the striking facts about [baseball/political forecaster Nate Silver's recent] book is the emphasis the Silver places on frequency calibration. . . . Have no doubt about it: Nate Silver is a frequentist. For example, he says:

 
One of the most important tests of a forecast — I would argue that it is the single most important one — is called calibration. Out of all the times you said there was a 40 percent chance of rain, how often did rain actually occur? If over the long run, it really did rain about 40 percent of the time, that means your forecasts were well calibrated.

<p>Introduction: Larry Wasserman, a leading theoretical statistician and generally thoughtful guy, has started  a blog  on . . . theoretical statistics!  Good stuff, and readers of this blog should enjoy the different perspective that Larry offers.
 
 Here  are some earlier references to Larry on this blog, and  here’s  a discussion that gives a sense of our different (but not extremely different) attitudes about statistical methods.</p><p>4 0.15775597 <a title="586-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-13-Philosophy_of_Bayesian_statistics%3A__my_reactions_to_Wasserman.html">1165 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-13-Philosophy of Bayesian statistics:  my reactions to Wasserman</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Larry Wasserman, “Low Assumptions, High Dimensions”:
 
This article was refreshing to me because it was so different from anything I’ve seen before.  Larry works in a statistics department and I work in a statistics department but there’s so little overlap in what we do.  Larry and I both work in high dimesions (maybe his dimensions are higher than mine, but a few thousand dimensions seems like a lot to me!), but there the similarity ends.  His article is all about using few to no assumptions, while I use assumptions all the time.  Here’s an example.  Larry writes:
  
P. Laurie Davies (and his co-workers) have written several interesting papers where probability models, at least in the sense that we usually use them, are eliminated. Data are treated as deterministic.

I have a hopefully quick question about Multilevel Models . . . While being Bayesian would make the attached question [having to do with calculating confidence intervals for linear combinations of fixed and varying coefficents] moot, and I am certainly sympathetic in my own work, I am looking to understand the Frequentist perspective as I need to explain how to do this in R to people without experience in WinBUGS and who are generally uninterested in gaining such experience.
 

 
My reply:
 
This sort of thing happens to me all the time, which is one reason I try to do these inferences using simulations, so I donâ&euro;&trade;t have to keep track of covariances.  The simulation-based Bayes inferences can be interpreted as classical freq inferences; to put it another way, the Bayesian inference can be thought of as a computational trick to work with the multivariate normal and t distributions that arise in classical confidence intervals.</p><p>4 0.7244525 <a title="586-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_like_this_cartoon.html">1572 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-10-I don’t like this cartoon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some people pointed me to  this :
 
 
 
I am happy to see statistical theory and methods be a topic in popular culture, and of course I’m glad that, contra  Feller , the Bayesian is presented as the hero this time, but . . . . I think the lower-left panel of the cartoon unfairly misrepresents frequentist statisticians.
 
Frequentist statisticians recognize many statistical goals.  Point estimates trade off bias and variance.  Interval estimates have the goal of achieving nominal coverage and the goal of being informative.  Tests have the goals of calibration and power.  Frequentists know that no single principle applies in all settings, and this is a setting where this particular method is clearly inappropriate.  All statisticians use prior information in their statistical analysis.  Non-Bayesians express their prior information not through a probability distribution on parameters but rather through their choice of methods.  I think this non-Bayesian attitude is too restrictive, but in</p><p>5 0.70648128 <a title="586-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Yes%2C_checking_calibration_of_probability_forecasts_is_part_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">1610 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Yes, checking calibration of probability forecasts is part of Bayesian statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, when we deal with scientists, statisticians are often put in a setting reminiscent of Arrow’s paradox, where we are asked to provide estimates that are informative and unbiased and confidence statements that are correct conditional on the data and also on the underlying true parameter. [It's not generally possible for an estimate to do all these things at the same time -- ed.]  Larry Wasserman feels that scientists are truly frequentist, and Don Rubin has told me how he feels that scientists interpret all statistical estimates Bayesianly. I have no doubt that both Larry and Don are correct. Voters want lower taxes and more services, and scientists want both Bayesian and frequency coverage; as the saying goes, everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.</p><p>2 0.95751196 <a title="586-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-28-50_shades_of_gray%3A__A_research_story.html">1959 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-28-50 shades of gray:  A research story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a killer story  (from Brian Nosek, Jeffrey Spies, and Matt Motyl).
 
Part 1:
  
Two of the present authors, Motyl and Nosek, share interests in political ideology. We were inspired by the fast growing literature on embodiment that demonstrates surprising links between body and mind (Markman & Brendl, 2005; Proffitt, 2006) to investigate embodiment of political extremism. Participants from the political left, right and center (N = 1,979) completed a perceptual judgment task in which words were presented in different shades of gray. Participants had to click along a gradient representing grays from near black to near white to select a shade that matched the shade of the word. We calculated accuracy: How close to the actual shade did participants get? The results were stunning. Moderates perceived the shades of gray more accurately than extremists on the left and right (p = .01). Our conclusion: political extremists perceive the world in black-and-white, figuratively and literally</p><p>3 0.95525181 <a title="586-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine. The Holiday Inn testing facility was the largest in North America, and had been operating for nearly ten years before inspecto</p><p>4 0.9551686 <a title="586-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-09-Plaig.html">1755 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-09-Plaig</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This , from Jeremy Duns (previously encountered  here ), resonates with me:
  
When I asked Thayer why he hadn’t cited Zeigler, he told me very forcefully that he had cited  everything , and accused me of libelling him: this means, presumably, that he accused me of libel without checking his article and seeing the ‘citations’ weren’t there. And when he did finally spot that, why did he not tell me I was right, apologize, get them added and explain to me, on his site, below the article or anywhere else that his editor had accidentally missed out his attributions?
  
It’s so frustrating.  The kind of people who cheat also seem to be the kind of people who lie when caught at it, and the kind of people who  never ever apologize .</p><p>5 0.95275426 <a title="586-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Clarity_on_my_email_policy.html">503 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Clarity on my email policy</a></p>

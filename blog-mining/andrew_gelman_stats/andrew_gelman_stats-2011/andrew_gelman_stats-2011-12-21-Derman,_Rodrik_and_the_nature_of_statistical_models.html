<p>Introduction: Econometrician and statistician Dale Poirier writes:
  
24 years ago (1988, Journal of Economics Perspectives) I [Poirier] noted cognitive dissonance among some economists who treat the agents in their theoretical framework as Bayesians, but then analyze the data (even in the same paper!) as a frequentist. Recently, I have found similar cases in cognitive science. I suspect other disciplines exhibit such behavior. Do you know of any examples in political science?
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know of any such examples in political science.  Game theoretic models are popular in poli sci, but I haven’t seen much in the way of models of Bayesian decision making.
 
Here are two references (not in political science) that might be helpful.
 
1.  I have  argued  that the utility model (popular in economics and political science as a way of providing “microfoundations” for analyses of aggregate behavior) is actually more of a bit of folk-psychology that should not be taken seriously.

Fast learning algorithms for discovering the hidden structure in data


Daniel Hsu, Microsoft Research


11am, Wednesday April 10th, Interschool lab, 7th floor CEPSR, Columbia University


A major challenge in machine learning is to reliably and automatically discover hidden structure in data with minimal human intervention.  For instance, one may be interested in understanding the stratification of a population into subgroups, the thematic make-up of a collection of documents, or the dynamical process governing a complex time series.  Many of the core statistical estimation problems for these applications are, in general, provably intractable for both computational and statistical reasons; and therefore progress is made by shifting the focus to realistic instances that rule out the intractable cases.  In this talk, I’ll describe a general computational approach for correctly estimating a wide class of statistical mod</p><p>4 0.10855792 <a title="1076-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-26-Occam.html">1392 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-26-Occam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cosma Shalizi  and  Larry Wasserman  discuss some papers from a conference on Ockham’s Razor.  I don’t have anything new to add on this so let me link to  past blog entries  on the topic and repost the following  from 2004 :
  
A lot has been written in statistics about “parsimony”—that is, the desire to explain phenomena using fewer parameters–but I’ve never seen any good general justification for parsimony.  (I don’t count “Occam’s Razor,” or “Ockham’s Razor,” or whatever, as a justification.  You gotta do better than digging up a 700-year-old quote.)


Maybe it’s because I work in social science, but my feeling is:  if you can approximate reality with just a few parameters, fine.  If you can use more parameters to fold in more information, that’s even better.


In practice, I often use simple models—because they are less effort to fit and, especially, to understand.  But I don’t kid myself that they’re better than more complicated efforts!


My favorite quote on this comes from  Rad</p><p>5 0.10340634 <a title="1076-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-23-When_are_complicated_models_helpful_in_psychology_research_and_when_are_they_overkill%3F.html">1690 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-23-When are complicated models helpful in psychology research and when are they overkill?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nick Brown is bothered by  this article , “An unscented Kalman filter approach to the estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems models,” by Sy-Miin Chow, Emilio Ferrer, and John Nesselroade.  The introduction of the article cites a bunch of articles in serious psych/statistics journals.  The question is, are such advanced statistical techniques really needed, or even legitimate, with the kind of very rough data that is usually available in psych applications? Or is it just fishing in the hope of discovering patterns that are not really there?
 
I wrote:
 
It seems like a pretty innocuous literature review.  I agree that many of the applications are silly (for example, they cite the work of the notorious  John Gottman  in fitting a predator-prey model to spousal relations (!)), but overall they just seem to be presenting very standard ideas for the mathematical-psychology audience.  It’s not clear whether advanced techniques are always appropriate here, but they come in through a natura</p><p>6 0.096652724 <a title="1076-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-26-Infoviz_on_top_of_stat_graphic_on_top_of_spreadsheet.html">2186 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-26-Infoviz on top of stat graphic on top of spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi writes the above in a  discussion  of a misunderstanding of the economics of Keynes.
 
The discussion is interesting.  According to Sethi, Keynes wrote that, in a depression, nominal wages might be sticky but in any case a decline in wages would not do the trick to increase hiring.  But many modern economics writers have missed this. For example, Gary Becker writes, “Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in the downward direction. . . . A fall in price stimulates demand and reduces supply until they are brought back to rough equality.”  Whether Becker is empirically correct is another story, but in any case he is misinterpreting Keynes.
 
But the actual reason I’m posting here is in reaction to Sethi’s remark quoted in the title above, in which he endorses a 1975 paper by James Tobin on wages and employment but remarks that Tobin’s paper did not include the individual-level de</p><p>3 0.68051195 <a title="1076-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-08-The_politics_of_economic_and_statistical_models.html">1204 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-08-The politics of economic and statistical models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on  our recent discussion  of the problems of considering utility theory as a foundation for economic analysis (which in turn was a reprise of  this post  from last September), somebody named Mark  pointed  me to a 2007 article by Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden, “The road not taken:  How psychology was removed from economics, and how it might be brought back,” which begins:
  
This article explores parallels between the debate prompted by Pareto’s reformulation of choice theory at the beginning of the twentieth century and current controversies about the status of behavioural economics. Before Pareto’s reformulation, neoclassical economics was based on theoretical and experimental psychology, as behavioural economics now is. Current discovered preference defences of rational-choice theory echo arguments made by Pareto. Both treat economics as a separate science of rational choice, independent of psychology. Both confront two fundamental problems: to find a defensible defi</p><p>4 0.67894137 <a title="1076-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-18-Not_as_ugly_as_you_look.html">1174 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-18-Not as ugly as you look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>6 0.66107506 <a title="1076-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-06-Some_economists_are_skeptical_about_microfoundations.html">1200 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-06-Some economists are skeptical about microfoundations</a></p>

We noticed that the important topic of association measures and tests  came up again  in your blog, and we have few comments in this regard.


It is useful to distinguish between the univariate and multivariate methods. A consistent multivariate method can recognise dependence between two vectors of random variables, while a univariate method can only loop over pairs of components and check for dependency between them.


There are very few consistent multivariate methods. To the best of our  knowledge there are three practical methods:


1) HSIC by Gretton et al. (http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/papers/GreBouSmoSch05.pdf)


2) dcov by Szekely et al. (http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1267453933)


3) A method we introduced in Heller et al (Biometrika, 2013, 503—510, http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/04/biomet.ass070.full.pdf+html, and an R package, HHG, is available as well http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HHG/index.html).

Xiao-Li Meng  recommended shrinking weights by taking them to a fractional power (such as square root) instead of trimming the extremes. 
 
Rod Little  combined design-based and model-based survey inference. 
 
Michael Elliott  used mixture models for complex survey design.

Why Development Economics Needs Theory






There is no general agreement on how much we should rely on economic theory in motivating empirical work and whether we should try to formulate and estimate “structural parameters.” I (Acemoglu) argue that the answer is largely “yes” because otherwise econometric estimates would lack external validity, in which case they can neither inform us about whether a particular model or theory is a useful approximation to reality, nor would they be useful in providing us guidance on what the effects of similar shocks and policies would be in different circumstances or if implemented in different scales. I therefore define “structural parameters” as those that provide external validity and would thus be useful in testing theories or in policy analysis beyond the specific environment and sample from which they are derived. External validity becomes a particularly challenging t</p><p>same-blog 4 0.93124282 <a title="1076-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-21-Derman%2C_Rodrik_and_the_nature_of_statistical_models.html">1076 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-21-Derman, Rodrik and the nature of statistical models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  thoughts  from Kaiser Fung.
 
Derman seems to have a point in his criticisms of economic models—and things are just as bad in other social sciences.  (I’ve  criticized  economists and political scientists for taking a crude, 80-year-old model of psychology as “foundational,” but even more sophisticated models in psychology and sociology have a lot of holes, if you go outside of certain clearly bounded areas such as psychometrics.)
 
What can be done, then?  One approach, which appeals to me as a statistician, is to more carefully define one’s range of inquiry.  Even if we don’t have a great model of political bargaining, we can still use ideal-point models to capture a lot of the variation in legislative voting.  And, in my blog post linked to above, I recommended that economists forget about coming up with the grand unified theory of human behavior (pretty impossible, given that they still don’t want to let go of much of their folk-psychology models) and put more effort i</p><p>5 0.92531687 <a title="1076-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-26-Further_thoughts_on_nonparametric_correlation_measures.html">1230 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-26-Further thoughts on nonparametric correlation measures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Malka Gorfine, Ruth Heller, and Yair Heller write a comment on the paper of Reshef et al. that we  discussed  a few months ago.
 
Just to remind you what’s going on here, here’s my quick summary from December:
  
Reshef et al. propose a new nonlinear R-squared-like measure.


Unlike R-squared, this new method depends on a tuning parameter that controls the level of discretization, in a “How long is the coast of Britain” sort of way. The dependence on scale is inevitable for such a general method. Just consider: if you sample 1000 points from the unit bivariate normal distribution, (x,y) ~ N(0,I), you’ll be able to fit them perfectly by a 999-degree polynomial fit to the data. So the scale of the fit matters.


The clever idea of the paper is that, instead of going for an absolute measure (which, as we’ve seen, will be scale-dependent), they focus on the problem of summarizing the grid of pairwise dependences in a large set of variables. As they put it: “Imagine a data set with hundreds</p><p>6 0.92319208 <a title="1076-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-John_McAfee_is_a_Heinlein_hero.html">1616 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-John McAfee is a Heinlein hero</a></p>

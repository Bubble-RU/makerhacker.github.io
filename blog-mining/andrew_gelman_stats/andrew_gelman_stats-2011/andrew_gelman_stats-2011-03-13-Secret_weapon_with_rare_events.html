I’ve been playing around with data from Coursera transaction logs, for an economics course and a modern poetry course so far.


For the Modern Poetry course, where there’s quite a bit of activity in the forums, the instructor (Al Filreis) is interested in what the factors are that lead to discussion threads being longer or shorter. For example, he wonders whether his own (fairly frequent) interventions have the effect of prolonging discussion or cutting it off.


Some background explorations are  here  with the relevant stuff mostly at the end, including  this .


With respect to Al’s specific question, my thought was to look at each of his comments, each one being the nth in some sequence, and to look at the empirical probability of continuing (at all, or perhaps for at least 1,2,3,… additional turns) in those cases c</p><p>4 0.15725452 <a title="610-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-05-Can_we_make_better_graphs_of_global_temperature_history%3F.html">2319 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-05-Can we make better graphs of global temperature history?</a></p>

Some editors at Wikipedia have made an attempt to produce a complete record for the Phanerozoic:


     But these collations are imperfect in many ways. On the last figure the time axis is a rather confusing mix of linear segments and logarithmic scaling, there is no calibration during overlap periods, and the scaling and baselining of the individual, differently sourced data is a little ad hoc. Wikipedia has figures for other time periods that have not been updated in years and treatment of uncertainties is haphazard (many originally from  GlobalWarmingArt ).


I think this could all be done better. However, creating good graphics takes time and some skill, especially when the sources of data are so disparate. So this might be usefully done using some crowd-sourcing . . .

<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who wishes to remain anonymous:
  
My colleague and I are trying to understand the best way to approach a problem involving measuring a group of individuals’ abilities across time, and are hoping you can offer some guidance.


We are trying to analyze the combined effect of two distinct groups of people (A and B, with no overlap between A and B) who collaborate to produce a binary outcome, using a mixed logistic regression along the lines of the following.


Outcome ~ (1 | A) + (1 | B) + Other variables


What we’re interested in testing was whether the observed A random effects in period  1 are predictive of the A random effects in the following period 2.  Our idea being create two models, each using a different period’s worth of data, to create two sets of A coefficients, then observe the relationship between the two.  If the A’s have a persistent ability across periods, the coefficients should be correlated or show a linear-ish relationshi</p><p>6 0.10069853 <a title="610-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-10-My_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1311 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-10-My final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A colleague recently sent me a copy of some articles on the estimation of treatment interactions (a topic that’s interested me for awhile).  One of the articles, which appeared in the Lancet in 2000, was called “ Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials ,” by Susan F. Assmann, Stuart J. Pocock, Laura E. Enos, and Linda E. Kasten. . . . 
 
Hey, wait a minute–I know Susan Assmann!  Well, I sort of know her.  When I was a freshman in college, I asked my adviser, who was an applied math prof, if I could do some research.  He connected me to Susan, who was one of his Ph.D. students, and she gave me a tiny part of her thesis to work on.
 
The problem went as follows.  You have a function f(x), for x going from 0 to infinity, that is defined as follows.  Between 0 and 1, f(x)=x.  Then, for x higher than 1, f’(x) = f(x) – f(x-1).  The goal is to figure out what f(x) does.  I think I’m getting this right here, but I might be getting confused on some of the detai</p><p>3 0.72778273 <a title="610-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-08-%E2%80%9CWhat_do_you_think_about_curved_lines_connecting_discrete_data-points%3F%E2%80%9D.html">134 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-08-“What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

Also, I just added options to the main matlab function (vwregress.m) to make it display the spaghetti plot (similar to what Lucas did, but a simple bootstrap) and the shaded CI that you suggested (see figs below). They’re good suggestions.


   


   


Personally, I [Hsiang] like the shaded CI better, since I think that all the visual activity in the spaghetti plot is a little distracting and sometimes adds visual weight in places where I wouldn’t want it.  But the option is there in case people like it.

I just thought of this small adjustment to your filled CI idea that seems neat. Cartographers like map projections that conserve area.

I’m working on a paper examining the effect of superpower alliance on a binary DV (war). I hypothesize that the size of the effect is much higher during the Cold War than it is afterwards. I’m going to run a Chow test to check whether this effect differs significantly between 1960-1989 and 1990-2007 (Scott Long also has a method using predicted probabilities), but I’d also like to show the trend graphically, and thought that your “Secret Weapon” would be useful here. I wonder if there is anything I should be concerned about when doing this with a (rare-events) logistic regression. I was thinking to graph the coefficients in 5-year periods, moving a single year at a time (1960-64, 1961-65, 1962-66, and so on), reporting the coefficient in the graph for the middle year of each 5-year range).

I don’t know nuthin bout no Chow test but, sure, I’d think the secret weapon would work.

<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  asked  what happened to Matthew Klam, a talented writer who has a bizarrely professional-looking webpage but didn’t seem to be writing anymore.
 
Good news!  He published  a new story  in the New Yorker!  Confusingly, he wrote it under the name “Justin Taylor,” but I’m not fooled (any more than I was fooled when that posthumous Updike story was published under the name “ Antonya Nelson “).  I’m glad to see that Klam is back in action and look forward to seeing some stories under his own name as well.</p><p>5 0.94190168 <a title="610-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-28-Matching_for_preprocessing_data_for_causal_inference.html">375 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-28-Matching for preprocessing data for causal inference</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Blattman  writes :
  
Matching is not an identification strategy a solution to your endogeneity problem; it is a weighting scheme. Saying matching will reduce endogeneity bias is like saying that the best way to get thin is to weigh yourself in kilos. The statement makes no sense. It confuses technique with substance. . . . When you run a regression, you control for the X you can observe. When you match, you are simply matching based on those same X. . . .
  
I see what Chris is getting at–matching, like regression, won’t help for the variables you’re not controlling for–but I disagree with his characterization of matching as a weighting scheme.  I see matching as a way to restrict your analysis to comparable cases.  The statistical motivation:  robustness.  If you had a good enough model, you wouldn’t neet to match, you’d just fit the model to the data.  But in common practice we often use simple regression models and so it can be helpful to do some matching first before regress</p><p>6 0.94136006 <a title="610-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-17-Clutering_and_variance_components.html">417 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-17-Clutering and variance components</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ashok Rao  shreds  the latest book from Niall Ferguson, who we’ve  encountered  most recently as the source of homophobic slurs but who used to be a  serious scholar . Or maybe still is. Remember Linda, that character from the Kahneman and Tversky vignette who was deemed likely to be “a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement”? Maybe Ferguson is a serious scholar who is active in the being-a-hack movement. Perhaps when he’s  not  writing books where he distorts his sources, or giving lectures with unfortunate slurs, he’s doing historical research. It’s certainly possible.
 
Rao describes how Ferguson distorts his source materials.  This is a no-no for any historian, of course, but not such a surprise for Ferguson, who crossed over the  John Yoo line  awhile ago.
 
Last year I wrote about the paradox of influence:  Ferguson gets and keeps the big-money audience by telling them not what he (Ferguson) wants to say—not by giving them his unique insights and understanding—but rat</p><p>3 0.27897412 <a title="1034-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-12-Niall_Ferguson%2C_the_John_Yoo_line%2C_and_the_paradox_of_influence.html">1493 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-12-Niall Ferguson, the John Yoo line, and the paradox of influence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Life is continuous but we think in discrete terms.  In applied statistics there’s the p=.05 line which tells us whether a finding is significant or not.  Baseball has the Mendoza line.
 
And academia has what might be called the  John Yoo line :  the point at which nothing you write gets taken seriously, and so you might as well become a hack because you have no scholarly reputation remaining.
 
John Yoo, of course, became a hack because, I assume, he had nothing left to lose.  In contrast, historian Niall Ferguson has reportedly been moved to  hackery  because he has so much to  gain .  At least that is the  analysis  of Stephen Marche ( link  from Basbøll):
  
Ferguson’s critics have simply misunderstood for whom Ferguson was writing that piece. They imagine that he is working as a professor or as a journalist, and that his standards slipped below those of academia or the media. Neither is right. Look at his speaking agent’s Web site.

<p>Introduction: We had some interesting comments on our recent  reflections  on Niall Ferguson’s ill-chosen remarks in which he attributed Keynes’s economic views (I don’t actually know exactly what Keyesianism is, but I think a key part is for the government to run surpluses during economic booms and deficits during recessions) to the Keynes being gay and marrying a ballerina and talking about poetry.  The general idea, I think, is that people without kids don’t care so much about the future, and this motivated Keynes’s party-all-the-time attitude, which might have worked just fine for Eddie Murphy’s girlfriend in the 1980s and in San Francisco bathhouses of the 1970s but, according to Ferguson, is not the ticket for preserving today’s American empire.

<p>Introduction: History professor (or, as the news reports call him, “Harvard historian”) Niall Ferguson got in trouble when speaking at a conference of financial advisors.  Tom Kostigen  reports : 
  
  
Ferguson responded to a question about Keynes’ famous philosophy of self-interest versus the economic philosophy of Edmund Burke, who believed there was a social contract among the living, as well as the dead. Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had. He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of “poetry” rather than procreated. . . . Ferguson . . . says it’s only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an “effete” member of society. . . .


Throughout his remarks, Ferguson referred to his “friends” in high places. They should all be embarrassed and ashamed of such a connection to such small-minded thinking. Ferguson says U.S. laws and institutions have become degenerate.

<p>Introduction: In  our discussion  of historian Niall Ferguson and piss-poor monocausal social science, commenter Matt W. pointed to Ferguson’s listing at a speakers bureau.  One of his talks is entitled “Is This the Chinese Century?”  The question mark at the end seems to give him some wiggle room.
 
I give some paid lectures myself and was curious to learn more about this organization, World Class Speakers and Entertainers, so I clicked through to  this list of topics  and then searched for Statistics.  Amazingly enough, there was a “Statistician” category (right above “Story Teller / Lore / Art / Power of Story Telling,” “Strategist / Strategies / Strategic Planning,” and “Success”).
 
There I found  Gopal C. Dorai, Ph.D. , who offers insights such as “vegetarians usually will not eat meat products, no matter how hungry they feel.”  And “Cheating or lying for the sake of obtaining favorable treatment from others will be anathema to some people.”  And “Life is a one-way-street; we cannot turn the c</p><p>2 0.83101487 <a title="1034-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-Huh%3F.html">1915 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-Huh?</a></p>

Regular blog readers know all about this topic.  ( Here  are the slides.)  But, rest assured, I donâ&euro;&trade;t just mock. I also offer constructive suggestions.
 
My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.

<p>Introduction: Michael Collins ( here’s  a link but I don’t know the original source) picked up on  my article  about statistics and the cigarette companies, which mentioned a consulting job of famed Stanford statistician Ingram Olkin, and noticed that Olkin was recently in the news as a coauthor of a report on organic food:
  
A widely publicized study claiming that there is no demonstrated difference in nutritional value between organically and conventionally grown foods just appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Broad mainstream media coverage produced headlines like Stanford Scientists Cast Doubt on Advantages of Organic Meat and Produce. The media failed to mention one point that may be of major interest. . . . The article co-author with recognized expertise in meta-analysis, Ingram Olkin, applied for a grant from Council of Tobacco Research (CTR) in 1976. . . . Olkin applied to the CTR to conduct a project on the statistical methods used in the Framingham Heart Study, the landmark projec</p><p>5 0.80644917 <a title="1034-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-16-A_poll_that_throws_away_data%3F%3F%3F.html">1940 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-16-A poll that throws away data???</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Blumenthal writes: 
  
  
What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW.

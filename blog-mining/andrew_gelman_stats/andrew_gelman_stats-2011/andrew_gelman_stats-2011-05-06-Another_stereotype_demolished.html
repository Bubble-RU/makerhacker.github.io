<p>Introduction: I’ve heard all sorts of scare stories of what it’s like to speak in an academic economics seminar:  they’re rude, they interrupt constantly, they don’t let you get through three slides in an hour, etc.  But whenever I’ve actually spoke in an economics department, the people have been polite and well-behaved, really it’s been like any other seminar. 
   
I mentioned this to some people awhile ago and they said that the nasty-economist thing only happens in the top departments.  I’d spoken at Columbia (which, if not at the very top, is still respectable), but that was in the political economy seminar and I’m a political scientist, so maybe they were nice to me because I’m local.  And the other econ departments where I’d spoken were in Europe (maybe they’re nicer there) or at non-elite institutions in the U.S.  So I called my friend at Harvard econ, told him my story, and asked if I could speak there.  He duly booked me for the Harvard-MIT econometrics seminar.
 
I  spoke  at the seminar,</p><p>3 0.11974355 <a title="699-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-04-%E2%80%9CTo_find_out_what_happens_when_you_change_something%2C_it_is_necessary_to_change_it.%E2%80%9D.html">186 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-04-“To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the classic Box, Hunter, and Hunter book.  The point of the saying is pretty clear, I think:  There are things you learn from perturbing a system that you’ll never find out from any amount of passive observation.  This is not always true–sometimes “nature” does the experiment for you–but I think it represents an important insight.
 
I’m currently writing (yet another) review article on causal inference and am planning use this quote.
 
P.S.  I find it helpful to write these reviews for a similar reason that I like to blog on certain topics over and over, each time going a bit further (I hope) than the time before.  Beyond the benefit of communicating my recommendations to new audiences, writing these sorts of reviews gives me an excuse to explore my thoughts in more rigor.
 
P.P.S.  In the original version of this blog entry, I correctly attributed the quote to Box but I incorrectly remembered it as “No understanding without manipulation.”  Karl Broman (see comment below) gave me</p><p>4 0.10855214 <a title="699-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-Just_gave_a_talk.html">2275 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-Just gave a talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>5 0.10749201 <a title="699-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-25-Quantitative_Methods_in_the_Social_Sciences_M.A.%3A_Innovative%2C_interdisciplinary_social_science_research_program_for_a_data-rich_world.html">591 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-25-Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences M.A.: Innovative, interdisciplinary social science research program for a data-rich world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 12 years ago Greg Wawro, Sy Spilerman, and I started a M.A. program here in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences, jointly between the departments of history, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and statistics.  We created a bunch of new features for the program, including an interdisciplinary course based on  this book .
  

 
And here’s their new logo:
 
 
 
Don’t blame me for the pie-chart motif!  Seriously, though, the program is great.  I’m proud to have gotten it started, and I’m impressed by the progress that Chris Weiss and others have made in expanding the program during the past decade.</p><p>6 0.10552205 <a title="699-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.
 
It would take very little effort to adapt this graph-laden a</p><p>3 0.78373206 <a title="699-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-My_talk_midtown_this_Friday_noon_%28and_at_Columbia_Monday_afternoon%29.html">1821 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-My talk midtown this Friday noon (and at Columbia Monday afternoon)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue (between 34th and 35th street), room 6002.  The topic:   causality and statistical learning .  Announcement is  here  (scroll down).  It says that if you would like to attend any event, please respond by emailing datamining@gc.cuny.edu
 
I’m also giving a shorter talk on the same topic in the Sustainable Development Seminar  Series  4pm Monday 29 Apr in room 407 International Affairs Bldg (at 118th St. and Amsterdam Ave.).
 
It’s just a coincidence that I’m giving the same talk twice.  I was asked at different times to speak for these groups.  When someone asks me to speak, I let them pick from recent talks on the  list .</p><p>4 0.78324866 <a title="699-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-A_graphics_talk_with_no_visuals%21.html">1598 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-A graphics talk with no visuals!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So, I’m at MIT, twenty minutes into my  talk  on tradeoffs in information graphics to the computer scientists, when the power goes out.  They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.  It went well, perhaps better than the actual talk would’ve gone, even though they didn’t get to see most of my  slides .</p><p>5 0.75596988 <a title="699-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-20-Not_quite_getting_the_point.html">1073 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-20-Not quite getting the point</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.  But still.</p><p>5 0.88992453 <a title="699-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-It_depends_upon_what_the_meaning_of_the_word_%E2%80%9Cfirm%E2%80%9D_is..html">940 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-It depends upon what the meaning of the word “firm” is.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>6 0.88939065 <a title="699-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-How_to_think_about_Lou_Dobbs.html">335 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-How to think about Lou Dobbs</a></p>

Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: In my comments on  academic cheating , I briefly discussed the question of how some of these papers could’ve been published in the first place, given that they tend to be of low quality.  (It’s rare that people plagiarize the good stuff, and, when they do—for example when a senior scholar takes credit for a junior researcher’s contributions without giving proper credit—there’s not always a paper trail, and there can be legitimate differences of opinion about the relative contributions of the participants.)
 
Anyway, to get back to the cases at hand:  how did these rulebreakers get published in the first place?  The question here is not how did they get away with cheating but how is it that top journals were publishing mediocre research? 
   
In the case of the profs who falsified data (Diederik Stapel) or did not follow scientific protocol (Mark Hauser), the answer is clear:  By cheating, they were able to get the sort of too-good-to-be-true results which, if they  were  true, would be</p><p>3 0.25439543 <a title="675-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-Arrow%E2%80%99s_theorem_update.html">883 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-Arrow’s theorem update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this letter  to Bruno Frey from the editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.  ( Background here , also  more here  from Olaf Storbeck.)  The journal editor was upset about Frey’s self-plagiarism, and Frey responded with an apology:
  
It was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable. . . . Please be assured that we take all precautions and measures that this unfortunate event does not happen again, with any journal.
  
What I wonder is:  How “deplorable” does Frey really think this is?  You don’t publish a paper in 5 different places by accident!  Is Frey saying that he knew this was deplorable back then and he did it anyway, based on calculation balancing the gains from multiple publications vs. the potential losses if he got caught?  Or is he saying that the conduct is deplorable, but he didn’t realize it was deplorable when he did it?

Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.

<p>Introduction: In  my remarks  on Arrow’s theorem (the weak form of Arrow’s Theorem is that any result can be published no more than five times. The strong form is that every result will be published five times), I meant no criticism of Bruno Frey, the author of the articles in question:  I agree that it can be a contribution to publish in multiple places.  Regarding the evaluation of contributions, it should be possible to evaluate research contributions and also evaluate communication.  One problem is that communication is both under- and over-counted.  It’s undercounted in that we mostly get credit for original ideas not for exposition; it’s overcounted in that we need communication skills to publish in the top journals.  But I don’t think these two biases cancel out.
 
The real reason I’m bringing this up, though, is because Arrow’s theorem happened to me recently and in interesting way.  Here’s the story.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>5 0.90552062 <a title="675-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-The_importance_of_style_in_academic_writing.html">902 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-The importance of style in academic writing</a></p>

In the case of the profs who falsified data (Diederik Stapel) or did not follow scientific protocol (Mark Hauser), the answer is clear:  By cheating, they were able to get the sort of too-good-to-be-true results which, if they  were  true, would be</p><p>6 0.89219809 <a title="675-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I think  Lawrence Summers  would like this  paper  by James Hansen, Makiko Sato, and Reto Ruedy (link from  Krugman  via  Palko ).  Hansen et al. write:
  
The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations (σ) warmer than climatology. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1% of Earth’s surface in the period of climatology, now typically covers about 10% of the land area.


   
  
The point is that it makes sense to look at the whole distribution, but extreme events provide information also.

There has been some discussion about the recent PISA results (in which the U.S. comes out pretty badly), for example  here  and  here .  The claim being made is that the poor U.S. scores are due to rampant individual- or family-level poverty in the U.S.  They claim that when one controls for poverty, the U.S. comes out on top in the PISA standings, and then they infer that poverty causes poor test scores.  The further inference is then that the U.S. could improve education by the “simple” action of reducing poverty.  Anyway, I was wondering what you thought about their analysis.
  
My reply:  I agree this is interesting and I agree it’s hard to know exactly what to say about these comparisons.  When I’m stuck in this sort of question, I ask, WWJD?  In this case, I think Jennifer would ask what are the potential interventions being considered. Various ideas for changing the school system would perhaps have different effects on different groups of students.</p><p>3 0.96218002 <a title="675-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-29-Postdocs_in_probabilistic_modeling%21__With_David_Blei%21__And_Stan%21.html">1961 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-29-Postdocs in probabilistic modeling!

I have  two postdoc openings for basic research in probabilistic modeling .


The thrusts are (a) scalable inference and (b) model checking.  We 
will be developing new methods and implementing them in probabilistic 
programming systems.  I am open to applicants interested in many kinds 
of applications and from any field.
  
“Scalable inference” means black-box VB and related ideas, and “probabilistic programming systems” means Stan!  (You might be familiar with Stan as an implementation of Nuts for posterior sampling, but Stan is also an efficient program for computing probability densities and their gradients, and as such is an ideal platform for developing scalable implementations of variational inference and related algorithms.)
 
And you know I like model checking.

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok with a good  catch :
  
In  Why Don’t Women Patent? , a recent NBER paper, Jennifer Hunt et al. [Jean-Philippe Garant, Hannah Herman, and David Munroe] present a stark fact: Only 5.5% of the holders of commercialized patents are women. One might think that this is explained by the relative lack of women with science and engineering degrees but Hunt et al. find that “women with such a degree are scarcely more likely to patent than women without.” Instead, most of the difference is “accounted for by differences among those with a science or engineering degree” especially the fact that women are underrepresented in patent-intensive fields such as electrical and mechanical engineering and in development and design.


Predictably, the authors do not ask why women might self-selection into non patent-intensive fields, perhaps because this would require at least a discussion of  politically incorrect questions . The failure to investigate these questions leads to some dubious co</p><p>6 0.95666695 <a title="675-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-09-Thomas_Hobbes_would_be_spinning_in_his_grave.html">1715 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-09-Thomas Hobbes would be spinning in his grave</a></p>

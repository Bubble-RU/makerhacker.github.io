</p><p>8 So it’s not at all “irrational” (let alone “irrationalist”) for them to pursue a strategy which, in Lanchester’s words, “will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn. [sent-14, score-0.832]

</p><p>12 I’m not saying you have to agree with Republican politicians or Tea Party activists here; it just seems silly to describe them as irrational. [sent-20, score-0.163]

<p>Introduction: A Brooks op-ed  in the New York Times (circulation approximately 1.5 million):
  
People at the extremes are happier than political moderates. . . . none, it seems, are happier than the Tea Partiers . . .
  
 Jay Livingston  on his blog (circulation approximately 0 (rounding to the nearest million)), giving data from the 2009-2010 General Social Survey, which is the usual place people turn to for population data on happiness of Americans:
  
   


The GSS does not offer “bitter” or “Tea Party” as choices, but extreme conservatives are nearly three times as likely as others to be “not too happy.”
  
Livingston reports that the sample size for “Extremely Conservative” here is 80.  Thus the standard error for that green bar on the right is approx sqrt(0.3*0.7/80)=0.05.
 
So how could Brooks have made such a mistake?  I can think of two possibilities:
 
1.  Brooks has some other data source that directly addresses the happiness of supporters of the Tea Party movement.

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?

As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.

<p>Introduction: Mark Lilla recalls some recent Barack Obama quotes and then  writes :
  
If this is the way the president and his party think about human psychology, it’s little wonder they’ve taken such a beating.
  
In the spirit of that old line, “That and $4.95 will get you a tall latte,” let me agree with Lilla and attribute the Democrats’ losses in 2010 to the following three factors:
 
1.  A poor understanding of human psychology;
 
2.  The Democrats holding unified control of the presidency and congress with a large majority in both houses (factors that are historically associated with big midterm losses); and
 
3.  A terrible economy.
 
I will let you, the readers, make your best guesses as to the relative importance of factors 1, 2, and 3 above.
 
Don’t get me wrong:  I think psychology is important, as is the history of ideas (the main subject of Lilla’s article), and I’d hope that Obama (and also his colleagues in both parties in congress) can become better acquainted with psychology, moti</p><p>6 0.15132982 <a title="1020-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>5 0.90622771 <a title="1020-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Two_stories_about_the_election_that_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">384 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Two stories about the election that I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko points me to a  news article  by Zack Beauchamp on Jason Richwine, the recent Ph.D. graduate from Harvard’s policy school who left the conservative Heritage Foundation after it came out that his Ph.D. thesis was said to be all  about  the low IQ’s of Hispanic immigrants.  Heritage and  others  apparently thought this association could discredit their anti-immigration-reform position.  Richwine’s mentor Charles Murray was  unhappy  about the whole episode.
 
Beauchamp’s article is worth reading in that it provides some interesting background, in particular by getting into the details of the Ph.D. review process.  In a sense, Beauchamp is too harsh.  Flawed Ph.D. theses get published all the time.  I’d say that  most  Ph.D. theses I’ve seen are flawed:  usually the plan is to get the papers into shape later, when submitting them to journals.  If a student doesn’t go into academia, the thesis typically just sits there and is rarely followed up on.

I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>same-blog 4 0.94873732 <a title="1020-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-20-No_no_no_no_no.html">1020 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-20-No no no no no</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.  The disturbing thing about the whole process wasn’t so much that the Tea Partiers were irrational as that th</p><p>5 0.94211906 <a title="1020-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-04-Data_visualization_panel_at_the_New_York_Public_Library_this_evening%21.html">1246 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-04-Data visualization panel at the New York Public Library this evening!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I hate to keep bumping our scheduled posts but this is just too important and too exciting to wait.  So it’s time to jump the queue.
 
 
 
The news is  a paper from Michael Betancourt  that presents a super-cool new way to compute normalizing constants:
  
A common strategy for inference in complex models is the relaxation of a simple model into the more complex target model, for example the prior into the posterior in Bayesian inference. Existing approaches that attempt to generate such transformations, however, are sensitive to the pathologies of complex distributions and can be difficult to implement in practice. Leveraging the geometry of thermodynamic processes I introduce a principled and robust approach to deforming measures that presents a powerful new tool for inference.
  
The idea is to generalize Hamiltonian Monte Carlo so that it moves through a family of distributions (that is, it transitions through an “inverse temperature” variable called beta that indexes the family) a</p><p>3 0.20189099 <a title="945-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-Some_thoughts_on_academic_cheating%2C_inspired_by_Frey%2C_Wegman%2C_Fischer%2C_Hauser%2C_Stapel.html">901 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-Some thoughts on academic cheating, inspired by Frey, Wegman, Fischer, Hauser, Stapel</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.19007775 <a title="945-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-A_%28not_quite%29_grand_unified_theory_of_plagiarism%2C_as_applied_to_the_Wegman_case.html">728 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-A (not quite) grand unified theory of plagiarism, as applied to the Wegman case</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  news article  by Eli Kintisch with the following wonderful quote:
  
Will Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who questions the consensus view on climate, thinks Mashey is a destructive force who uses “totalitarian tactics”–publishing damaging documents online, without peer review–to carry out personal vendettas.
  
I’ve never thought of uploading files as “totalitarian” but maybe they do things differently at Princeton.  I actually think of totalitarians as acting secretly–denunciations without evidence, midnight arrests, trials in undisclosed locations, and so forth.  Mashey’s practice of putting everything out in the open seems to me the opposite of totalitarian.
 
The article also reports that Edward Wegman’s lawyer said that Wegman “has never engaged in plagiarism.”  If I were the lawyer, I’d be pretty mad at Wegman at this point.  I can just imagine the conversation:

Wikipedia guy:  “No, you added another paragraph at the end and you changed the headline. . . . You even copied the typos that I’ve corrected on my website.  It was taken verbatim and reprinted in your paper.”
 
The original author got a  check  for $500 but, unfortunately, no free subscription to “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics” (a $1400-$2800  value ).
 
P.S.  To those who think I’m being mean to Wegman:  I haven’t yet heard that he’s apologized to the people whose work he copied without attribution, or to the people who spent their time tracking all this down, or to the U.S. Congress for misrepresenting his expertise in his official report.

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>6 0.69572628 <a title="945-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-That_last_satisfaction_at_the_end_of_the_career.html">1568 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-That last satisfaction at the end of the career</a></p>

When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>4 0.94234371 <a title="945-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>same-blog 5 0.93250829 <a title="945-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-06-W%E2%80%99man_%3C_W%E2%80%99pedia%2C_again.html">945 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-06-W’man < W’pedia, again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Deep Climate  looks at  another paper by the 2002 recipient of the American Statistical Association’s Founders award. This time it’s not funny, it’s just sad. 
   
Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero. The allowance for “uphill” moves saves the method from becoming stuck at local minima—which are the bane of greedier methods.
  
And here’s Wegman:
  
During each step of the algorithm, the variable that will eventually represent the minimum is replaced by a random solution that is chosen according to a temperature</p><p>6 0.93189847 <a title="945-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-19-Statistical_discrimination_again.html">1541 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-19-Statistical discrimination again</a></p>

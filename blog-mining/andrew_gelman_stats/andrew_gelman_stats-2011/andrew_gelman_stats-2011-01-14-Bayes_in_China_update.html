<p>Introduction: I received the following in email from our publisher:
  
I write with regards to the project to publish a China Edition of your book “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” (ISBN-13: 9780521686891) for the mainland Chinese market. I regret to inform you that we have been notified by our partner in China, Posts & Telecommunications Press (PTP), that due to various politically sensitive materials in the text, the China Edition has not met with the approval of the publishing authorities in China, and as such PTP will not be able to proceed with the publication of this edition. We will therefore have to cancel plans for the China Edition of your book. Please accept my apologies for this unforeseen development. If you have any queries regarding this, do feel free to let me know.

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes  in the Statistics Forum:
  
The Chinese scientific literature is rarely read or cited outside of China. But the authors of this work are usually knowledgeable of the non-Chinese literature — at least the A-list journals. And so they too try to replicate the alpha finding. But do they? One would think that they would find the same diminished effect size, but they don’t! Instead they replicate the original result, even larger.  Here’s one of the graphs:

<p>Introduction: The scientific consensus  appears to be  that, to the extent that acupuncture makes people feel better, it is through relaxing the patient, also the acupuncturist might help in other ways, encouraging the patient to focus on his or her lifestyle.
 
A friend recommended an acupuncturist to me awhile ago and I told her the above line, to which she replied:  No, I don’t feel at all relaxed when I go to the acupuncturist.  Those needles really hurt!
 
I don’t know anything about this, but one thing I do know is that whenever I discuss the topic with a Chinese friend, they assure me that acupuncture is real.  Real real.  Not “yeah, it works by calming people” real or “patients respond to a doctor who actually cares about them” real.  Real real.  The needles, the special places to put the needles, the whole thing.  I haven’t had a long discussion on this, but my impression is that Chinese people think of acupuncture as working in the same way that we think of TV’s or cars or refrigerators:</p><p>6 0.13847068 <a title="517-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-27-Historian_and_journalist_slug_it_out.html">1030 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-27-Historian and journalist slug it out</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In reply to my  question , David MacKay writes:
  
You said that can imagine rounding up 9 to 10 – which would be elegant if we worked in base 10.


But in the UK we haven’t switched to base 10 yet, we still work in  dozens and grosses.  (One gross = 12^2 = 144.)  So I was taught (by John Skilling, probably) “a dozen samples are plenty”. 


Probably in an earlier draft of the book in 2001 I said “a dozen”, rather than “12″.  Then some feedbacker may have written and said “I don’t know what a dozen is”;  so then I sacrificed elegant language and replaced “dozen” by “12″, which  leads to your mystification. 


PS – please send the winner of your competition a free copy of my other book ( sewtha ) too, from me. 


PPS I see that Mikkel Schmidt [in your comments] has diligently found the correct answer, which I guessed above. I suggest you award the prizes to him.
  
OK, we’re just  giving  away books here!

<p>Introduction: This  post by Jordan Ellenberg (“Stoner represents a certain strain in the mid-century American novel that I really like, and which I don’t think exists in contemporary fiction.  Anguish, verbal restraint, weirdness”) reminds me that what I really like is mid-to-late-twentieth-century  literary criticism .  I read a great book from the 50s, I think it was, by Anthony West (son of Rebecca West and H. G. Wells), who reviewed books for the New Yorker.  It was great, and it made me wish that other collections of his reviews had been published (they hadn’t). I’d also love to read collections of  Alfred Kazin ‘s reviews (there are some collections, but he published many many others that have never been reprinted) and others of that vintage.  I’m pretty sure these hypothetical books wouldn’t sell many copies, though. (I feel lucky, though, that at one point a publisher released a pretty fat collection of  Anthony Burgess ‘s book reviews.) It’s actually scary to think that many many more peopl</p><p>4 0.78652889 <a title="517-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-10-I_guess_they_noticed_that_if_you_take_the_first_word_on_every_seventeenth_page%2C_it_spells_out_%E2%80%9CDeath_to_the_Shah%E2%80%9D.html">510 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-10-I guess they noticed that if you take the first word on every seventeenth page, it spells out “Death to the Shah”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sophie Roell, who interviewed me for  5books  (background  here ), reports that 5books has become a book.  Or, to be precise, that they have released a collection of the 5books interviews as  an ebook .  Interviewees include me, some people I’d never heard of, and a bunch of legitimate bigshots such as Ian McEwen and Steven Pinker.  I’d say it’s fun and often unexpected bathroom reading, but then you’d need a book tablet (a “kindle”?  What do you call these things generically?) in that special room.  But then again, maybe you already do!

<p>Introduction: Someone points me to  this report  from Tilburg University on disgraced psychology researcher Diederik Stapel.  The reports includes bits like this:
  
When the fraud was first discovered, limiting the harm it caused for the victims was a matter of urgency. This was particularly the case for Mr Stapel’s former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers . . . However, the Committees were of the opinion that the main bulk of the work had not yet even started. . . . Journal publications can often leave traces that reach far into and even beyond scientific disciplines. The self-cleansing character of science calls for fraudulent publications to be withdrawn and no longer to proliferate within the literature. In addition, based on their initial impressions, the Committees believed that there were other serious issues within Mr Stapel’s publications . . . This brought into the spotlight a research culture in which this sloppy science, alongside out-and-out fraud, was able to remain undetected</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94712162 <a title="517-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-Bayes_in_China_update.html">517 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-Bayes in China update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>4 0.94265807 <a title="517-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing_hardware.html">214 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing hardware</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lyric Semiconductor   posted:
  

For over 60 years, computers have been based on digital computing principles. Data is represented as bits (0s and 1s). Boolean logic gates perform operations on these bits. A processor steps through many of these operations serially in order to perform a function. However, today’s most interesting problems are not at all suited to this approach.


Here at Lyric Semiconductor, we are redesigning information processing circuits from the ground up to natively process probabilities: from the gate circuits to the processor architecture to the programming language.  As a result, many applications that today require a thousand conventional processors will soon run in just one Lyric processor, providing 1,000x efficiencies in cost, power, and size.

  
 Om Malik  has some more information, also relating to the team and the business.
 
The fundamental idea is that computing architectures work deterministically, even though the world is fundamentally stochastic.</p><p>5 0.93848222 <a title="517-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-09-iPython_Notebook.html">1716 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-09-iPython Notebook</a></p>

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.
  
Cool.  We’ll have to do that ex</p><p>6 0.93622541 <a title="517-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Non-academic_writings_on_literature.html">34 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Non-academic writings on literature</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This , from Jeremy Duns (previously encountered  here ), resonates with me:
  
When I asked Thayer why he hadn’t cited Zeigler, he told me very forcefully that he had cited  everything , and accused me of libelling him: this means, presumably, that he accused me of libel without checking his article and seeing the ‘citations’ weren’t there. And when he did finally spot that, why did he not tell me I was right, apologize, get them added and explain to me, on his site, below the article or anywhere else that his editor had accidentally missed out his attributions?
  
It’s so frustrating.  The kind of people who cheat also seem to be the kind of people who lie when caught at it, and the kind of people who  never ever apologize .</p><p>3 0.081039034 <a title="1033-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-%24.html">1003 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.  I’d like to think that if</p><p>4 0.079281524 <a title="1033-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-The_scope_for_snooping.html">1070 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-The scope for snooping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys sent the following question to David Madigan and me: 
  
  
I am working on a piece on the registration of research designs (to prevent snooping). As part of it we want to give some estimates for the “scope for snooping” and how this can be affected by different registration requirements.


So we want to answer questions of the form: 
“Say in truth there is no relation between x and y, you were willing to mess about with models until you found a significant relation between them, what are the chances that you would succeed if: 
1. You were free to choose the indicators for x and y 
2. You were free to choose h control variable from some group of k possible 
controls 
3. You were free to divide up the sample in k ways to examine heterogeneous treatment effects 
4. You were free to select from some set of k reasonable models”


People have thought a lot about the first problem of choosing your indicators;  we have done a set of simulations to answer the other questions</p><p>5 0.077054136 <a title="1033-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Busted%21.html">221 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Busted!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m just glad that universities don’t  sanction  professors for publishing false theorems.
 
If the guy really is nailed by the feds for fraud, I hope they don’t throw him in prison.  In general, prison time seems like a brutal, expensive, and inefficient way to punish people.  I’d prefer if the government just took 95% of his salary for several years, made him do community service (cleaning equipment at the local sewage treatment plant, perhaps; a lab scientist should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc.  If restriction of this dude’s personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, he could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if he were ever more than 3 miles from his home.  But no need to bill the taxpayers for the cost of keeping him in prison.</p><p>6 0.077021033 <a title="1033-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-18-%E2%80%9CI_was_finding_the_test_so_irritating_and_boring_that_I_just_started_to_click_through_as_fast_as_I_could%E2%80%9D.html">351 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-18-“I was finding the test so irritating and boring that I just started to click through as fast as I could”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nick Rizzo  points  to  this  amusing Gawker item (sorry!) from Hamilton Nolan about advertisers trying to sneak links into blog content.  The Gawker blogger got the following email:
  
Greetings, 
My name is Bryan Clark, and I’m a big fan of your writing. I contacted you because I think I have a mutually beneficial agreement that will allow you to make additional money for articles you are already writing online. Let me give you an idea of how we can help each other. 
We’re looking for writers that can help increase the profile of our clients by linking to them within the context of their articles. The clients are huge, and we generally have one that can fit naturally in the context of most article niches. 
In return, we pay generously for a single link for our clients. 
If you are interested, I’d love to talk about it more.


Regards, 
Bryan Clark

<p>Introduction: Dave Kane writes:
  
I [Kane] am involved in a dispute relating to whether or not a blog can be considered part of one’s academic writing.  Williams College restricts the use of undergraduate theses as follows:

 
Non-commercial, academic use within the scope of “Fair Use” standards is acceptable. Otherwise, you may not copy or distribute any content without the permission of the copyright holder.
 

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.
      
Parenthetically, your readers might be interested in the substantive discovery here, the details of the Williams admissions process (which is probably very similar to Columbia’s). Williams places students into academic rating (AR) categories as follows:

<p>Introduction: Surfing the  blogroll , I found myself on Helen DeWitt’s  page  and noticed the link to the Joshua Clover, alias Jane Dark.  I hadn’t checked out Clover for awhile (see my reactions  here  and  here ), so I decided to head on over.
 
Here’s what it looked like:
 
   
 
“The case against the Federal minimum wage,” huh?  That surprised me, as I had the vague impression that Clover was on the far left of the American political spectrum.  But I guess he could have some sort of wonky thing going on, or maybe there’s some unexpected twist?  It seemed a bit off of Clover’s usual cultural-criticism beat, so I clicked through to take a look . . . and it was just a boring set of paragraphs on the minimum wage.
 
Hmmmm.  I went back to the homepage, looked around more carefully, and realized that the blog is fake, the online equivalent of those fake book spines that are used to simulate rows of books on a bookshelf.
 
I don’t know what happened.  My guess is that Clover got tired of blogging and</p><p>5 0.70714867 <a title="1033-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-19-Alexa%2C_Maricel%2C_and_Marty%3A__Three_cellular_automata_who_got_on_my_nerves.html">1421 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-19-Alexa, Maricel, and Marty:  Three cellular automata who got on my nerves</a></p>

First, from “Alexa Russell,” subject line “An idea for a blog post: The Role, Importance, and Power of Words”:
  
Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best, 
Alexa

<p>Introduction: I just want to share with you the best comment we’ve every had in the nearly ten-year history of this blog.  Also it has statistical content!
 
Here’s the story.  After seeing an amusing  article  by Tom Scocca relating how reporter John Lee Anderson called someone as a “little twerp” on twitter:
 
 
 
I  conjectured  that Anderson suffered from “tall person syndrome,” that problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.
 
But I had no idea of Anderson’s actual height.  Commenter Gary  responded  with this impressive bit of investigative reporting:
  
Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be fairly tall. But the perspective makes it hard to judge.


Based on  this  picture: 
  
he appears to be about 9-10 inches taller than Catalina Garcia.


But how tall is Catalina Garcia? Not that tall – she’s  shorter  than the high-wire artist Phillipe Petit:

<p>Introduction: This  (forwarded to me from Jeff, from a powerpoint by Willam Gawthrop) wins not on form but on content:
 
   
 
Really this graph should stand alone but it’s so wonderful that I can’t resist pointing out a few things: 
   
- The gap between 610 and 622 A.D. seems to be about the same as the previous 600 years, and only a little less than the 1400 years before that.
 
- “Pious and devout” Jews are portrayed as having steadily increased in nonviolence up to the present day.  Been to Israel lately?
 
- I assume the line labeled “Bible” is referring to Christians?  I’m sort of amazed to see pious and devout Christians listed as being maximally violent at the beginning.  Huh?  I thought Christ was supposed to be a nonviolent, mellow dude.  The line starts at 3 B.C., implying that  baby Jesus  was at the extreme of violence.
 
Gong forward, we can learn from the graph that pious and devout Christians in 1492 or 1618, say, were much more peaceful than Jesus and his crew.

I followed the link, and my initial reaction was:  Interesting–but I don’t think something appearing at that “Zero Hedge” site can be trusted!  Did they ever apologize for  this bit of misinformation ?
 
Halvorsen replied:
 
I don’t know! But we do not need to trust zerohedge,  here is  financial times, also with more details.
 
Unfortunately the FT article has some sort of registration barrier, but I take exception to Tyler Durden’s snide remarks about “Banana Republics.”</p><p>4 0.88631237 <a title="1033-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-14-Hey%E2%80%94I_didn%E2%80%99t_know_that%21.html">1057 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-14-Hey—I didn’t know that!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Wikipedia (via  Jay Livingston ):
  
Newsweek sells only about 40,000 newsstand copies compared with 1.5 million subscriptions.  (Both figures are substantially lower than they were a decade ago.)  The figures for Time are about double those of Newsweek, but the ratio of newsstand sales to subscriptions is about the same.
  
I guess I’m not surprised that most of the sales are from subscriptions, but I’m surprised the fraction is so close to 100%.</p><p>5 0.86830378 <a title="1033-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-03-Model_Makers%E2%80%99_Hippocratic_Oath.html">552 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-03-Model Makers’ Hippocratic Oath</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Emanuel Derman  and  Paul Wilmott  wonder how to get their fellow modelers to give up their fantasy of perfection. In a  Business Week article  they proposed, not entirely in jest, a model makers’ Hippocratic Oath:
  
 I will remember that I didn’t make the world and that it doesn’t satisfy my equations. 
 Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics. 
 I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so. Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights. 
 I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.

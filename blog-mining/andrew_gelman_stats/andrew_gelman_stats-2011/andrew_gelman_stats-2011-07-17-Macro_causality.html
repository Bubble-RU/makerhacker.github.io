<p>Introduction: Economist David Backus  writes :
  
A casual reader of economic news can’t help but get the impression  that the way to get the economy moving is to have people spend more — consume more, in the language of macroeconomics.  Seems obvious, doesn’t it?  At the risk of making the obvious complicated, I’d say  it’s not so obvious.  It’s also not obvious that consumption has gone down since the crisis, or that saving has gone up.  So what’s going on with the labor market?
  
I’ll get to the rest of the explanation, but first some background.  The other day, I posted  posted  this remark from Backus:

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>5 0.1917893 <a title="807-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>

Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

Your blog has skirted around the value of observational studies and chided folks for using causal language when they only have associations but I sense that you ultimately find value in these associations. I would love for you to expand this thought in a blog. Specifically:


Does a measured association “suggest” a causal relationship? Are measured associations a good and efficient way to narrow the field of things that should be studied? Of all the things we should pursue, should we start with the stuff that has some largish measured association? Certainly many associations are not directly causal but due to joint association. Similarly, there must be many variables that are directly causally associated ( A -> B) but the effect, measured as an association, is masked by confounders. So if we took the “measured associations are worthwhile” approach, we’d never or rarely find the masked effects.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.

More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

 This  is from my area of work, macroeconomics.  The suggestion here is that the economy is growing slowly because consumers aren’t spending money.  But how do we know it’s not the reverse:  that consumers are spending less because the economy isn’t doing well.  As a teacher, I can tell you that it’s almost impossible to get students to understand that the first statement isn’t obviously true.  What I’d call the demand-side story (more spending leads to more output) is everywhere, including this piece, from the usually reliable David Leonhardt.
  
This whole situation reminds me of the story of the village whose inhabitants support themselves by taking in each others’ laundry.  I guess we’re rich enough in the U.S. that we can stay afloat for a few decades just buying things from each other?

<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.


Specifically, the so-called P value — a mathematical measure of the strength of the evidence that there’s a true difference between a treatment and placebo — was 0.08. . . . Technically, the study was a bust, although the results leaned toward a benefit from interferon gamma-1b. Was there a group of patients in which the results tipped?

<p>Introduction: I love  this stuff :
  
This article presents a simulation-based method designed to establish the computational correctness of software developed to fit a specific Bayesian model, capitalizing on properties of Bayesian posterior distributions. We illustrate the validation technique with two examples. The validation method is shown to find errors in software when they exist and, moreover, the validation output can be informative about the nature and location of such errors. We also compare our method with that of an earlier approach.

I ran several large-N experiments (separate participants) and looked at performance against age. What we want to do is compare age-of-peak-performance across the different tasks (again, different participants).


We bootstrapped age-of-peak-performance. On each iteration, we sampled (with replacement) the X scores at each age, where X=num of participants at that age, and recorded the age at which performance peaked on that task. We then recorded the age at which performance was at peak and repeated. Once we had distributions of age-of-peak-performance, we used the means and SDs to calculate t-statistics to compare the results across different tasks. For graphical presentation, we used medians, interquartile ranges, and 95% confidence intervals (based on the distributions: the range within which 75% and 95% of the bootstrapped peaks appeared).

I have read  your paper  [with Kobi Abayomi and Marc Levy] regarding multiple imputation application.


In order to diagnostic my imputed data, I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to compare the distribution differences between the imputed and observed values of a single attribute as mentioned in your paper. My question is:


For example I have this attribute X with the following data:  (NA = missing)


Original dataset: 1, NA, 3, 4, 1, 5, NA


Imputed dataset: 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6


a) in order to run the KS test, will I treat the observed data as 1, 3, 4,1, 5?


b) and for the observed data, will I treat 1, 2  , 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 as the imputed dataset for the K-S test? or just 2 ,6?


c) if I used m=5, I will have 5 set of imputed data sets. How would I apply K-S test to 5 of them and compare to the single observed distribution? Do I combine the 5 imputed data set into one by averaging each imputed values so I get one single imputed data and compare with the ob</p><p>6 0.94977641 <a title="807-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-23-A_statistical_version_of_Arrow%E2%80%99s_paradox.html">586 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-23-A statistical version of Arrow’s paradox</a></p>

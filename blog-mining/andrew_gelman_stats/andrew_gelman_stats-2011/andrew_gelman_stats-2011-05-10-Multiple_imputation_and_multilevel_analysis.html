It appears that multiple imputation appears to be the best way to impute missing data because of the more accurate quantification of variance. However, when imputing missing data for income values in national household surveys, would you recommend it would be practical to maintain the multiple datasets associated with multiple imputations, or a single imputation method would suffice. I have worked on household survey projects (in Scotland) and in the past gone with suggesting single methods for ease of implementation, but with the availability of open source R software I am think of performing multiple imputation methodologies, but a bit apprehensive because of the complexity and also the need to maintain multiple datasets (ease of implementation).

My reply:  Yes, this could be a problem.  I’d suggest combining some of your variables into a common score, or using only some of the variables, or using strong priors to control the inferences.

My research group is increasingly focusing on a series of problems that involve data that either have missingness or measurements that may have bias/error.  We have at times developed our own approaches to imputation (as simple as interpolating a missing unit and as sophisticated as a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model) and at other times, other groups impute the data. 


The outputs are being used to investigate the basic associations between pairs of variables, Xs and Ys, in regressions; we may or may not interpret these as causal.  I am contacting colleagues with relevant expertise to suggest good references on whether having imputed X and/or Y in a subsequent regression is correct or if it could somehow lead to biased/spurious associations.   Thinking about this, we can have at least the following situations (these could all be Bayesian or not):

Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

I’d imagine you’ve already received this, but just in case, here’s a cartoon you’d like. At first blush it seems to go against your advice (more nuanced than what I’m about to say by quoting the paper title) to not worry about multiple comparisons.


However, if I understand correctly your argument about multiple comparisons in multilevel models, the situation in this comic might have been avoided if shrinkage toward the grand mean (of all colors) had prevented the greens from clearing the .05 threshold.

I find the multilevel approach very useful for a problem I am dealing with, and I was wondering whether you could point me to some references about poolability tests for multilevel models. I am working with time series of cross sectional data and I want to test whether the data supports cross sectional and/or time pooling. In a standard panel data setting I do this with Chow tests and/or CUSUM. Are these ideas directly transferable to the multilevel setting?
  
My reply:  I think you should do partial pooling.  Once the question arises, just do it.  Other models are just special cases.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t see the need for any test.
 
That said, if you do a group-level model, you need to consider including group-level averages of individual predictors (see  here ).

<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.

<p>Introduction: Robert Birkelbach:
  
I am writing my Bachelor Thesis in which I want to assess the reading competencies of German elementary school children using the PIRLS2006 data. My levels are classrooms and the individuals. However, my dependent variable is a multiple imputed (m=5) reading test. The problem I have is, that I do not know, whether I can just calculate 5 linear multilevel models and then average all the results (the coefficients, standard deviation, bic, intra class correlation, R2, t-statistics, p-values etc) or if I need different formulas for integrating the results of the five models into one because it is a multilevel analysis? Do you think there’s a better way in solving my problem? I would greatly appreciate if you could help me with a problem regarding my analysis — I am quite a newbie to multilevel modeling and especially to multiple imputation. Also: Is it okay to use frequentist models when the multiple imputation was done bayesian? Would the different philosophies of sc</p><p>2 0.92948759 <a title="704-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-01-MacKay_update%3A__where_12_comes_from.html">986 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-01-MacKay update:  where 12 comes from</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In reply to my  question , David MacKay writes:
  
You said that can imagine rounding up 9 to 10 – which would be elegant if we worked in base 10.


But in the UK we haven’t switched to base 10 yet, we still work in  dozens and grosses.  (One gross = 12^2 = 144.)  So I was taught (by John Skilling, probably) “a dozen samples are plenty”. 


Probably in an earlier draft of the book in 2001 I said “a dozen”, rather than “12″.  Then some feedbacker may have written and said “I don’t know what a dozen is”;  so then I sacrificed elegant language and replaced “dozen” by “12″, which  leads to your mystification. 


PS – please send the winner of your competition a free copy of my other book ( sewtha ) too, from me. 


PPS I see that Mikkel Schmidt [in your comments] has diligently found the correct answer, which I guessed above. I suggest you award the prizes to him.
  
OK, we’re just  giving  away books here!
 
P.S.   See here  for my review of MacKay’s book on sustainable energy.</p><p>3 0.92680776 <a title="704-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-07-QB2.html">260 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-07-QB2</a></p>

Saw  you had a post  on the research I did with Rob Simmons on the NFL draft.  I have attached the article.  This article has not officially been published, so please don’t post this on-line.


The post you linked to states the following:   “On his blog, Berri says he restricts the analysis to QBs who have played more than 500 downs, or for 5 years. He also looks at per-play statistics, like touchdowns per game, to counter what he considers an opportunity bias.”


Two points:  First of all, we did not look at touchdowns per game (that is not a per play stat).  More importantly —  as this post indicates  — we did far more than just look at data after five years. 


We did mention the five year result, but directly below that discussion (and I mean, directly below), the following sentences appear.

 
Our data set runs from 1970 to 2007 (adjustments were made for how performance changed over time). We also looked at career performance after 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 years</p><p>4 0.9257164 <a title="704-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-16-%E2%80%9CIt_doesn%E2%80%99t_matter_if_you_believe_in_God.__What_matters_is_if_God_believes_in_you.%E2%80%9D.html">715 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-16-“It doesn’t matter if you believe in God.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>5 0.90966076 <a title="704-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-20-Burglars_are_local.html">156 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-20-Burglars are local</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  makes sense:
 
In the land of fiction, it’s the criminal’s modus operandi – his method of entry, his taste for certain jewellery and so forth – that can be used by detectives to identify his handiwork. The reality according to a new analysis of solved burglaries in the Northamptonshire region of England is that these aspects of criminal behaviour are on their own unreliable as identifying markers, most likely because they are dictated by circumstances rather than the criminal’s taste and style. However, the geographical spread and timing of a burglar’s crimes are distinctive, and could help with police investigations.
 
And, as a bonus,  more  Tourette’s pride!
 
P.S.  On yet another unrelated topic from the same blog, I wonder if the researchers in  this study  are aware that  the difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant .</p><p>6 0.90579844 <a title="704-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-13-Battle_of_the_NYT_opinion-page_economists.html">339 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-13-Battle of the NYT opinion-page economists</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Johathan Chait  writes :
  
 Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. 
  
I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstone’s excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on “The G.O.P.’s Dukakis Problem”?
 
I’ll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that I’m happy with Chait’s quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where I’m coming from but my take-home point is that we’re mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Chait  writes  that the most important aspect of a presidential candidate is “political talent”:
  
Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America. Favorite character types include jocks, movie stars, folksy Texans and war heroes. . . . [But the frontrunners for the 2012 Republican nomination] make Michael Dukakis look like John F. Kennedy. They are qualified enough to serve as president, but wildly unqualified to run for president. . . .

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas points me to  this excellently-titled working paper  by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen, and himself:
  
Is social media a valid indicator of political behavior? We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion. With over 500 million active users in 2012, Twitter now represents a new frontier for the study of human behavior. This research provides a framework for incorporating this emerging medium into the computational social science toolkit.

<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live. (The calculation is based on the chance that your district’s vote will be exactly tied, along with the chance that your di</p><p>6 0.13758838 <a title="1000-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-06-Why_it_can_be_rational_to_vote.html">1565 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-06-Why it can be rational to vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010. The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>3 0.84987402 <a title="1000-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-27-Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien_predict_a_50-seat_loss_for_Democrats_in_November.html">237 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-27-Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien predict a 50-seat loss for Democrats in November</a></p>
<p>Introduction: They  write :
  
How many House seats will the Republicans gain in 2010? . . . Our methodology replicates that for our ultimately successful forecast of the 2006 midterm. Two weeks before Election Day in 2006, we posted  a prediction that the Democrats would gain 32 seats and recapture the House majority. The Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006. Our current forecast for 2010 shows that the Republicans are likely to regain the House majority. . . . the most likely scenario is  a Republican majority in the neighborhood of 229 seats versus 206 for the Democrats for a 50-seat loss for the Democrats .
  
How do they do it?  First, they predict the national two-party vote using the generic polls (asking voters which party they plan to vote for in the November congressional elections).  Then they apply the national vote swing on a district-by-district level to predict the outcome in each district.  They account for uncertainty in their predictions (I assume by using a model similar to what  Gar</p><p>4 0.82965904 <a title="1000-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo%21.html">934 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Axelrod writes: 
  
  
Quantitative historian Allan Lichtman claims to have discovered 13 predictors that determine who will win the popular vote in presidential elections. He predicts Obama will win in 2012. Writing in his New York Times column, “538,” Nate Silver attempted a critique Lichtman’s prediction. Soon afterward Lichtman wrote a rejoinder. Evidently Lichtman has correctly and publicly predicted the popular vote winners in the last 7 presidential elections. I think he predicted Gore would win in 2000. He got the popular vote winner right, but not electoral college vote winner. Lichtman presents his methods in his early 1980s book, “The Keys to the White House.” Lichtman consulted with Volodia Keilis-Borok, and used a kernel discriminant analysis approach on election results from 1860-1980 as the training set. I think there is some argument as to scoring because Lichtman claims more than 7 successes.

<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery talk sense  here .  I am perhaps too influenced by Steven Rosenstoneâ&euro;&trade;s 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections, which is the first thing I read on the topic.  In any case, I agree with Nyhan and Montgomery that the difference in vote, comparing a centrist candidate to an extreme candidate, is probably on the order of 1-2%, not the 4% that has been posited by some.
 
Among other things, ideological differences between candidates of the same party might seem big in the primaries, but then when the general election comes along, party ID becomes more important.
 
I also disagree with the model in which presidential elections are like votes for high school  prom king .</p><p>2 0.93489575 <a title="1000-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-14-Preferential_admissions_for_children_of_elite_colleges.html">853 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-14-Preferential admissions for children of elite colleges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jenny Anderson  reports  on a discussion of the practice of colleges preferential admission of children of alumni:
  
 
[Richard] Kahlenberg citing research from his book “Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions” made the case that getting into good schools matters — 12 institutions making up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population produced 42 percent of government leaders and 54 percent of corporate leaders.


And being a legacy helps improve an applicant’s chances of getting in, with one study finding that being a primary legacy — the son or daughter of an undergraduate alumnus or alumna — increases one’s chance of admission by 45.1 percent.
 

 
I’d call that 45 percent but I get the basic idea.
 
But then Jeffrey Brenzel of the Yale admissions office replied:
  
“We turn away 80 percent of our legacies, and we feel it every day,” Mr. Brenzel said, adding that he rejected more offspring of the school’s Sterling donors than he accepted this year (</p><p>3 0.9049145 <a title="1000-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-%E2%80%9CThe_scientific_literature_must_be_cleansed_of_everything_that_is_fraudulent%2C_especially_if_it_involves_the_work_of_a_leading_academic%E2%80%9D.html">1599 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-“The scientific literature must be cleansed of everything that is fraudulent, especially if it involves the work of a leading academic”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone points me to  this report  from Tilburg University on disgraced psychology researcher Diederik Stapel.  The reports includes bits like this:
  
When the fraud was first discovered, limiting the harm it caused for the victims was a matter of urgency. This was particularly the case for Mr Stapel’s former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers . . . However, the Committees were of the opinion that the main bulk of the work had not yet even started. . . . Journal publications can often leave traces that reach far into and even beyond scientific disciplines. The self-cleansing character of science calls for fraudulent publications to be withdrawn and no longer to proliferate within the literature. In addition, based on their initial impressions, the Committees believed that there were other serious issues within Mr Stapel’s publications . . . This brought into the spotlight a research culture in which this sloppy science, alongside out-and-out fraud, was able to remain undetected</p><p>4 0.90310562 <a title="1000-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing_hardware.html">214 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Probability-processing hardware</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lyric Semiconductor   posted:
  

For over 60 years, computers have been based on digital computing principles. Data is represented as bits (0s and 1s). Boolean logic gates perform operations on these bits. A processor steps through many of these operations serially in order to perform a function. However, today’s most interesting problems are not at all suited to this approach.


Here at Lyric Semiconductor, we are redesigning information processing circuits from the ground up to natively process probabilities: from the gate circuits to the processor architecture to the programming language.  As a result, many applications that today require a thousand conventional processors will soon run in just one Lyric processor, providing 1,000x efficiencies in cost, power, and size.

<p>Introduction: My  cobloggers  sometimes write about “Politics Everywhere.”  Here’s an example of a political writer taking something that’s  not  particularly political and trying to twist it into a political context.  Perhaps the title should be “political journalism everywhere”.

Scientists have discovered a spinal fluid test that can predict with  100 percent accuracy  whether people who already have memory loss are going to develop full-fledged Alzheimer’s disease. They apparently don’t know whether this test works for people with no memory problems yet, but reading between the lines of the report in the New York Times August 10, it sounds as if they believe it will. . . . This is truly the apple of knowledge: a test that can be given to physically and mentally healthy people in the prime of life, which can identify with  perfect accuracy  which ones are slowly going to lose their mental capabilities.

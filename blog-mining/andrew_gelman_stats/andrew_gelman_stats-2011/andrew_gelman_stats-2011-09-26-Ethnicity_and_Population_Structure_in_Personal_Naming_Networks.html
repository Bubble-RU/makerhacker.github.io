<p>Introduction: Ubs writes: 
  
  
I was looking at baby name data last night and I stumbled upon something curious. I follow the  baby names blog  occasionally but not regularly, so I’m not sure if it’s been noticed before. Let me present it like this:  Take the statement…


Of the top 100 boys and top 100 girls names, only ___% contain the letter __.


I’m using the SSA baby names page, so that’s U.S. births, and I’m looking at the decade of 2000-2009 (so kids currently aged 4 to 13).  Which letters would you expect to have the lowest rate of occurrence?


As expected, the lowest score is for Q, which appears zero times.  (Jacqueline ranks #104 for girls.)  It’s the second lowest that surprised me.


(… You can pause and try to guess now. Spoilers to follow.)


Of the other big-point Scrabble letters, Z appears in four names (Elizabeth, Zachary, Mackenzie, Zoe) and X in six, of which five are closely related (Alexis, Alexander, Alexandra, Alexa, Alex, Xavier).  J is heavily overrepresented, especial</p><p>4 0.14105619 <a title="925-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-15-Mary%2C_Mary%2C_why_ya_buggin.html">2212 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-15-Mary, Mary, why ya buggin</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In our Cliff  thread  from yesterday, sociologist Philip Cohen pointed to  his discussions  in the decline in the popularity of the name Mary.
 
One thing that came up was the traditional trendiness of girls’ names.  So I thought I’d share my thoughts from a couple of years ago, as  reported  by David Leonhardt:
  
Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia and an amateur name-ologist, argues that many parents want their boys to seem mature and so pick classic names. William, David, Joseph and James, all longtime stalwarts, remain in the Top 20.


With girls, Gelman says, parents are attracted to names that convey youth even into adulthood and choose names that seem to be on the upswing. By the 1990s, of course, not many girls from the 1880s were still around, and that era’s names could seem fresh again. This search for youthfulness makes girls’ names more volatile — and increasingly so, as more statistics about names become available and parents grow more willing to experiment</p><p>5 0.12792465 <a title="925-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-17-Read_this_blog_on_Google_Currents.html">1065 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-17-Read this blog on Google Currents</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>3 0.69843036 <a title="925-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful_Line_Charts.html">1125 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-Beautiful Line Charts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I stumbled across a chart that’s in my opinion the best way to express a comparison of quantities through time:
 
   
 
It  compares  the new PC companies, such as Apple, to traditional PC companies like IBM and Compaq, but on the same scale. If you’d like to see how iPads and other novelties compare, see  here . I’ve tried to use the same type of visualization in my old work on  legal data visualization .
 
  
 
It comes from a new market research firm Asymco that also produced a very clean  income vs expenses  visualization (click to enlarge):
 
   
 
While the first figure is pure perfection, Tufte purists might find the second one too colorful. But to a busy person, color helps tell things apart: when I know that pink means interest, it takes a fraction of the second to assess the situation. We live in 2012, not in 1712 to have to think black and white.

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV. Only 3 of the 26 televisions we analyzed were discounte</p><p>5 0.68167692 <a title="925-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-27-White_stripes_and_dead_armadillos.html">2308 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-27-White stripes and dead armadillos</a></p>

For years I [Alper] have been obsessed by the color of the line which divides oncoming (i.e., opposing) traffic because I was firmly convinced that the color of the center line changed during my lifetime.  Yet, I never could find anyone who had the same remembrance (or interest in the topic).  The other day I found this  this  explanation that vindicates my recollection (and I was continuously out of the U.S. from 1969 to 1973):

 
The question of which color to use for highway center lines in the United States enjoyed considerable debate and changing standards over a period of several decades. By November 1954, 47 states had adopted white as their standard color for highway centerlines, with Oregon being the last holdout to use yellow. In 1958, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads adopted white as the standard color for the new interstate highway system. The 1971 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, however, mandated yellow as the standard color o</p><p>6 0.67886424 <a title="925-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-14-The_popularity_of_certain_baby_names_is_falling_off_the_clifffffffffffff.html">2211 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-14-The popularity of certain baby names is falling off the clifffffffffffff</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>2 0.96660101 <a title="925-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-My_talk_at_the_University_of_Michigan_today_4pm.html">1778 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-My talk at the University of Michigan today 4pm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.


I started asking hardcore math people — mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, rocket scientists — if they.’d ever u</p><p>4 0.95637709 <a title="925-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-Classic_probability_mistake%2C_this_time_in_the_%28virtual%29_pages_of_the_New_York_Times.html">386 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-Classic probability mistake, this time in the (virtual) pages of the New York Times</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xian pointed me to  this recycling  of a classic probability error.  It’s too bad it was in the New York Times, but at least it was in the Opinion Pages, so I guess that’s not so bad.  And, on the plus side, several of the blog commenters got the point.
 
What I was wondering, though, was who was this “Yitzhak Melechson, a statistics professor at the University of Tel Aviv”?  This is such a standard problem, I’m surprised to find a statistics professor making this mistake.  I was curious what his area of research is and where he was trained.
 
I started by googling Yitzhak Melechson but all I could find was this news story, over and over and over and over again.  Then I found Tel Aviv University and navigated to its statistics department but couldn’t find any Melechson in the faculty list.  Next stop:  entering Melechson in the search engine at the Tel Aviv University website.  It came up blank.
 
One last try:  I entered the Yitzhak Melechson into Google Scholar.  Here’s what came up:</p><p>same-blog 5 0.95364881 <a title="925-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-26-Ethnicity_and_Population_Structure_in_Personal_Naming_Networks.html">925 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-26-Ethnicity and Population Structure in Personal Naming Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks pointed me to  this recent article  by Pablo Mateos, Paul Longley, and David O’Sullivan on one of my favorite topics.
 
The authors produced a potentially cool  naming network of the city of Auckland New Zealand .  I say “potentially cool” because I have such difficulty reading the article–I speak English, statistics, and a bit of political science and economics, but this one is written in heavy sociologese–that I can’t quite be sure what they’re doing.  However, despite my (perhaps unfair) disdain for the particulars of their method, it’s probably good that they’re jumping in with this analysis.  Others can take their data (and similar datasets from elsewhere) and do better.  Ya gotta start somewhere, and the basic idea (to cluster first names that are associated with the same last names, and to cluster last names that are associated with the same first names) seems good.
 
I have to admit, though, that I was amused by the following line, which, amazingly, led off the paper:</p><p>6 0.94611305 <a title="925-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-27-%E2%80%9CThe_ultimate_left-wing_novel%E2%80%9D.html">682 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-27-“The ultimate left-wing novel”</a></p>

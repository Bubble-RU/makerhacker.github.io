<p>Introduction: Some things I respect 
 
When it comes to meta-models of statistics, here are two philosophies that I respect:
 
1.  (My) Bayesian approach, which I associate with E. T. Jaynes, in which you construct models with strong assumptions, ride your models hard, check their fit to data, and then scrap them and improve them as necessary.
 
2.  At the other extreme, model-free statistical procedures that are designed to work well under very weak assumptions—for example, instead of assuming a distribution is Gaussian, you would just want the procedure to work well under some conditions on the smoothness of the second derivative of the log density function.
 
Both the above philosophies recognize that (almost) all important assumptions will be wrong, and they resolve this concern via aggressive model checking or via robustness.  And of course there are intermediate positions, such as working with Bayesian models that have been shown to be robust, and then still checking them.  Or, to flip it arou</p><p>3 0.20380171 <a title="960-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-16-Long_discussion_about_causal_inference_and_the_use_of_hierarchical_models_to_bridge_between_different_inferential_settings.html">1418 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-16-Long discussion about causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I’m aware that there  are  some people who use a Bayesian approach largely because it allows them to provide a highly informative prior distribution based subjective judgment, but that is not the appeal of Bayesian methods for a lot of us practitioners. It’s disappointing and surprising, twenty years after my initial experiences, to still hear highly informed professional statisticians who think that what distinguishes Bayesian statistics from Frequentist statistics is “subjectivity” ( as seen in  a recent blog post and its comments ).
 
 My first encounter with Bayesian statistics was just over 20 years ago. I was a postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a new PhD in theoretical atomic physics but working on various problems related to the geographical and statistical distribution of indoor radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be dangerous if present at high concentrations). One of the issues I ran into right at the start was th</p><p>3 0.77536064 <a title="960-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-12-Finite-population_standard_deviation_in_a_hierarchical_model.html">464 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-12-Finite-population standard deviation in a hierarchical model</a></p>

My topic is regional variation in the cause-specific survival of breast cancer patients across the 21 hospital districts in Finland, this component being modeled by random effects. I am interested mainly in the district-specific effects, and with a hierarchical model I can get reasonable estimates also for sparsely populated districts.


Based on the recommendation given in the book by yourself and Dr. Hill (2007) I tend to think that the finite-population variance would be an appropriate measure to summarize the overall variation across the 21 districts. However, I feel it is somewhat incoherent first to assume a Normal distribution for the district effects, involving a “superpopulation” variance parameter, and then to compute the finite-population variance from the estimated district-specific parameters. I wonder whether the finite-population variance were more appropriate in the context of a model with fixed district effects?

<p>Introduction: David Radwin writes:
  
I am seeking a statistic measuring an estimate’s reliability or stability as an alternative to the coefficient of variation (CV), also known as the relative standard error. The CV is the standard error of an estimate (proportion, mean, regression coefficient, etc.) divided by the estimate itself, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if a survey finds 15% unemployment with a 6% standard error, the CV is .06/.15 = .4 = 40%.


Some US government agencies flag or suppress as unreliable any estimate with a CV over a certain threshold such as 30% or 50%. But this standard can be arbitrary (for example, 85% employment would have a much lower CV of .06/.85 = 7%), and the CV has other drawbacks I won’t elaborate here. I don’t need an evaluation of the wisdom of using the CV or anything else for measuring an estimate’s stability, but one of my projects calls for such a measure and I would like to find a better alternative.

I am an applied econometrician. The reason I am writing is that I am pondering a question for some time now and I am curious whether you have any views on it.


One problem the practitioner of instrumental variables estimation faces is large standard errors even with very large samples. Part of the problem is of course that one estimates a ratio. Anyhow, more often than not, I and many other researchers I know end up with large point estimates and standard errors when trying IV on a problem. Sometimes some of us are lucky and get a statistically significant result. Those estimates that make it beyond the 2 standard error threshold are often ridiculously large (one famous example in my line of research being Lleras-Muney’s estimates of the 10% effect of one year of schooling on mortality). The standard defense here is that IV estimates the complier-specific causal effect (which is mathematically correct). But still, I find many of the IV results (including my</p><p>6 0.74845624 <a title="960-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties_with_measurement-error_models_for_the_evaluation_of_wacky_claims.html">803 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties with measurement-error models for the evaluation of wacky claims</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>2 0.987499 <a title="960-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-08-Animated_drought_maps.html">1487 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-08-Animated drought maps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks sends along  this  dynamic graphic from Mike Bostock:
 
   
 
I’m not so happy with the arrangement of years by decade—the lineup of all years ending in 0, or 1, or 2, etc., seems a bit of a distraction—but in many ways the display is impressive.  And, as often is the case with such graphs, once it’s out there, other people can do similar things and make their own improvements.</p><p>3 0.98696125 <a title="960-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-A_graphics_talk_with_no_visuals%21.html">1598 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-A graphics talk with no visuals!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So, I’m at MIT, twenty minutes into my  talk  on tradeoffs in information graphics to the computer scientists, when the power goes out.  They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.  It went well, perhaps better than the actual talk would’ve gone, even though they didn’t get to see most of my  slides .</p><p>4 0.98574692 <a title="960-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-24-Always_check_your_evidence.html">1025 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-24-Always check your evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Logical reasoning typically takes the following form:
 
1.  I know that A is true. 
2.  I know that A implies B. 
3.  Therefore, I can conclude that B is true.
 
I, like Lewis Carroll, have  problems  with this process sometimes, but it’s pretty standard.
 
There is also a statistical version in which the above statements are replaced by averages (“A usually happens,” etc.).
 
But in all these stories, the argument can fall down if you get the facts wrong.  Perhaps that’s one reason that statisticians can be obsessed with detail. 
   
For example, David Brooks wrote the following, in a  column  called “Living with Mistakes”:
  
The historian Leslie Hannah identified the ten largest American companies in 1912. None of those companies ranked in the top 100 companies by 1990.
  
Huh?  Could that really be?  I googled “ten largest american companies 1912″ and found  this , from Leslie Hannah:
 
  
 
No big deal:  two still in the top 10 rather than zero in the top 100, but Brooks’s general</p><p>5 0.98562425 <a title="960-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-06-Suspicious_pattern_of_too-strong_replications_of_medical_research.html">700 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-06-Suspicious pattern of too-strong replications of medical research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes  in the Statistics Forum:
  
The Chinese scientific literature is rarely read or cited outside of China. But the authors of this work are usually knowledgeable of the non-Chinese literature — at least the A-list journals. And so they too try to replicate the alpha finding. But do they? One would think that they would find the same diminished effect size, but they don’t! Instead they replicate the original result, even larger.  Here’s one of the graphs:

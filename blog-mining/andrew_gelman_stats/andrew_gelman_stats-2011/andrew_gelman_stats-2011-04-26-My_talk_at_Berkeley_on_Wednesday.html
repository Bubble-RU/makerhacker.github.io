(1)  Of Beauty, Sex, and Power:  Statistical Challenges in the Estimation of Small Effects .  A silly example of the frequencies of boy and girl babies leads us to some important research involving the meaning of statistical significance. 
(2)  Mathematics, Statistics, and Political Science .  We explore the differences between mathematical and statistical thinking, developing the ideas using examples from my own research in political science. 
(3)  Statistics Teaching Activities .  For twenty years I have been collecting class-participation demonstrations in statistics and probability.

<p>Introduction: Xian posts his  memories  of Julian Besag, who is perhaps most famous for publishing the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (see  here  for some background).  I met Besag in 1989 when I spoke at the University of Washington; also I have a memory of a conference in 1992 or 1993, I think it was, when he objected strongly to my use of the chi-squared test to check the fit of a Bayesian model.  (In retrospect, I don’t think I presented my ideas clearly enough; some of the material in that talk ended up in  this article  with Meng and Stern.)  I also recall a talk I gave in Seattle around 1996, when Besag commented that the models I was using for spatial analysis were pretty crude–a fair comment, actually.  I don’t actually recall any of Besag’s lectures, but I read many of his papers.  As Xian said, Besag did innovative and important work on spatial statistics, work that will be long used and remembered.  He was in many ways ahead of his time and was a rarity in his generation of Bayesian statist</p><p>3 0.61213493 <a title="680-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-06-My_talk_at_Northwestern_University_tomorrow_%28Thursday%29.html">651 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-06-My talk at Northwestern University tomorrow (Thursday)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>5 0.60068101 <a title="680-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-13-Arnold_Zellner.html">205 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-13-Arnold Zellner</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Ziliak reports:
  
I [Ziliak] am sorry to share this sad news about Arnold Zellner (AEA Distinguished Fellow, 2002, ASA President, 1991, ISBA co-founding president, all around genius and sweet fellow), who died yesterday morning (August 11, 2010).   He was a truly great statistician and to me and to many others a generous and wonderful friend, colleague, and hero.  I will miss him.


His cancer was spreading everywhere though you wouldn’t know it as his energy level was Arnold’s typical: abnormally high.  But then he had a stroke just a few days after an unsuccessful surgery “to help with breathing” the doctor said, and the combination of events weakened him terribly.  He was vibrant through June and much of July, and maintained an 8 hour work day at the office.  He never lost his sense of humor nor his joy of life.  He died at home in hospice care and fortunately he did not suffer long.
  
From the official announcement from the University of Chicago:

<p>Introduction: I used  this convenient site  to create some images for a talk I’m preparing.  (The competing headlines:  “Beautiful parents have more daughters” vs. “No compelling evidence that beautiful parents are more or less likely to have daughters.”  The latter gets cut off at “No compelling evidence that,” which actually works pretty well to demonstrate the sort of dull headline that would result if newspapers were to publish null results.)</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91532892 <a title="680-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Something on Applied Bayesian Statistics
 
April 27, 4:10-5 p.m., 1011 Evans Hall
 
I will deliver  one  of the following three talks: 
1.  Of beauty, sex, and power: Statistical challenges in estimating small effects  
2.  Why we (usually) don’t worry about multiple comparisons  
3.  Parameterization and Bayesian modeling  
Whoever shows up on time to the seminar gets to vote, and I’ll give the talk that gets the most votes.</p><p>3 0.88533854 <a title="680-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-02-These_people_totally_don%E2%80%99t_know_what_Chance_magazine_is_all_about.html">1192 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-02-These people totally don’t know what Chance magazine is all about</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).


I would love for you (and anyone you’d like to</p><p>4 0.82669932 <a title="680-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-01-A_book_with_a_bunch_of_simple_graphs.html">1439 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-01-A book with a bunch of simple graphs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: Francis Tuerlinckx announces that he and Denny Borsboom have a joint postdoctoral position.  It sounds really cool:
  
The position is in the Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences at the University of Leuven (Belgium) and involves frequent travel to and contact with the Psychological Methods group in Amsterdam.


The research of the postdoc will be part of a larger program aimed at developing and applying methods for network analysis in psychology and psychopathology (see a recent review on the topic: Borsboom & Cramer, 2013). The specific research topic will depend on the expertise and interest of the candidate, but will involve one or more of the following: Statistical methods for high dimensional data, multilevel modeling, or nonlinear dynamical models.


Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Francis Tuerlinckx (francis.tuerlinckx@ppw.kuleuven.be) and Denny Borsboom (dennyborsboom@gmail.com) for more information.

<p>Introduction: The economy isn’t going so well, but there are some interesting possibilities here at Columbia University.  One such option that you should be thinking about is the  Earth Institute Fellowship , which pays well, includes a research stipend, and puts you in an exciting interdisciplinary community of faculty and postdoctoral researchers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia brings in several postdocs each year–it’s a two-year gig–and some of them have been statisticians (recently, Kenny Shirley and Leontine Alkema).  We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health.  It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.  The EI postdoc can be a place to do interesting work and begin a research career.
 
If you’re a statistician who’s interested in this fellowship, feel free to contact me directly–you have to apply to the Earth Institute directly (see link above), but I’m happy to give you advice about</p><p>2 0.94746596 <a title="971-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

<p>Introduction: Panos Ipeirotis  writes in his blog  post :
  

Everyone who has attended a conference knows that the quality of the talks is very uneven. There are talks that are highly engaging, entertaining, and describe nicely the research challenges and solutions. And there are talks that are a waste of time. Either the presenter cannot present clearly, or the presented content is impossible to digest within the time frame of the presentation.


We already have reviewing for the written part. The program committee examines the quality of the written  paper and vouch for its technical content. However, by looking at a paper it is impossible to know how nicely it can be presented. Perhaps the seemingly solid but boring paper can be a very entertaining presentation. Or an excellent paper may be written by a horrible presenter.


Why not having a second round of reviewing, where the authors of accepted papers submit their presentations (slides and a YouTube video) for presentation to the conference.</p><p>4 0.92374581 <a title="971-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Modeling_constrained_parameters.html">234 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Modeling constrained parameters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mike McLaughlin writes:
  
In general, is there any way to do MCMC with a fixed constraint?


E.g., suppose I measure the three internal angles of a triangle with errors ~dnorm(0, tau) where tau might be different for the three measurements.  This would be an easy BUGS/WinBUGS/JAGS exercise but suppose, in addition, I wanted to include prior information to the effect that the three angles had to total 180 degrees exactly.


Is this feasible? Could you point me to any BUGS model in which a constraint of this type is implemented?


Note: Even in my own (non-hierarchical) code which tends to be component-wise, random-walk Metropolis with tuned Laplacian proposals, I cannot see how I could incorporate such a constraint.
  
My reply:  See page 508 of Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd edition).  We have an example of such a model there (from  this paper  with Bois and Jiang).</p><p>5 0.92158431 <a title="971-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.

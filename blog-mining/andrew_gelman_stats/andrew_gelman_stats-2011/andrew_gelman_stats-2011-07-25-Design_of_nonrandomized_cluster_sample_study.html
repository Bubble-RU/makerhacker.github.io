I’m having a methodological problem and I saw the syllabus for your sampling class online and thought I might be able to ask you about it?


We do a lot of complex surveys nationwide; our typical sample design is as follows:


- stratify by rural/urban/capital 
- sub-stratify the rural and urban strata into NE/NW/SE/SW geographic quadrants 
- select voting precincts as PSUs 
- select households as SSUs 
- select individual respondents as TSUs


I’m relatively new here, and past practice has been to sample voting precincts with probability proportional to size.  It’s desirable because it’s not logistically feasible for us to vary the number of interviews per precinct with precinct size, so it makes the selection probabilities for households more even across precinct sizes. However, I have a complex sampling textbook (Lohr 1999), and it explains how complex it is to calculate sel</p><p>4 0.14257419 <a title="820-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-04-Statistics_ethics_question.html">695 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-04-Statistics ethics question</a></p>

I have been asked to do the statistical analysis for a medical unit that is delivering a pilot study of a program to [details redacted to prevent identification]. They are using a prospective, nonrandomized, cohort-controlled trial study design.


The investigator thinks they can recruit only a small number of treatment and control cases, maybe less than 30 in total.  After I told the Investigator that I cannot do anything statistically with a sample size that small, he responded that small sample sizes are common in this field, and he send me an example of analysis that someone had done on a similar study.


So he still wants me to come up with a statistical plan. Is it unethical for me to do anything other than descriptive statistics? I think he should just stick to qualitative research. But the study she mentions above has 40 subjects and apparently had enough power to detect some effects.

<p>Introduction: 25. You are using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to a survey of 1500 people to estimate support for the space program, by state. The model is fit using, as a state- level predictor, the Republican presidential vote in the state, which turns out to have a low correlation with support for the space program. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demo- graphic characteristics of the respondents in the sample from that state.
 
(b) For small states, the MRP estimates will be determined almost entirely by the demographic characteristics of the population in that state.
 
(c) Adding a predictor specifically for this model (for example, a measure of per-capita space-program spending in the state) could dramatically improve the estimates of state-level opinion.
 
(d) It would not be appropriate to add a predictor such as per-capita space-program spen</p><p>6 0.12704009 <a title="820-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-06-04-All_the_Assumptions_That_Are_My_Life.html">2359 andrew gelman stats-2014-06-04-All the Assumptions That Are My Life</a></p>

2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)


(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.


(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.


(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.

<p>Introduction: Lets say you are repeatedly going to recieve unselected sets of well done RCTs on various say medical treatments.
 
One reasonable assumption with all of these treatments is that they are monotonic – either helpful or harmful for all. The treatment effect will (as always) vary for subgroups in the population – these will not be explicitly identified in the studies – but each study very likely will enroll different percentages of the variuos patient subgroups. Being all randomized studies these subgroups will be balanced in the treatment versus control arms – but each study will (as always) be estimating a different – but exchangeable – treatment effect (Exhangeable due to the ignorance about the subgroup memberships of the enrolled patients.) 
 
That reasonable assumption – monotonicity – will be to some extent (as always) wrong, but given that it is a risk believed well worth taking – if the average effect in any population is positive (versus negative) the average effect in any other</p><p>6 0.68378341 <a title="820-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-12-Question_2_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1315 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-12-Question 2 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>

Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>2 0.96948087 <a title="820-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-03-is_it_possible_to_%E2%80%9Coverstratify%E2%80%9D_when_assigning_a_treatment_in_a_randomized_control_trial%3F.html">553 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-03-is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?</a></p>

is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?  I [Bergman] have a sample size of roughly 400 people, and several binary variables correlate strongly with the outcome of interest and would also define interesting subgroups for analysis.  The problem is, stratifying over all of these (five or six) variables leaves me with strata that have only 1 person in them.  I have done some background reading on whether there is a rule of thumb for the maximum number of variables to stratify.  There does not seem to be much agreement (some say there should be between N/50-N/100 strata, others say as few as possible).  In economics, the paper I looked to is here, which seems to summarize literature related to clinical trials.  In short, my question is: is it bad to have several strata with 1 person in them? Should I group these people in with another stratum?

I have a design question which has been bothering me and wonder if you can clear for me. In my line of work, we often conveniently select health centers and from those sample patients. When I am doing sample size estimation under this design do I account for the design effect – since I expect outcomes in patients from the same health center to be correlated? Given that I didn’t random sample the health facilities, is my only limitation that I cannot generalize the results and make group level comparisons in the analysis?
  
My response:
 
You can generalize the results even if you didn’t randomly sample the health facilities.  The only thing is that your generalization applies to the implicit population of facilities to which your sample is representative.  You could try to move further on this by considering facility-level predictors.  Regarding sample size estimation, see  chapter 20 .</p><p>4 0.96261418 <a title="820-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-07-Chi-square_FAIL_when_many_cells_have_small_expected_values.html">996 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-07-Chi-square FAIL when many cells have small expected values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: William Perkins, Mark Tygert, and Rachel Ward  write :
  
If a discrete probability distribution in a model being tested for goodness-of-fit is not close to uniform, then forming the Pearson χ2 statistic can involve division by nearly zero. This often leads to serious trouble in practice — even in the absence of round-off errors . . .
  
The problem is not merely that the chi-squared  statistic  doesn’t have the advertised chi-squared  distribution —a reference distribution can always be computed via simulation, either using the posterior predictive distribution or by conditioning on a point estimate of the cell expectations and then making a degrees-of-freedom sort of adjustment.
 
Rather, the problem is that, when there are lots of cells with near-zero expectation, the chi-squared test is mostly noise.
 
And this is not merely a theoretical problem.  It comes up in real examples.
 
Here’s one, taken from the classic 1992 genetics paper of Guo and Thomspson:

<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

<p>Introduction: We had some questions on the Stan list regarding identification.  The topic arose because people were fitting models with improper posterior distributions, the kind of model where there’s a ridge in the likelihood and the parameters are not otherwise constrained.
 
I tried to help by writing something on Bayesian identifiability for the Stan list.  Then Ben Goodrich came along and cleaned up what I wrote.  I think this might be of interest to many of you so I’ll repeat the discussion here.
 
Here’s what I wrote:
  
Identification is actually a tricky concept and is not so clearly defined.  In the broadest sense, a Bayesian model is identified if the posterior distribution is proper.  Then one can do Bayesian inference and that’s that.  No need to require a finite variance or even a finite mean, all that’s needed is a finite integral of the probability distribution.


That said, there are some reasons why a stronger definition can be useful:

One problem the practitioner of instrumental variables estimation faces is large standard errors even with very large samples. Part of the problem is of course that one estimates a ratio. Anyhow, more often than not, I and many other researchers I know end up with large point estimates and standard errors when trying IV on a problem. Sometimes some of us are lucky and get a statistically significant result. Those estimates that make it beyond the 2 standard error threshold are often ridiculously large (one famous example in my line of research being Lleras-Muney’s estimates of the 10% effect of one year of schooling on mortality). The standard defense here is that IV estimates the complier-specific causal effect (which is mathematically correct). But still, I find many of the IV results (including my</p><p>4 0.1232539 <a title="550-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-My_talk_at_the_University_of_Michigan_today_4pm.html">1778 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-My talk at the University of Michigan today 4pm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>5 0.12130314 <a title="550-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-15-Forward_causal_reasoning_statements_are_about_estimation%3B_reverse_causal_questions_are_about_model_checking_and_hypothesis_generation.html">1939 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-15-Forward causal reasoning statements are about estimation; reverse causal questions are about model checking and hypothesis generation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>6 0.11921454 <a title="550-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-30-The_Roy_causal_model%3F.html">1962 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-30-The Roy causal model?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein pointed me to  this  post by Michael Nielsen on how to teach Simpson’s paradox.
 
I don’t know if Nielsen (and others) are aware that people have developed some snappy graphical methods for displaying Simpson’s paradox (and, more generally, aggregation issues).  We do some this in our Red State Blue State book, but before that was the BK plot,  named by Howard Wainer  after a 2001 paper by Stuart Baker and Barnett Kramer, although in apparently appeared earlier in a 1987 paper by Jeon, Chung, and Bae, and doubtless was made by various other people before then.
 
Here’s Wainer’s graphical explication from 2002 (adapted from Baker and Kramer’s 2001 paper):
 
 
 
   
Here’s the version from our 2007 article (with Boris Shor, Joe Bafumi, and David Park):
 
 
 
But I recommend  Wainer’s article  (linked to above) as the first thing to read on the topic of presenting aggregation paradoxes in a clear and grabby way.

<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>6 0.94357157 <a title="550-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-14-Is_it_1930%3F.html">84 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-14-Is it 1930?</a></p>

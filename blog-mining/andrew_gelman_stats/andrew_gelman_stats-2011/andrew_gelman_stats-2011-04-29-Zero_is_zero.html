I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

I [Rogers] am a member of an online community of statisticians where I burn a great deal of time (and a recovering cog sci researcher). Our community website is a peer-reviewed Q and A spanning stats topics ranging from applications to mathematical theory. Our online community consists of mostly university faculty, grad students and technical consultants. The answer quality is very strong and the web design is intuitive. I think you and your readers are like-minded and would be really interested in some of the topics on the site,  CrossValidated  (you may know the sister site:  stackoverflow.com ). The philosophy is purely to further knowledge for the sake of knowledge and take pride in learning.
  
I took a quick look and the site seemed like it could be useful to people.  The only thing I didn’t understand is, why doesn’t it have a search function?  (Or maybe it was there somewhere and I couldn’t find it.)

<p>Introduction: Howard Friedman sent me a new book, The Measure of a Nation, subtitled How to Regain America’s Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing. Without commenting on the substance of Friedman’s recommendations, I’d like to endorse his strategy of presentation, which is to display graph after graph after graph showing the same message over and over again, which is that the U.S. is outperformed by various other countries (mostly in Europe) on a variety of measures. These aren’t graphs I would ever make—they are scatterplots in which the x-axis conveys no information. But they have the advantage of repetition: once you figure out how to read one of the graphs, you can read the others easily.
 
Here’s an  example  which I found from a quick Google:
 
   
 
I can’t actually figure out what is happening on the x-axis, nor do I understand the “star, middle child, dog” thing. But I like the use of graphics. Lots more fun than bullet points. Seriously.

I thought I had read on your blog that bar charts should always include zero on the scale, but a search of your blog (or google) didn’t return what I was looking for.  Is it considered a best practice to always include zero on the axis for bar charts?  Has this been written in a book?
  
My reply:
 
The idea is that the area of the bar represents “how many” or “how much.” The bar has to go down to 0 for that to work.  You don’t have to have your y-axis go to zero, but if you want the axis to go anywhere else, don’t use a bar graph, use a line graph.  Usually line graphs are better anyway.
 
I’m sure this is all in a book somewhere.</p><p>2 0.98016846 <a title="687-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-08-I_Am_Too_Absolutely_Heteroskedastic_for_This_Probit_Model.html">1047 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-08-I Am Too Absolutely Heteroskedastic for This Probit Model</a></p>

I’m working on a project that uses a binary choice model on panel data. Since I have panel data and am using MLE, I’m concerned about heteroskedasticity making my estimates inconsistent and biased. 


Are you familiar with any statistical packages with pre-built tests for heteroskedasticity in binary choice ML models? If not, is there value in cutting my data into groups over which I guess the error variance might vary and eyeballing residual plots? Have you other suggestions about how I might resolve this concern?
  
I replied that I wouldn’t worry so much about heteroskedasticity.  Breaking up the data into pieces might make sense, but for the purpose of estimating how the coefficients might vary—that is, nonlinearity and interactions.
 
Soren shot back:
  
I’m somewhat puzzled however: homoskedasticity is an identifying assumption in estimating a probit model: if we don’t have it all sorts of bad things can happen to our parameter estimates.

Consider the Seeds example in vol. 1 of the BUGS examples.  There, a binomial likelihood has a p parameter constructed, via logit, from two covariates.  What I am wondering is: Would it be legitimate, in a binomial + logit problem like this, to allow binomial p[i] to be a function of the corresponding n[i] or would that amount to using the data in the prior?  In other words, in the context of the Seeds example, is r[] the only data or is n[] data as well and therefore not permissible in a prior formulation?


I [McLaughlin] currently have a model with a common beta prior for all p[i] but would like to mitigate this commonality (a kind of James-Stein effect) when there are lots of observations for some i.  But this seems to feed the data back into the prior.  Does it really?


It also occurs to me [McLaughlin] that, perhaps, a binomial likelihood is not the one to use here (not flexible enough).

<p>Introduction: Seth sent along an article (not by him) from the psychology literature and wrote:
  
This is a good example of your complaint about statistical significance. The authors want to say that predictability of information determines how distracting something is and have two conditions that vary in predictability. One is significantly distracting, the other isn’t. But the two conditions are not significantly different from each other. So the two conditions are different more weakly than p = 0.05.


I don’t think the reviewers failed to notice this. They just thought it should be published anyway, is my guess.


To me, the interesting question is: where should the bar be? at p = 0.05? at p = 0.10? something else? How can we figure out where to put the bar?
  
I replied:
 
My quick answer is that we have to get away from .05 and .10 and move to something that takes into account prior information.

I will restrict my discussion to social science examples. Social scientists are often tempted to illustrate their ideas with examples from medical research. When it comes to medicine, though, we are, with rare exceptions, at best ignorant laypersons (in my case, not even reaching that level), and it is my impression that by reaching for medical analogies we are implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes. Evidence-based medicine is the subject of a large literature of its own (see, for example, Lau, Ioannidis, and Schmid, 1998).</p><p>6 0.96079963 <a title="687-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-18-There_are_no_fat_sprinters.html">1905 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-18-There are no fat sprinters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A  recent article  on global warming reminded me of the difficulty of letting the data speak.  William Nordhaus shows the following graph: 
   
   
 
And then he writes:
  
One of the reasons that drawing conclusions on temperature trends is tricky is that the historical temperature series is highly volatile, as can be seen in the figure. The presence of short-term volatility requires looking at long-term trends. A useful analogy is the stock market. Suppose an analyst says that because real stock prices have declined over the last decade (which is true), it follows that there is no upward trend. Here again, an examination of the long-term data would quickly show this to be incorrect. The last decade of temperature and stock market data is not representative of the longer-term trends.


The finding that global temperatures are rising over the last century-plus is one of the most robust findings of climate science and statistics.

<p>Introduction: This time  from  Bernard Fraga and Eitan Hersh.  Once you think about it, it’s hard to imagine any nonzero treatment effects that don’t vary.  I’m glad to see this area of research becoming more prominent.  ( Here ‘s a discussion of another political science example, also of voter turnout, from a few years ago, from Avi Feller and Chris Holmes.)

<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  wrote  that Mickey Kaus was right to point out that it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.” As Kaus points out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.  The slogan is particularly silly for Tip O’Neill himself.  Sure, O’Neill had to have a firm grip on local politics to get his safe seat in the first place, but after that it was smooth sailing.
 
Jonathan Bernstein  disagrees , writing:
  
 
Yes, but: don’t most Members of the House have ironclad partisan districts?  And isn’t the most important single thing they can do to protect themselves involve having pull in state politics to avoid being gerrymandered?  That is “all politics is local,” no? 


There’s also a fair amount they can do to stay on the good side of their local party, thus avoiding a primary fight.  And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>5 0.13353673 <a title="518-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-15-Forward_causal_reasoning_statements_are_about_estimation%3B_reverse_causal_questions_are_about_model_checking_and_hypothesis_generation.html">1939 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-15-Forward causal reasoning statements are about estimation; reverse causal questions are about model checking and hypothesis generation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consider two broad classes of inferential  questions :
  
1.  Forward causal inference . What might happen if we do X? What are the effects of smoking on health, the effects of schooling on knowledge, the effect of campaigns on election outcomes, and so forth?


2.  Reverse causal inference . What causes Y? Why do more attractive people earn more money? Why do many poor people vote for Republicans and rich people vote for Democrats? Why did the economy collapse?
  
When statisticians and econometricians write about causal inference, they focus on forward causal questions.  Rubin always told us:  Never ask Why?  Only ask What if?  And, from the econ perspective, causation is typically framed in terms of manipulations:  if x had changed by 1, how much would y be expected to change, holding all else constant?
 
But reverse causal questions are important too.  They’re a natural way to think (consider the importance of the word “Why”) and are arguably more important than forward questions.</p><p>6 0.13121334 <a title="518-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-15-Blaming_scientific_fraud_on_the_Kuhnians.html">1982 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-15-Blaming scientific fraud on the Kuhnians</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.  Computer science student Elias Bareinboim gave the following example:  “suppose we know nothing a</p><p>3 0.75427735 <a title="518-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties_with_measurement-error_models_for_the_evaluation_of_wacky_claims.html">803 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-14-Subtleties with measurement-error models for the evaluation of wacky claims</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  discussed  the evaluation of somewhat-plausible claims that are somewhat supported by theory and somewhat supported by statistical evidence.  One point I raised was that an implausibly large estimate of effect size can be cause for concern:
  
Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the name-choice article by Pelham et al.) argued that the implied effects were too large to be believed (just as I was arguing above regarding the July 4th study), which makes more plausible his claims that the results arise from methodological artifacts.


That calculation is straight Bayes: the distribution of systematic errors has much longer tails than the distribution of random errors, so the larger the estimated effect, the more likely it is to be a mistake. This little theoretical result is a bit annoying, because it is the larger effects that are the most interesting!”
  
Larry Bartels notes that my reasoning above is a bit incoherent:

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Martin Lindquist and Michael Sobel published a  fun little article  in Neuroimage on models and assumptions for causal inference with intermediate outcomes. As their subtitle indicates (“A response to the comments on our comment”), this is a topic of some controversy. Lindquist and Sobel write:
  
Our original comment (Lindquist and Sobel, 2011) made explicit the types of assumptions neuroimaging researchers are making when directed graphical models (DGMs), which include certain types of structural equation models (SEMs), are used to estimate causal effects. When these assumptions, which many researchers are not aware of, are not met, parameters of these models should not be interpreted as effects. . . . [Judea] Pearl does not disagree with anything we stated. However, he takes exception to our use of potential outcomes notation, which is the standard notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference, and his comment is devoted to promoting his alternative conventions.

<p>Introduction: Jas sends along  this paper  (with Devin Caughey), entitled Regression-Discontinuity Designs and Popular Elections: Implications of Pro-Incumbent Bias in Close U.S. House Races, and writes:
  
The paper shows that regression discontinuity does not work for US House elections. Close House elections are anything but random. It isn’t election recounts or something like that (we collect recount data to show that it isn’t).  We have collected much new data to try to hunt down what is going on (e.g., campaign finance data, CQ pre-election forecasts, correct many errors in the Lee dataset). The substantive implications are interesting.  We also have a section that compares in details Gelman and King versus the Lee estimand and estimator.
  
I had a few comments:
  

 
David Lee is not estimating the effect of incumbency; he’s estimating the effect of the incumbent party, which is a completely different thing.  The regression discontinuity design is completely inappropriate for estimating the</p><p>2 0.97155261 <a title="518-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-02-Moving_beyond_hopeless_graphics.html">1403 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-02-Moving beyond hopeless graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was at a talk awhile ago where the speaker presented tables with 4, 5, 6, even 8 significant digits even though, as is usual, only the first or second digit of each number conveyed any useful information.  A graph would be better, but even if you’re too lazy to make a plot, a bit of rounding would seem to be required.
 
I mentioned this to a colleague, who responded:
  
I don’t know how to stop this practice.  Logic doesn’t work.  Maybe ridicule?  Best hope is the departure from field who do it.  (Theories don’t die, but the people who follow those theories retire.)
  
Another possibility, I think, is helpful software defaults.  If we can get to the people who write the software, maybe we could have some impact.
 
Once the software is written, however, it’s probably too late.  I’m not far from the center of the R universe, but I don’t know if I’ll ever succeed in my goals of increasing the default number of histogram bars or reducing the default number of decimal places in regression</p><p>3 0.96400821 <a title="518-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy_of_Bayes_and_non-Bayes%3A__A_dialogue_with_Deborah_Mayo.html">291 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-22-Philosophy of Bayes and non-Bayes:  A dialogue with Deborah Mayo</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I sent Deborah Mayo a link to  my paper  with Cosma Shalizi on the philosophy of statistics, and she sent me the link to this conference which unfortunately already occurred.  (It’s too bad, because I’d have liked to have been there.)  I summarized my philosophy as follows:
  
I am highly sympathetic to the approach of Lakatos (or of Popper, if you consider Lakatos’s “Popper_2″ to be a reasonable simulation of the true Popperism), in that (a) I view statistical models as being built within theoretical structures, and (b) I see the checking and refutation of models to be a key part of scientific progress.  A big problem I have with mainstream Bayesianism is its “inductivist” view that science can operate completely smoothly with posterior updates:  the idea that new data causes us to increase the posterior probability of good models and decrease the posterior probability of bad models.  I don’t buy that:  I see models as ever-changing entities that are flexible and can be patched and ex</p><p>4 0.9625293 <a title="518-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-08-Poli_sci_plagiarism_update%2C_and_a_note_about_the_benefits_of_not_caring.html">400 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-08-Poli sci plagiarism update, and a note about the benefits of not caring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:
  
The essence of plagiarism is passing off someone else’s work as</p><p>5 0.96200055 <a title="518-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-21-Building_a_regression_model_._._._with_only_27_data_points.html">1506 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-21-Building a regression model . . . with only 27 data points</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Silitonga writes:
  
I was wondering whether you would have any advice on building a regression model on a very small datasets. I’m in the midst of revamping the model to predict tax collections from unincorporated businesses. But I only have 27 data points, 27 years of annual data.  Any advice would be much appreciated.
  
My reply:
 
This sounds tough, especially given that 27 years of annual data isn’t even 27 independent data points.  
 
I have various essentially orthogonal suggestions:
 
1 [added after seeing John Cook's comment below].  Do your best, making as many assumptions as you need.  In a Bayesian context, this means that you’d use a strong and informative prior and let the data update it as appropriate.  In a less formal setting, you’d start with a guess of a model and then alter it to the extent that your data contradict your original guess.
 
2.  Get more data.  Not by getting information on more years (I assume you can’t do that) but by breaking up the data you do</p><p>6 0.95908755 <a title="518-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-01-Weighting_and_prediction_in_sample_surveys.html">784 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-01-Weighting and prediction in sample surveys</a></p>

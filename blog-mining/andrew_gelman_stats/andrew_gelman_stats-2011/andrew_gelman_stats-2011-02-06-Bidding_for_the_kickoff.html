To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line.

</p><p>11 Teams seeking to merely get the ball first would be discouraged from bidding too high–for example, the 45-yard line–as this could result in a kick-off pinning them far back in their own territory. [sent-12, score-0.648]

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  writes :
  
A recent study published in the Social Science Quarterly suggests that these moves may not lead to the happiness the fans envision (HT: the Sports Economist). E. Scott Adler, Michael J. Berry, and David Doherty looked at coaching changes from 1997 to 2010.  What they found should give pause to people who demanded a coaching change (or still hope for one). Here is how these authors summarize their findings:

 
. . . we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how entry conditions moderate the effects of coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects.


We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that</p><p>4 0.085147038 <a title="559-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-45%25_hitting%2C_25%25_fielding%2C_25%25_pitching%2C_and_100%25_not_telling_us_how_they_did_it.html">942 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-45% hitting, 25% fielding, 25% pitching, and 100% not telling us how they did it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A University of Delaware press release  reports :
  
This month, the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports will feature the article “An Estimate of How Hitting, Pitching, Fielding, and Base-stealing Impact Team Winning Percentages in Baseball.”  In it, University of Delaware Prof. Charles Pavitt of the Department of Communication defines the perfect “formula” for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams to use to build the ultimate winning team.


Pavitt found hitting accounts for more than 45 percent of teams’ winning records, fielding for 25 percent and pitching for 25 percent. And that the impact of stolen bases is greatly overestimated.


He crunched hitting, pitching, fielding and base-stealing records for every MLB team over a 48-year period from 1951-1998 with a method no other researcher has used in this area. In statistical parlance, he used a conceptual decomposition of offense and defense into its component parts and then analyzed recombinations of the parts in intuitively mea</p><p>5 0.08503744 <a title="559-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-Tenure_lets_you_handle_students_who_cheat.html">1028 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-Tenure lets you handle students who cheat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>6 0.077057138 <a title="559-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-25-College_football%2C_voting%2C_and_the_law_of_large_numbers.html">1547 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-25-College football, voting, and the law of large numbers</a></p>

Sitting on my [AT's] to-do list for a while now has been an exploration of Scrabble from an experimental design point of view; how to better design a tournament to make the variance as small as possible while still preserving the appearance of the home game to its players. . . . 


I’m proud (relieved?) to say that I’ve finally  finished the first draft  of this work for two-player head-to-head games, with a duplication method that ensures that if the game were repeated, each player would receive tiles from the reserve in the same sequence: think of the tiles being laid out in order (but unseen to the players), so that one player draws from the front and the other draws from the back. . . .


One goal of this was to figure out how much of the variance in score comes from the tile order and how much comes from the board, given that a tile order would be expected. It turns out to be about half-bag, half-board . . .


Some other findings from the simulations:

 Apropos of your recent  blog post about modeling score differential of basketball games , I thought you might enjoy a site I built, gambletron2000.com , that gathers real-time win probabilities from betting markets for most major sports (including NBA and college basketball). 
  
 My original goal was to use the variance of changes in win probabilities to quantify which games were the most exciting, but I got a bit carried away and ended up pursuing a bunch of other ideas, whichÂ  you can read about in the full writeup here  
  
 This particular passage from the anonymous someone in your post: 
  

My idea is for each timestep in a game (a second, 5 seconds, etc), use the Vegas line, the current score differential, who has the ball, and the number of possessions played already (to account for differences in pace) to create a point estimate probability of the home team winning.

<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes.

<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>2 0.73571467 <a title="559-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-13-CmdStan%2C_RStan%2C_PyStan_v2.2.0.html">2209 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-13-CmdStan, RStan, PyStan v2.2.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>6 0.62292564 <a title="559-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-02-Rational_addiction.html">444 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-02-Rational addiction</a></p>

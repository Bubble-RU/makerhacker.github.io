<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts writes:
  
The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>4 0.12156817 <a title="864-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-10-Statisticians%E2%80%99_abbreviations_are_even_less_interesting_than_these%21.html">1257 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-10-Statisticians’ abbreviations are even less interesting than these!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Interesting  article  by Jonah Berger and Gael Le Mens:
  
Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-r</p><p>6 0.094549499 <a title="864-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-21-Handbook_of_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo.html">674 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-21-Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Hogg sends in this  bizarre bit  of news reporting by Robert Evans:
  
Until now, in the four decades since it was first posited, no one has convincingly claimed to have glimpsed the Higgs Boson, let alone proved that it actually exists.


At an eagerly awaited briefing on Tuesday at the CERN research centre near Geneva, two independent teams of “Higgs Hunters” – a term they themselves hate – were widely expected to suggest they were fairly confident they had spotted it.


But not confident enough, in the physics world of ultra-precision where certainty has to be measured at nothing less than 100 percent, to announce “a discovery.”


In the jargon, this level is described as 5 sigma . . .
  
So far, so good.  But then comes this doozy:
  
As one scientist explained, that level of accuracy would equate to the 17th-century discoverer of gravity, Isaac Newton, sitting under his apple tree and a million apples one after another falling on his head without one missing.

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.  When learning science, we sometimes speak</p><p>4 0.69664288 <a title="864-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-How_the_ignorant_idiots_win%2C_explained.__Maybe..html">765 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-How the ignorant idiots win, explained.

<p>Introduction: According to a  New York Times article , cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have a new theory about rational argument: humans didn’t develop it in order to learn about the world, we developed it in order to win arguments with other people. “It was a purely social phenomenon. It evolved to help us convince others and to be careful when others try to convince us.” 
 
Based on the NYT article, it seems that Mercier and Sperber are basically flipping around the traditional argument, which is that humans learned to reason about the world, albeit imperfectly, and learned to use language to convey that reasoning to others.  These guys would suggest that it’s the other way around: we learned to argue with others, and this has gradually led to the ability to actually make (and recognize) sound arguments, but only indirectly.  The article says “”At least in some cultural contexts, this results in a kind of arms race towards greater sophistication in the production and evaluation o</p><p>5 0.68351746 <a title="864-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-What_Do_We_Learn_from_Narrow_Randomized_Studies%3F.html">732 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-What Do We Learn from Narrow Randomized Studies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the headline, “A Raise Won’t Make You Work Harder,” Ray Fisman  writes :
  
To understand why it might be a bad idea to cut wages in recessions, it’s useful to know how workers respond to changes in pay–both positive and negative changes. Discussion on the topic goes back at least as far as Henry Ford’s “5 dollars a day,” which he paid to assembly line workers in 1914. The policy was revolutionary at the time, as the wages were more than double what his competitors were paying. This wasn’t charity. Higher-paid workers were efficient workers–Ford attracted the best mechanics to his plant, and the high pay ensured that employees worked hard throughout their eight-hour shifts, knowing that if their pace slackened, they’d be out of a job. Raising salaries to boost productivity became known as “efficiency wages.”
  
So far, so good.  Fisman then moves from history and theory to recent research:

<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89361286 <a title="864-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-21-Going_viral_%E2%80%94_not%21.html">864 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-21-Going viral — not!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>3 0.86803615 <a title="864-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-11-Continuing_conflict_over_conflict_statistics.html">1798 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-11-Continuing conflict over conflict statistics</a></p>

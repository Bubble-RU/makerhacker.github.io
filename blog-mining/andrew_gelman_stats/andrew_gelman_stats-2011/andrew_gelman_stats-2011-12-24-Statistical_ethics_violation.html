A colleague recently forwarded to me your 2012  paper  with Hill and Yajima on the multiple comparison “non-problem”, as I call it.


You and your colleagues might find of interest  a 2012 paper  [with Celia Lombardi] that reaches similar conclusions by a colleague and myself which is attached. Similar but not identical, as we are a bit Bayesian-shy after seeing so many exaggerated claims made for Bayesian approaches over recent decades. 


I take pride in having for a few decades defended many colleagues against editors (and many graduate students against faculty members) who demanded “corrections” for multiple comparisons. We’ve gotten no small number of editors and professors to back off their unreasonable demands. Paper tigers all!

<p>Introduction: This  story  (“Yale tells students to keep Kissinger talk secret . . . ‘Dr. Kissinger’s visit to campus will not be publicized, so we appreciate your confidentiality…’”) reminds me of two things:
 
- In the 1980s, I once went to a public lecture at Harvard by Kissinger protogé Ted Koppel, who indeed has that deep Ted Koppel voice even when he’s just chatting (as I overheard).  Koppel insisted that the contents of his talk not be reported.  It was no great loss; he didn’t really have anything newsworthy to say.  The talk was fine, he told us some interesting things, just nothing that would’ve made the news or even the campus newspaper.  Still, it seemed kinda tacky for a reporter whose shtick was access to the powerful, to not want his own speech to be reported. 
 
- In the 1990s, a colleague of mine in a different dept told us that this professor from another university was coming by to give a lecture.  I told my colleague that I’d like to meet with the guy, as I wanted to ask his opin</p><p>6 0.094039634 <a title="1081-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-20-Stan%3A_A_%28Bayesian%29_Directed_Graphical_Model_Compiler.html">1131 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-20-Stan: A (Bayesian) Directed Graphical Model Compiler</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>3 0.63427198 <a title="1081-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-n_%3D_2.html">912 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-n = 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People in Chicago are nice.  The conductor on the train came by and I asked if I could buy a ticket right there.  He said yes, $2.50.  While I was getting the money he asked if the ticket machine at the station had been broken.  I said, I don’t know, I saw the train and ran up the stairs to catch it.  He said, that’s not what you’re supposed to say.  So I said, that’s right, the machine was broken.
 
It’s just like on that radio show where Peter Sagal hems and haws to clue the contestant in that his guess is wrong so he can try again.</p><p>4 0.62179106 <a title="1081-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-11-Migrating_your_blog_from_Movable_Type_to_WordPress.html">1530 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-11-Migrating your blog from Movable Type to WordPress</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

I have questions regarding one technique you and your colleagues described in your papers: the cross validation (Multiple Imputation with Diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening Windows into the Black Box, with reference to Gelman, King, and Liu, 1998). I think this is the technique I need for my purpose, but I am not sure I understand it right. I want to use the multiple imputation to estimate the outcome of psychotherapies based on longitudinal data. First I have to demonstrate that I am able to get unbiased estimates with the multiple imputation. The expected bias is the overestimation of the outcome of dropouts.


I will test my imputation strategies by means of a series of simulations (delete values, impute, compare with the original). Due to the complexity of the statistical analyses I think I need at least 200 cases. Now I don’t have so many cases without any missings. My data have missing values in different variables.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>3 0.90038896 <a title="1081-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-99%21.html">1394 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-99!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>6 0.83912861 <a title="1081-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-19-Statistical_discrimination_again.html">1541 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-19-Statistical discrimination again</a></p>

[sent-1, score-0.516]
</p><p>2 The presidential candidate is the star of a television show about a tall, attractive person who can be seen donning hard hats, nodding at the advice of military commanders and gazing off into the future. [sent-31, score-0.514]
</p><p>3 Here’s a graph based on Doug Hibbs’s model:       Sorry, but I don’t think the Democrats would’ve won the 1988 presidential election even if they’d had Burt Reynolds at the top of the ticket. [sent-38, score-0.487]
</p><p>4 It was by the end of the campaign, at which point voters focused more on party and ideology (see  this article ) and learned more about the candidates’ ideologies and issue positions, that they decided to go for the preppie from Connecticut over the wimp from Massachusetts. [sent-47, score-0.456]
</p><p>5 And the political-science view of presidential campaigns has been gaining ground among knowledgeable reporters as well. [sent-50, score-0.265]
</p><p>6 In the general election for president, the candidates are well-financed, are clearly distinguishable in ideology, and there are only two of them–thus none of the instability, associated with strategic voting, that we see in the primaries. [sent-60, score-0.273]
</p><p>7 I don’t know what’s gonna happen in 2012, but political science research suggests that the Republicans could nominate a goofy short guy with glasses, or a rude fat guy, or whatever, and it wouldn’t make much of a difference. [sent-61, score-0.225]
</p><p>8 I’m sure Chait means well and, yes, I know that most voters don’t know anything about the federal budget, probably half of them can’t find Miami on a map, etc. [sent-65, score-0.351]
</p><p>9 But there’s no evidence that people vote based on candidates’ looks. [sent-66, score-0.186]
</p><p>10 Certainly not in presidential elections where the stakes are high and their party identification is clear. [sent-67, score-0.393]
</p><p>11 If you want to rail at the mistakes voters make and the problems with our political system . [sent-68, score-0.348]
</p><p>12 But please please please please please don’t slam the voters for something they don’t do. [sent-73, score-0.764]
</p><p>13 So why are you so so so sure that the ordinary undecided voters is doing so? [sent-78, score-0.294]
</p><p>14 To think that they’re voting based on looks is just silly. [sent-81, score-0.226]
</p><p>15 Chait also pulls out this line:    A series of experiments has shown that subjects, even young children, can reliably pick the winners of races based solely on candidate photos. [sent-84, score-0.376]
</p><p>16 As I wrote a couple years ago  about a study that claimed an impressive 70% accuracy in predicting winners based on their looks:    It’s a funny result: at first it seems impressive–70% accuracy! [sent-86, score-0.309]
</p><p>17 –but then again it’s not so impressive given that you can predict something on the order of 90% of races just based on incumbency and the partisan preferences of the voters in the states and districts. [sent-87, score-0.475]
</p><p>18 I can’t be sure what’s happening here, but one possibility is that the more serious candidates (the ones we know are going to win anyway) are more attractive. [sent-88, score-0.223]
</p><p>19 I’m not saying that the study that  David Brooks  Jonathan Chait is citing is wrong, exactly, but I don’t think it provides evidence that Mitch Daniels would be dead meat in the presidential election. [sent-89, score-0.265]
</p><p>20 Why this annoys me so much    There’s some political science research on the importance of the fundamentals in presidential elections. [sent-91, score-0.394]

I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstone’s excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on “The G.O.P.’s Dukakis Problem”?
 
I’ll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that I’m happy with Chait’s quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where I’m coming from but my take-home point is that we’re mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: Political campaigns are commonly understood as random walks, during which, at any point in time, the level of support for any party or candidate is equally likely to go up or down. Each shift in the polls is then interpreted as the result of some combination of news and campaign strategies.
 
A completely different story of campaigns is the mean reversion model in which the elections are determined by fundamental factors of the economy and partisanship; the role of the campaign is to give voters a chance to reach their predetermined positions.
 
The popularity of the random walk model for polls may be partially explained via analogy to the widespread idea that stock prices reflect all available information, as popularized in Burton Malkiel’s book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Once the idea has sunk in that short-term changes in the stock market are inherently unpredictable, it is natural for journalists to think the same of polls.  For example, political analyst Nate Silver  wrote</p><p>4 0.23273021 <a title="654-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Two_stories_about_the_election_that_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">384 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Two stories about the election that I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>5 0.22692756 <a title="654-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.22324039 <a title="654-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Shankar Vedantam  writes :
  
Americans distrust the GOP. So why are they voting for it? . . . Gallup tells us that 71 percent of all Americans blame Republican policies for the bad economy, while only 48 percent blame the Obama administration. . . . while disapproval of congressional Democrats stands at 61 percent, disapproval of congressional Republicans stands at 67 percent.


[But] Republicans are heavily tipped to wrest control of one or both houses of Congress from the Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
  
Hey!  I know the answer to that one.  As I  wrote  in early September:
  
 
Those 10% or so of voters who plan to vote Republican–even while thinking that the Democrats will do a better job–are not necessarily being so unreasonable. The Democrats control the presidency and both houses of Congress, and so it’s a completely reasonable stance to prefer them to the Republicans yet still think they’ve gone too far and need a check on their power.

<p>Introduction: Bob Erikson, one of my colleagues at Columbia who knows much more about American politics than I do, sent in the following screed.  I’ll post Bob’s note, followed by my comments.

Monday morning many of us were startled by the following headline:

 
White House strenuously denies NYT report that it is considering getting aggressive about winning the midterm elections.
 

At first I [Bob] thought I was reading the Onion, but no, it was a sarcastic comment on the blog Talking Points Memo.  But the gist of the headline appears to be correct. Indeed, the New York Times reported that 

 
White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ‘There’s been no discussion of such a thing at the White House’

<p>Introduction: In the context of a discussion of Democratic party strategies, Matthew Yglesias  writes :
  
Given where things stood in January 2009, large House losses were essentially inevitable. The Democratic majority elected in 2008 was totally unsustainable and was doomed by basic regression to the mean.
  
I’d like to push back on this, if for no other reason than that  I  didn’t foresee all this back in January 2009.
 
Regression to the mean is a fine idea, but what’s the “mean” that you’re regressing to?  Here’s a graph I made  a couple years ago , showing the time series of Democratic vote share in congressional and presidential elections:
 
 
 
Take a look at the House vote in 2006 and 2008.  Is this a blip, just begging to be slammed down in 2010 by a regression to the mean?  Or does it represent a return to form, back to the 55% level of support that the Democrats had for most of the previous fifty years?  It’s not so obvious what to think–at least, not simply from looking at the graph.</p><p>6 0.84062111 <a title="654-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-16-What_I_learned_from_those_tough_538_commenters.html">210 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-16-What I learned from those tough 538 commenters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Chait  writes  that the most important aspect of a presidential candidate is “political talent”:
  
Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America. Favorite character types include jocks, movie stars, folksy Texans and war heroes. . . . [But the frontrunners for the 2012 Republican nomination] make Michael Dukakis look like John F. Kennedy. They are qualified enough to serve as president, but wildly unqualified to run for president. . . . [Mitch] Daniels’s drawbacks begin — but by no means end — with his lack of height, hair and charisma. . . . [Jeb Bush] suffers from an inherent branding challenge [because of his last name]. . . . [Chris] Christie . . . doesn’t cut a trim figure and who specializes in verbally abusing his constituents. . . .  [Haley] Barbour is the comic embodiment of his party’s most negative stereotypes.

<p>Introduction: Zosia Chustecka  writes : 
  
  
Much of the previous work on the link between cancer and nightshifts has focused on breast cancer . . . The latest report, focusing on ovarian cancer,  was published  in the April issue of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.


This increase in the risk for ovarian cancer with nightshift work is consistent with, and of similar magnitude to, the risk for breast cancer, say lead author Parveen Bhatti, PhD, and colleagues from the epidemiology program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.


The researchers examined data from a local population-based cancer registry that is part of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. They identified 1101 women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, 389 with borderline disease, and 1832 without ovarian cancer (control group).


The women, who were 35 to 74 years of age, were asked about the hours they worked, and specifically whether they had ever worked the nig</p><p>3 0.93691474 <a title="654-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan_Chait_and_I_agree_about_the_importance_of_the_fundamentals_in_determining_presidential_elections.html">656 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan Chait and I agree about the importance of the fundamentals in determining presidential elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Johathan Chait  writes :
  
 Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. 
  
I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstone’s excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on “The G.O.P.’s Dukakis Problem”?
 
I’ll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that I’m happy with Chait’s quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where I’m coming from but my take-home point is that we’re mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: Economist Stan Liebowitz has a  longstanding interest  in the difficulties of flagging published research errors.  Recently he wrote on the related topic of dishonest authorship:
  
While not about direct research fraud, I thought you might be interested in  this paper . It discusses the manner in which credit is given for economics articles, and I suspect it applies to many other areas as well. One of the conclusions is that the lack of complete proration per author will lead to excessive coauthorship, reducing overall research output by inducing the use of larger than efficient-sized teams. Under these circumstances, false authorship can be a response to the warped reward system and false authorship might improve research efficiency since it might keep actual research teams (as opposed to nominal teams) from being too large to produce research efficiently. One of the questions I rhetorically ask in the paper is whether anyone has ever been ‘punished’ for having their name included on</p><p>5 0.92809975 <a title="654-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-What_is_the_normal_range_of_values_in_a_medical_test%3F.html">923 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-What is the normal range of values in a medical test?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geoffrey Sheean writes: 
  
  
I am having trouble thinking Bayesianly about the so-called ‘normal’ or ‘reference’ values that I am supposed to use in some of the tests I perform. These values are obtained from purportedly healthy people. Setting aside concerns about ascertainment bias, non-parametric distributions, and the like, the values are usually obtained by setting the limits at ± 2SD from the mean. In some cases, supposedly because of a non-normal distribution, the third highest and lowest value observed in the healthy group sets the limits, on the assumption that no more than 2 results (out of 20 samples) are allowed to exceed these values: if there are 3 or more, then the test is assumed to be abnormal and the reference range is said to reflect the 90th percentile. The results are binary – normal, abnormal.


The relevance to the diseased state is this. People who are known unequivocally to have condition X show Y abnormalities in these tests.

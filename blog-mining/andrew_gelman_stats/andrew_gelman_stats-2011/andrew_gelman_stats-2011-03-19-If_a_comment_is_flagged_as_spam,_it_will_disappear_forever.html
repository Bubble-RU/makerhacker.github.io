I put it in the spam file manually.  If you’d like to participate in blog discussion in the future, please refrain from including spam links.  Thank you.

<p>Introduction: I have to go through the inbox to approve new comments.  When I set to auto-approve, I get overwhelmed with spam.  As is, I still get spam but it’s manageable.
 
Usually the spam is uninteresting but this one caught my eye:
 
   
 
At first this seemed reasonable enough:  law firm is desperate for business, spams blogs to raise its Google ranking.  But what’s with the writing in the actual comment?  It’s incoherent but it doesn’t look computer-generated.  My guess is that the law firm in Massachusetts hired a company that promised to raise their Google rankings, and that this company hired some non-English-speaking foreigners to search through the web and write some spam comments.  If anyone actually reads the comments, they might get the impression that this law firm is staffed by illiterates . . . but, as we all know, nobody reads blog comments!

<p>Introduction: I was talking with a colleague about one of our research projects and said that I would write something up, if blogging didn’t get in the way.  She suggested that for the next month I just blog about my research ideas.
 
So I think I’ll do that.  This means no mocking of plagiarists, no reflections on literature, no answers to miscellaneous questions about how many groups you need in a multilevel model, no rants about economists, no links to pretty graphs, etc., for 30 days.
 
Meanwhile, I have a roughly 30-day backlog.  So after my next 30 days of stat blogging, the backlog will gradually appear.  There’s some good stuff there, including reflections on Milos, a (sincere) tribute to the haters, an updated Twitteo Killed the Bloggio Star, a question about acupuncture, and some remote statistical modeling advice I gave that actually worked!  I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.
 
But you’ll have to wait for all that fun stuff.  For the next thirty days, it’s statistics research every day.

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.


VIII. If you want to share a copy of this image, please ask first. If you want a real copy, you can ask about that too.

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>4 0.87942159 <a title="619-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-18-What%E2%80%99s_my_Kasparov_number%3F.html">2105 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-18-What’s my Kasparov number?</a></p>

Personally my Kasparov number is two: I beat ** in a regular tournament game, and ** beat Kasparov!
  
That’s pretty impressive, especially given that I didn’t know this guy played chess at all!  Anyway, this got me thinking, what’s my Kasparov number?  OK, that’s easy.  I beat Magnus Carlsen the other day when he was passing through town on vacation, Carlsen beat Anand, . . .
 
OK, just kidding.  What  is  my Kasparov number, though? Note that the definition, unlike that of the Erdos or Bacon numbers, is asymmetric:  it has to be that I had a victory over person 1, and person 1 had a victory over person 2, etc., and ultimately person N-1 had a victory over Kasparov.  The games don’t have to be in time order, they just all have to be victories.  And we’ll further require that the games all be played after childhood and before senility (i.e., it doesn’t count if I happened to play someone who happens to be a cousin of some grandmaster whom he beat when they were b</p><p>5 0.87819374 <a title="619-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-31-Watercolor_regression.html">1478 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-31-Watercolor regression</a></p>

Two small follow-ups based on the  discussion  (the second/bigger one is to address your comment about the 95% CI edges).


1. I realized that if we plot the confidence intervals as a solid color that fades (eg. using the “fixed ink” scheme from before) we can make sure the regression line also has heightened visual weight where confidence is high by plotting the line white. This makes the contrast (and thus visual weight) between the regression line and the CI highest when the CI is narrow and dark. As the CI fade near the edges, so does the contrast with the regression line. This is a small adjustment, but I like it because it is so simple and it makes the graph much nicer. (see “visually_weighted_fill_reverse” attached). My posted code has been updated to do this automatically.


2. You and your readers didn’t like that the edges of the filled CI were so sharp and arbitrary. But I didn’t like that the contrast between the spaghetti lines and the background</p><p>6 0.87735844 <a title="619-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-02-Information_is_good.html">176 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-02-Information is good</a></p>

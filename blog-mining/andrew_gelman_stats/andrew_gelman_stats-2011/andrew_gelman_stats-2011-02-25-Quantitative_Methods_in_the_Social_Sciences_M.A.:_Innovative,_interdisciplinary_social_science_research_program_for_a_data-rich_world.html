<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>3 0.14113525 <a title="591-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-08-More_on_essentialism.html">1107 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-08-More on essentialism</a></p>

I’m with  Zipfian Academy  – we’re launching next week as the first 12-week immersive program to teach data science. The program combines the hard and soft skills of data science with introductions to the data science community out here in San Francisco.


The launch will be covered by a couple big tech blogs, but we’d love to offer the opportunity to blog about it to some smaller and well-respected data science blogs like yours. 
  
I don’t know anything about this but I took a look at the website and it looks pretty cool.

Large and complex datasets are becoming prevalent in the social and behavioral sciences and statistical methods are crucial for the analysis and interpretation of such data. The Chapman & Hall/CRC Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series aims to capture new developments in statistical methodology with particular relevance to applications in the social and behavioral sciences. It seeks to promote appropriate use of statistical, econometric and psychometric methods in these applied sciences by publishing a broad range of monographs, textbooks and handbooks.


The scope of the series is wide, including applications of statistical methodology in sociology, psychology, economics, education, marketing research, political science, criminology, public policy, demography, survey methodology and official statistics. The titles included in the series are designed to appeal to applied statisticians, as well as students, researchers and practitioners from the</p><p>3 0.68680012 <a title="591-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc_positions_at_Microsoft_Research_%E2%80%93_NYC.html">1630 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc positions at Microsoft Research – NYC</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A  link  from Tyler Cowen led me to this  long blog article  by Razib Khan, discussing some recent genetic findings on human origins in the context of the past twenty-five years of research and popularization of science.
  

 
I don’t know much about human origins (beyond my ooh-that’s-cool reactions to exhibits at the Natural History Museum, my general statistician’s skepticism at various over-the-top claims I’ve heard over the years about “mitochondrial Eve” and the like, and various bits I’ve read over the years regarding when people came over to Australia, America, etc.), but what particularly interested me about Khan’s article was his discussion about the various controversies among scientists, his own reactions when reading and thinking about these issues as they were happening (Khan was a student at the time), and the interaction between science and political ideology.
 
There’s a limit to how far you can go with this sort of cultural criticism of science, and Khan realizes this</p><p>5 0.66754144 <a title="591-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Job_openings_in_multilevel_modeling_in_Bristol%2C_England.html">202 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Job openings in multilevel modeling in Bristol, England</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sciencedaily has posted an article titled  Apes Unwilling to Gamble When Odds Are Uncertain :
  

The apes readily distinguished between the different probabilities of winning: they gambled a lot when there was a 100 percent chance, less when there was a 50 percent chance, and only rarely when there was no chance In some trials, however, the experimenter didn’t remove a lid from the bowl, so the apes couldn’t assess the likelihood of winning a banana The odds from the covered bowl were identical to those from the risky option: a 50 percent chance of getting the much sought-after banana. But apes of both species were less likely to choose this ambiguous option.

   

Like humans, they showed “ambiguity aversion” — preferring to gamble more when they knew the odds than when they didn’t. Given some of the other differences between chimps and bonobos, Hare and Rosati had expected to find the bonobos to be more averse to ambiguity, but that didn’t turn out to be the case.

<p>Introduction: Hear me interviewed on the topic  here .
 
P.S.  The interview was fine but I donâ&euro;&trade;t agree with everything on the linked website.  For example,  this  bit:
  
Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.  Global warming has many of the characteristics of a popular delusion, an irrational fear or cause that is embraced by millions of people because, well, it is believed by millions of people!
  
All right, then.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94779903 <a title="591-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-25-Quantitative_Methods_in_the_Social_Sciences_M.A.%3A_Innovative%2C_interdisciplinary_social_science_research_program_for_a_data-rich_world.html">591 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-25-Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences M.A.: Innovative, interdisciplinary social science research program for a data-rich world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 12 years ago Greg Wawro, Sy Spilerman, and I started a M.A. program here in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences, jointly between the departments of history, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and statistics.  We created a bunch of new features for the program, including an interdisciplinary course based on  this book .
  

 
And here’s their new logo:
 
 
 
Don’t blame me for the pie-chart motif!  Seriously, though, the program is great.  I’m proud to have gotten it started, and I’m impressed by the progress that Chris Weiss and others have made in expanding the program during the past decade.</p><p>4 0.94604695 <a title="591-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-04-Bayesian_Learning_via_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics.html">1443 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-04-Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Burak Bayramli writes:
  
In  this paper  by Sunjin Ahn, Anoop Korattikara, and Max Welling and  this paper  by Welling and Yee Whye The, there are some arguments on big data and the use of MCMC. Both papers have suggested improvements to speed up MCMC computations. I was wondering what your thoughts were, especially on this paragraph:

 
When a dataset has a billion data-cases (as is not uncommon these days) MCMC algorithms will not even have generated a single (burn-in) sample when a clever learning algorithm based on stochastic gradients may already be making fairly good predictions. In fact, the intriguing results of Bottou and Bousquet (2008) seem to indicate that in terms of “number of bits learned per unit of computation”, an algorithm as simple as stochastic gradient descent is almost optimally efficient. We therefore argue that for Bayesian methods to remain useful in an age when the datasets grow at an exponential rate, they need to embrace the ideas of the stochastic optimiz</p><p>5 0.92826879 <a title="591-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-45%25_hitting%2C_25%25_fielding%2C_25%25_pitching%2C_and_100%25_not_telling_us_how_they_did_it.html">942 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-45% hitting, 25% fielding, 25% pitching, and 100% not telling us how they did it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A University of Delaware press release  reports :
  
This month, the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports will feature the article “An Estimate of How Hitting, Pitching, Fielding, and Base-stealing Impact Team Winning Percentages in Baseball.”  In it, University of Delaware Prof. Charles Pavitt of the Department of Communication defines the perfect “formula” for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams to use to build the ultimate winning team.


Pavitt found hitting accounts for more than 45 percent of teams’ winning records, fielding for 25 percent and pitching for 25 percent. And that the impact of stolen bases is greatly overestimated.


He crunched hitting, pitching, fielding and base-stealing records for every MLB team over a 48-year period from 1951-1998 with a method no other researcher has used in this area. In statistical parlance, he used a conceptual decomposition of offense and defense into its component parts and then analyzed recombinations of the parts in intuitively mea</p><p>6 0.92678905 <a title="591-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-03-On_house_arrest_for_p-hacking.html">2049 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-03-On house arrest for p-hacking</a></p>

2.  You make your move and run around the house.  The other player has to move before you return, but he does not have to wait until you return to start running.  He can start running once he’s moved.  Then when you get back you have to move before he gets back, but you can start to run once you’ve moved, etc.

When I played with my brother, we had it that if you managed to lap someone while running around the house, then you got an additional move. This means that if you had the option to take the king on your additional move, you could, and doing so won you the game. He was fitter at the time so he slipped in two additional moves over the course of the game. I still won :) I am much better at him at chess though, so I’m sure he would have beaten me had we been more even.

<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus  writes ,
  
An algorithm that is good at chess won’t help parsing sentences, and one that parses sentences likely won’t be much help playing chess.
  
That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.  I’d much rather have had twice as much detail on the first part of the life and then had the post-1972 era compr</p><p>6 0.23098253 <a title="615-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-30-I_suppose_it%E2%80%99s_too_late_to_add_Turing%E2%80%99s_run-around-the-house-chess_to_the_2012_London_Olympics%3F.html">1290 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-30-I suppose it’s too late to add Turing’s run-around-the-house-chess to the 2012 London Olympics?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>6 0.81365424 <a title="615-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-08-Of_parsing_and_chess.html">1847 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-08-Of parsing and chess</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces. The result is a series of elegant graph problems where the viable paths change with each move of your opponent. To draw an analogy with chess, imagine if moving your knight could allow your opponent’s bishop to move like a rook. Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?


Part of the problem is that we learn the game as children so we tend to think of it as a children’s game. We focus on how simple the rules are and miss how much complexity and subtlety you can get out of those ru</p><p>2 0.88982332 <a title="615-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-17-ff.html">418 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-17-ff</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can somebody please fix the pdf reader so that it can correctly render “ff” when I cut and paste?  This comes up when I’m copying sections of articles on to the blog.
 
Thank you.
 
P.S.  I googled “ff pdf” but no help there.
 
P.P.S.  It’s a problem with “fi” also.
 
 P.P.P.S.   Yes, I know about ligatures.  But, if  you  already knew about ligatures, and  I  already know about ligatures, then presumably the pdf people already know about ligatures too.  So why can’t their clever program, which can already find individual f’s, also find the ff’s and separate them?  I assume it’s not so simple but I don’t quite understand why not.</p><p>3 0.84358507 <a title="615-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-04-To_commenters_who_are_trying_to_sell_something.html">839 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-04-To commenters who are trying to sell something</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the new examples for the third edition of Bayesian Data Analysis is a spell-checking story.   Here it is  (just start at 2/3 down on the first page, with “Spelling correction”).
 
I like this example—it demonstrates the Bayesian algebra, also gives a sense of the way that probability models (both “likelihood” and “prior”) are constructed from existing assumptions and data.  The models aren’t just specified as a mathematical exercise, they represent some statement about reality.  And the problem is close enough to our experience that we can consider ways in which the model can be criticized and improved, all in a simple example that has only three possibilities.</p><p>6 0.83392155 <a title="615-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians_vs._everybody_else.html">582 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians vs. everybody else</a></p>

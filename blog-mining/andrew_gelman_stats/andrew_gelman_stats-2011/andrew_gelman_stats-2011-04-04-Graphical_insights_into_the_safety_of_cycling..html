<p>Introduction: Freakonomics  reports :
  

A reader in Norway named Christian Sørensen examined the height statistics for all players in the 2010 World Cup and found an interesting anomaly: there seemed to be unnaturally few players listed at 169, 179, and 189 centimeters and an apparent surplus of players who were 170, 180, and 190 centimeters tall (roughly 5-foot-7 inches, 5-foot-11 inches, and 6-foot-3 inches, respectively). Here’s the data:

  
 
 
It’s not costless to communicate numbers. When we compare “eighty” (6 characters) vs “seventy-nine” (12 characters) – how much information are we gaining by twice the number of characters? Do people really care about height at +-0.5 cm or is +-1 cm enough?
 
It’s harder to communicate odd numbers (“three” vs four or two, “seven” vs “six” or “eight”, “nine” vs “ten”) than even ones. As language tends to follow our behaviors, people have been doing it for a long time. We remember the shorter description of a quantity.

 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>4 0.086883374 <a title="646-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-My_upcoming_talk_for_the_data_visualization_meetup.html">1450 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-My upcoming talk for the data visualization meetup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody asked me to speak sometime at a data visualization meetup.  I think I spoke there a year or two ago but I could do it again.  Last time I spoke on  Infovis vs Statistical Graphics , this time I could just go thru the choices involved in a few zillion graphs I’ve published over the years, to give a sense of the options and choices involved in graphical communication.  For this talk there would be no single theme (except, perhaps, my usual “Graphs as comparisons,” “All of statistics as comparisons,” and “Exploratory data analysis as hypothesis testing”), just a bunch of open discussion about what I tried, why I tried it, what worked and what didn’t work, etc.  I’ve discussed these sorts of decisions on occasion (and am now writing a paper with Yair about some of this for our voting models), but I’ve never tried to make a talk out of it before.  Could be fun.</p><p>5 0.085533731 <a title="646-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-The_sort_of_thing_that_gives_technocratic_reasoning_a_bad_name.html">993 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-The sort of thing that gives technocratic reasoning a bad name</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 1.  Freakonomics  characterizes  drunk driving as an example of “the human tendency to worry about rare problems that are unlikely to happen.”
 
2.  The CDC  reports , “Alcohol-impaired drivers are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.”
 
No offense to the tenured faculty at the University of Chicago, but I’m going with the CDC on this one. 
   
P.S.  The Freakonomics blog deserves to be dinged another time, not just for claiming, based on  implausible assumptions  and making the all-else-equal  fallacy  that “drunk walking is 8 times more likely to result in your death than drunk driving” but for presenting this weak inference as a fact rather than as a speculation.
 
When doing “Freakonomics,” you can be counterintuitive, or you can be sensible, but it’s hard to be both. I mean, sure, sometimes you can be. But there’s a tradeoff, and in this case, they’re choosing to push the envelope on counterintuitiveness.</p><p>6 0.077314563 <a title="646-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-30-More_on_problems_with_surveys_estimating_deaths_in_war_zones.html">12 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-30-More on problems with surveys estimating deaths in war zones</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Amy Cohen points me to  this blog  by Jim Manzi, who writes:
  
 
 Ezra Klein  and a variety of other thoughtful liberal bloggers have been pointing to an Economic Policy Institute analysis that they claim demonstrates that Wisconsin’s public employees, even after adjusting for benefits and hours worked, face a ” compensation penalty of 5% for choosing to work in the public sector.” Unfortunately, when you get under the hood, the study shows no such thing. . . . reading the  actual paper  by Jeffrey H. Keefe is instructive. Keefe took a representative sample of Wisconsin workers, and built a regression model that relates “fundamental personal characteristics and labor market skills” to compensation, and then compared public to private sector employees, after “controlling” for these factors. As far as I can see, the factors adjusted for were: years of education; years of experience; gender; race; ethnicity; disability; size of organization where the employee works; and, hours worked per</p><p>6 0.77691776 <a title="646-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-How_can_news_reporters_avoid_making_mistakes_when_reporting_on_technical_issues%3F__Or%2C_Data_used_to_justify_%E2%80%9CData_Used_to_Justify_Health_Savings_Can_Be_Shaky%E2%80%9D_can_be_shaky.html">66 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-How can news reporters avoid making mistakes when reporting on technical issues?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  hypothesizes  a “dogmatism portfolio” or a “quota of dogmatism”:  in his words,
  
If you’re very dogmatic in one area, you may be less dogmatic in others.
  
OK, well “may be” is pretty vague.  There’s not really anything to disagree with, yet.  But then Cowen continues:
  
 
There’s a lesson here.  If you wish to be a more open-minded thinker, adhere to some extreme and perhaps unreasonable fandoms, the more firmly believed the better and the more obscure the area the better.  This will help fulfill your dogmatism quota, yet without much skewing your more important beliefs.
 

 
He seems to be making a testable prediction here, that levels of dogmatism on two randomly chosen issues should be negatively correlated.  I guess I should call this “almost testable,” as it still requires an issue-by-issue measure of dogmatism.  (Is it dogmatic to believe that there was this guy called Jesus who walked on water . . . or is it dogmatic to say that Jesus  didn’t  walk on water and</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85203886 <a title="646-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-04-Graphical_insights_into_the_safety_of_cycling..html">646 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-04-Graphical insights into the safety of cycling.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?  Obviously, if peo</p><p>3 0.82710755 <a title="646-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-21-Red_state_blue_state%2C_or%2C_states_and_counties_are_not_persons.html">1587 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-21-Red state blue state, or, states and counties are not persons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to  this  news article by Lauren Sandler:
  
Stunningly, the postponement of marriage and parenting — the factors that shrink the birth rate — is the very best predictor of a person’s politics in the United States, over even income and education levels, a Belgian demographer named Ron Lesthaeghe [and coauthor Lisa Neidert]  has discovered . Larger family size in America correlates to early marriage and childbirth, lower women’s employment, and opposition to gay rights — all social factors that lead voters to see red.
  
All the analysis in the linked paper is at the state and county level.  That’s fine but this is not going to tell you what is a “predictor of a person’s politics.”  Cowen labels his post “Sentences to ponder,” and what I want to ponder is that people are so quick to jump from aggregate to individual patterns.
 
And, yes, I know that aggregate patterns are related to individual patterns but they’re not the same.   In particular, from the evidence we’</p><p>4 0.82098508 <a title="646-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-05-Those_darn_conservative_egalitarians.html">1444 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-05-Those darn conservative egalitarians</a></p>

In your  review  of the Jacobs and Page book, you argued that while there was an open question of whether government could give voters what they wanted in light of the tax increases they might accept, Jacobs and Page were pretty persuasive about targeted tax hikes and specific programs especially against the freeloader view.  Recent discussions, and some focus groups  bear out these points exactly.

<p>Introduction: According to a  New York Times article , cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have a new theory about rational argument: humans didn’t develop it in order to learn about the world, we developed it in order to win arguments with other people. “It was a purely social phenomenon. It evolved to help us convince others and to be careful when others try to convince us.” 
 
Based on the NYT article, it seems that Mercier and Sperber are basically flipping around the traditional argument, which is that humans learned to reason about the world, albeit imperfectly, and learned to use language to convey that reasoning to others.  These guys would suggest that it’s the other way around: we learned to argue with others, and this has gradually led to the ability to actually make (and recognize) sound arguments, but only indirectly.

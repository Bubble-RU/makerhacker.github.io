<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>5 0.18605395 <a title="884-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-14-In_an_introductory_course%2C_when_does_learning_occur%3F.html">277 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-14-In an introductory course, when does learning occur?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that September has arrived, it’s time for us to think teaching.   Here’s something  from Andrew Heckler and Eleanor Sayre.  Heckler writes:
  
The article describes a project studying the performance of university level students taking an intro physics course. Every week for ten weeks we took 1/10th of the students (randomly selected only once) and gave them the same set of questions relevant to the course. This allowed us to plot the evolution of average performance in the class during the quarter.  We can then determine when learning occurs: For example, do they learn the material in a relevant lecture or lab or homework? Since we had about 350 students taking the course, we could get some reasonable stats.


In particular, you might be interested in Figure 10 (page 774) which shows student performance day-by-day on a particular question.  The performance does not change directly after lecture, but rather only when the homework was due.

<p>Introduction: Michael Landy writes:
  
I’m in Psych and Center for Neural Science and I’m teaching a doctoral course this term in methods in psychophysics (never mind the details) at the tail end of which I’m planning on at least 2 lectures on Bayesian parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison. So far, all the readings I have are a bit too obscure and either glancing (bits of machine-learning books: Bishop, MacKay) or too low-level. The only useful reference I’ve got is an application of these methods (a methods article of mine in a Neuroscience Methods journal). The idea is to give them a decent idea of both estimation (Jeffries priors, marginals of the posterior over the parameters) and model comparison (cross-validation, AIC, BIC, full-blown Bayesian model posterior comparisons, Bayes factor, Occam factor, blah blah blah).


So: have you any suggestions for articles or chapters that might be suitable (yes, I’m aware you have an entire book that’s obviously relevant)?

<p>Introduction: Jemes Keirstead sends along  this infographic :
 
 
 
He hates it:
  
First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.e. the pinch point in the glass) is actually 3-5 years in the future and the past sand includes “up to three years” in the future.  Then there are the percentages which are appear to represent a vertical distance, not volume of sand or width of the hourglass.  Add to that a strange color scheme in which green goes from dark to light to dark again.


I know January’s not even finished yet, but surely a competitor for worst infographic of 2013?
  
Keirstead doesn’t even comment on what I see as the worst aspect of the graph, which is that the “3-5 years” band is the narrowest on the graph, but expressed as a per-year rate it is actually the  highest  of all the percentages.  The hourglass visualization does the astounding feat of taking the period where the executives expect the highest rate of change and presenting it as a minimum in the graph.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96275568 <a title="884-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-My_course_this_fall_on_Bayesian_Computation.html">884 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-My course this fall on Bayesian Computation</a></p>

Class meets Wed 9:30-12, Mudd Hall 1106B
 
Research topics.  We are working on the following Bayesian computation projects: 
-	Automated adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo 
-	Penalized maximum likelihood for multilevel models 
-	Weakly informative prior distributions 
-	Multilevel regression and poststratification 
-	Missing-data imputation using iterative regressions 
-	Automating graphical displays for checking and understanding models
 
Skills.  In the homeworks, you will work in R to: 
-	Program the following Markov chain samplers:  Gibbs, Metropolis, Metropolis-Hastings, slice, Langevin, Hamiltonian, also variational Bayes 
-	Make statistical graphs and perform posterior predictive checks 
-	Check Bayesian inference programs using fake-data simulation 
   
All readings, class notes, and homeworks will be posted as pdfs at http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/bayecomputation

<p>Introduction: Solomon Hsiang shares some bad news:
 
   
 
   
  
Persistently reduced labor productivity may be one of the largest economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change. . . .


Two percent per degree Celsius . . . That’s the magic number for how worker productivity responds to warm/hot temperatures.


In  my 2010 PNAS paper , I [Hsiang] found that labor-intensive sectors of national economies decreased output by roughly 2.4% per degree C and argued that this looked suspiously like it came from reductions in worker output. Using a totally different method and dataset, Matt Neidell and Josh Graff Zivin found that labor supply in micro data fell by 1.8% per degree C.  Both responses kicked in at around 26C.


Chris Sheehan just sent me  this NYT article on air conditioning , where they mention this neat natural experiment:

 
[I]n the past year, [Japan] became an unwitting laboratory to study even more extreme air-conditioning abstinence, and the results have not been encouraging.

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010. The data available at this writing indicate the that Democrats will win 211 seats, a loss of 45 from the 2008 o</p><p>5 0.94599408 <a title="884-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-23-AI_Stats_conference_on_Stan_etc..html">1911 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-23-AI Stats conference on Stan etc.</a></p>

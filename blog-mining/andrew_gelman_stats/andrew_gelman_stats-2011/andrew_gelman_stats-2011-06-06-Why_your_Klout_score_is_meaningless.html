<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>4 0.091009505 <a title="748-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-Happy_news_on_happiness%3B_what_can_we_believe%3F.html">1305 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-Happy news on happiness; what can we believe?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharon Jayson  writes :
  
The conventional wisdom that’s developed over the past few decades — based on early research — has said parents are less happy, more depressed and have less-satisfying marriages than their childless counterparts.


But now, two new studies presented as part of the Population Association of America’s annual meeting suggest that earlier findings in several studies weren’t so clear-cut and may, in fact, be flawed. The newer analyses presented this week use analytical methods based on data from almost 130,000 adults around the globe — including more than 52,000 parents — and the conclusions aren’t so grim. They say that parents today may indeed be happier than non-parents and that parental happiness levels — while they do drop — don’t dip below the levels they were before having children. . . .


The other study, of some 120,000 adults from two nationally representative surveys between 1972-2008, finds that parents were indeed less happy than non-parents in the d</p><p>5 0.088234797 <a title="748-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-02-Helpful_on_happiness.html">1360 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-02-Helpful on happiness</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.

If you’re used to Google upending conventional wisdom, then yesterday’s  interview with Laszlo Bock in the New York Times  did not disappoint. Google has determined that test scores and transcripts are useless because they don’t predict performance among its employees. . . .


I [Loken] am going to assume they’re well aware of the limits of their claim, and instead I’m going say that as readers of the interview we should not lose sight of a fundamental fact -

 
Across a wide variety of employment settings, one of the most robust findings in organizational psychology is that tests of cognitive ability are strong predictors of job performance. If Google has found otherwise, what they have found is that grades and test scores are not predictive of performance at Google. In general, in the workplace tests are still highly predictive of success.

The recent events in Egypt raise an interesting statistical question.   It is of course common for news stations like CNN to interview various officials and policy experts to find out what is likely to happen next. The obvious response of people like us is why ask such people when they didn’t foresee a month ago that these dynamic events were about to happen.  One would instead like to hear from those experts that did predict that something was about to happen in Tunisia, and Egypt, and Jordan, and maybe Yemen, etc.  Well, are there such people?  My friend Bob Burton says that of course one can find such people in the sense that they made such predictions, but that is like finding counties that have voted for the President in the last five elections, big deal, or psychics that predicted the last assassination, again big deal.  There is a good deal of truth in that.  However, it seems like we do a little better.  There are two points to make.

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>2 0.91942614 <a title="748-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-11-Continuing_conflict_over_conflict_statistics.html">1798 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-11-Continuing conflict over conflict statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alex Braunstein  writes  about Klout, a company which measures Twitter/Facebook influence:
  
As a Ph D statistician and search quality engineer, I [Braunstein] know a lot about how to properly measure things. In the past few months I’ve become an active Twitter user and very interested in measuring the influence of individuals. Klout provides a way to measure influence on Twitter using a score also called Klout. The range is 0 to 100. Light users score below 20, regular users around 30, and celebrities start around 75. Naturally, I was intrigued by the Klout measurement, but a careful analysis led to some serious issues with the score. . . .
  
Braunstein continues with some comparisons of different twitter-users and how their Klout scores don’t make much sense.  I don’t really see the point of the Klout scores in the first place:  I guess they’re supposed to be a quick measure to use in pricing advertising?  Whatever, I don’t really care.
 
What did interest me was a remark on Brauns</p><p>4 0.88887739 <a title="748-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-17-Stan_and_RStan_1.1.0.html">1627 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-17-Stan and RStan 1.1.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt writes:
  
The hype surrounding Big Data and Data Science is at a fever pitch with promises to solve the worldâ&euro;&trade;s business and social problems, large and small. How accurate or misleading is this message? How is it helping or damaging people, and which people? What opportunities exist for data nerds and entrepreneurs that examine the larger issues with a skeptical view?


 This Meetup  focuses on mathematical, ethical, and business aspects of data from a skeptical perspective. Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling. We will take deep dives into models in the fields of Data Science, statistics, financial engineering, and economics.

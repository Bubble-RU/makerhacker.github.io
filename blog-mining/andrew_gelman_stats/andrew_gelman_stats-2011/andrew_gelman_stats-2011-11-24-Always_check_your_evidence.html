<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.

<p>Introduction: The pre-NYT David Brooks liked to make fun of the NYT.  Here’s one  from 1997 :
  
I’m not sure I’d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I’d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.


And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man—Thomas Arena—who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .


These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan’s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.

<p>Introduction: A Brooks op-ed  in the New York Times (circulation approximately 1.5 million):
  
People at the extremes are happier than political moderates. . . . none, it seems, are happier than the Tea Partiers . . .
  
 Jay Livingston  on his blog (circulation approximately 0 (rounding to the nearest million)), giving data from the 2009-2010 General Social Survey, which is the usual place people turn to for population data on happiness of Americans:
  
   


The GSS does not offer “bitter” or “Tea Party” as choices, but extreme conservatives are nearly three times as likely as others to be “not too happy.”
  
Livingston reports that the sample size for “Extremely Conservative” here is 80.  Thus the standard error for that green bar on the right is approx sqrt(0.3*0.7/80)=0.05.
 
So how could Brooks have made such a mistake?  I can think of two possibilities:
 
1.  Brooks has some other data source that directly addresses the happiness of supporters of the Tea Party movement.
 
2.  Brooks looked a</p><p>5 0.17548421 <a title="1025-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-20-Education_could_use_some_systematic_evaluation.html">1271 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-20-Education could use some systematic evaluation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Brooks  writes : 
  
  
There’s an atmosphere of grand fragility hanging over America’s colleges. The grandeur comes from the surging application rates, the international renown, the fancy new dining and athletic facilities. The fragility comes from the fact that colleges are charging more money, but it’s not clear how much actual benefit they are providing. . . .


This is an unstable situation. At some point, parents are going to decide that $160,000 is too high a price if all you get is an empty credential and a fancy car-window sticker.


One part of the solution is found in three little words: value-added assessments. Colleges have to test more to find out how they’re doing.
  
I agree with that last paragraph.  Eric Loken and I  said  as much in the context of statistics teaching, but the principle of measuring outcomes makes sense more generally.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko is  irritated  by the Times’s refusal to retract a recounting of a hoax regarding Dickens and Dostoevsky.  All I can say is, the Times refuses to retract mistakes of fact that are far more current than that!   See here  for two examples that particularly annoyed me, to the extent that I contacted various people at the Times but ran into refusals to retract.
 
I guess a daily newspaper publishes so much material that they can’t be expected to run a retraction every time they publish something false, even when such things are brought to their attention.
 
Speaking of corrections, I wonder if later editions of the Samuelson economics textbook discussed their notorious  graph  predicting Soviet economic performance.  The easiest thing would be just to remove the graph, but I think it would be a better economics lesson to discuss the error!
 
Similarly, I think the NYT would do well to run an article on their Dickens-Dostoevsky mistake, along with a column by Arthur Brooks on how</p><p>5 0.7874763 <a title="1025-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-28-Different_modes_of_discourse.html">1743 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-28-Different modes of discourse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Political/business negotiation vs. scholarly communication.
 
In a negotiation you hold back, you only make concessions if you have to or in exchange for something else.  In scholarly communication you look for your own mistakes, you volunteer information to others, and if someone points out a mistake, you learn from it.  (Just a couple days ago, in fact, someone sent me an email showing a problem with bayesglm.  I ran and altered his code, and it turned out we had a problem.  Based on this information, Yu-Sung found and fixed the code.  I was grateful to be informed of the problem.)
 
Not all scholarly exchange goes like this, but that’s the ideal.  In contrast, openness and transparency are not ideals in politics and business; in many cases they’re not even desired.  If Barack Obama and John Boehner are negotiating on the budget, would it be appropriate for one of them to just start off the negotiations by making a bunch of concessions for free?  No, of course not.  Negotiation doesn</p><p>6 0.74196523 <a title="1025-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-18-Mertz%E2%80%99s_reply_to_Unz%E2%80%99s_response_to_Mertz%E2%80%99s_comments_on_Unz%E2%80%99s_article.html">1768 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-18-Mertz’s reply to Unz’s response to Mertz’s comments on Unz’s article</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>2 0.98831409 <a title="1025-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Where_are_the_larger-than-life_athletes%3F.html">1115 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Where are the larger-than-life athletes?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.

<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

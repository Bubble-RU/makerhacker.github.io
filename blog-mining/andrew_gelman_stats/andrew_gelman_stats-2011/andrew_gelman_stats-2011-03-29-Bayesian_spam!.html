<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:
  
Participants in the Health Prize challenge will be given a data set comprised of the de-identified medical records of 100,000 individuals who are members of HPN.  The teams will then need to predict the hospitalization of a set percentage of those members who went to the hospital during the year following the start date, and do so with a defined accuracy rate.  The winners will receive the $3 million prize. . . . the contest is designed to spur involvement by others involved in analytics, such as those involved in data mining and predictive modeling who may not currently be working in health care.  “We believe that doing so will bring innovative thinking to health analytics and may allow us to solve at</p><p>5 0.1580434 <a title="635-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-Note_to_%E2%80%9CCigarettes%E2%80%9D.html">132 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-Note to “Cigarettes”</a></p>

I put it in the spam file manually.  If you’d like to participate in blog discussion in the future, please refrain from including spam links.  Thank you.

<p>Introduction: I have to go through the inbox to approve new comments.  When I set to auto-approve, I get overwhelmed with spam.  As is, I still get spam but it’s manageable.

It’s incoherent but it doesn’t look computer-generated.  My guess is that the law firm in Massachusetts hired a company that promised to raise their Google rankings, and that this company hired some non-English-speaking foreigners to search through the web and write some spam comments.  If anyone actually reads the comments, they might get the impression that this law firm is staffed by illiterates . . . but, as we all know, nobody reads blog comments!

Barry Rowlingson gave an interesting talk at UseR 2011, “Why R-help must die!” He suggested the Q-and-A type sites Stack Overflow (on programming) and Cross Validated (on statistics), both part of Stack Exchange.
  
I haven’t used R-help recently but I do occasionally send people there.  Just to see what was going on there, I  clicked on over , did a little searching, and found  this delight  from a renowned professor of R.  There’s something about the “please” there that just makes it all that much more special.  (In contrast, the advice  here  to “please do your homework” just seems rude.
 
I have a larger (or maybe smaller) point to make, though, which is about the silliness of advice to “read the damn manual” etc.
 
Several years ago I read a fascinating book called City by William Whyte.  He and his students had gone around various public places in NYC and observed how people actually behaved—how they walked, sit, stood, and interacted.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching OpenDataLatinoamerica.org, a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.


We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain. Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight International Journalism Fellows.

<p>Introduction: Today’s item mixes two of my favorite themes in a horrible way, sort of like a Reese’s Cup but combining brussels sprouts and liver instead of peanut butter and chocolate.  In this case, the disturbing flavors that go together are  plagiarism  (you know what that is) and  the publication filter  (the  idea  that there should be very stringent standards for criticizing something, once it happens to be published somewhere).
 
 The copyist 
 
The first ingredient comes from Matthew Whitaker, an Arizona State University Foundation Professor of History who has a deplorable record of  copying material from other writers without attribution .
 
For convenience, I’ll  reproduce  an example here:
 
      
 
On the plus side; Whitaker removed the cliche’d phrase, “undisputed rulers of the roost” when copying from the online encyclopedia; on the downside, I don’t know what he was thinking when he rendered “Conservatives” with a capital letter.

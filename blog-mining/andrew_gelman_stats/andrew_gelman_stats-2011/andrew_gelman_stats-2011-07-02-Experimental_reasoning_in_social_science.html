Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.

<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points to an  excellent article  on statistical experimentation by Ron Kohavi, Alex Deng, Brian Frasca, Roger Longbotham, Toby Walker, Ya Xu, a group of software engineers (I presume) at Microsoft.  Kohavi et al. write:
  
Online controlled experiments are often utilized to make data-driven decisions at Amazon, Microsoft . . . deployment and mining of online controlled experiments at scale—thousands of experiments now—has taught us many lessons.
  
The paper is well written and has excellent examples (unfortunately the substantive topics are unexciting things like clicks and revenue per user, but the general principles remain important).  The ideas will be familiar to anyone with experience in practical statistics but don’t always make it into textbooks or courses, so I think many people could learn a lot from this article.

<p>Introduction: 1.   Causality and statistical learning  (Wed 12 Feb 2014, 16:00, at University of Bristol):
  
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences. There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it. As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data. In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification, yet must learn from available information.
  
This is a good one.  They laughed their asses off when I did it in Ann Arbor.  But it has serious stuff too.  As George Carlin (or, for that matter, John or Brad) might say, it’s funny because it’s true.   Here  are some old slides, but I plan to mix in a bit of new material.

<p>Introduction: From the classic Box, Hunter, and Hunter book.  The point of the saying is pretty clear, I think:  There are things you learn from perturbing a system that you’ll never find out from any amount of passive observation.  This is not always true–sometimes “nature” does the experiment for you–but I think it represents an important insight.
 
I’m currently writing (yet another) review article on causal inference and am planning use this quote.
 
P.S.  I find it helpful to write these reviews for a similar reason that I like to blog on certain topics over and over, each time going a bit further (I hope) than the time before.  Beyond the benefit of communicating my recommendations to new audiences, writing these sorts of reviews gives me an excuse to explore my thoughts in more rigor.
 
P.P.S.  In the original version of this blog entry, I correctly attributed the quote to Box but I incorrectly remembered it as “No understanding without manipulation.”  Karl Broman (see comment below) gave me</p><p>6 0.17818524 <a title="785-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-26-New_research_journal_on_observational_studies.html">2268 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-26-New research journal on observational studies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  a recent article , “Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems,” by fisheries researchers George Sugihara, Robert May, Hao Ye, Chih-hao Hsieh, Ethan Deyle, Michael Fogarty, and Stephan Munch.
 
I don’t know anything about ecology research but I could imagine this method being useful in that field.  I can’t see the approach doing much in political science, where I think their stated goal of “identifying causal networks” is typically irrelevant.
 
That said, if you replace the word “causality” by “predictability” everywhere in the paper, it starts to make a lot more sense.  As they write, they are working within “a framework that uses predictability as opposed to correlation to identify causation between time-series variables.”  Setting causation aside, predictability is an important topic in itself.  The search for patterns of predictability in complex structures may motivate causal hypotheses that can be studied more directly, using more traditional statis</p><p>3 0.8601371 <a title="785-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-New_journal_on_causal_inference.html">879 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-New journal on causal inference</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judea Pearl is starting an (online) Journal of Causal Inference.  The first issue is planned for Fall 2011 and the  website  is now open for submissions.  Here’s the background (from Pearl):
  
Existing discipline-specific journals tend to bury causal analysis in the language and methods of traditional statistical methodologies, creating the inaccurate impression that causal questions can be handled by routine methods of regression, simultaneous equations or logical implications, and glossing over the special ingredients  needed for causal analysis.  In contrast, Journal of Causal Inference highlights both the uniqueness and interdisciplinary nature of causal research.


In addition to significant original research articles, Journal of Causal Inference also welcomes: 
1) Submissions that synthesize and assess cross-disciplinary methodological research 
2) Submissions that discuss the history of the causal inference field and its philosophical underpinnings 
3) Unsolicited short communi</p><p>4 0.79831636 <a title="785-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-08-Understanding_Simpson%E2%80%99s_paradox_using_a_graph.html">2286 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-08-Understanding Simpson’s paradox using a graph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein pointed me to  this  post by Michael Nielsen on how to teach Simpson’s paradox.
 
I don’t know if Nielsen (and others) are aware that people have developed some snappy graphical methods for displaying Simpson’s paradox (and, more generally, aggregation issues).  We do some this in our Red State Blue State book, but before that was the BK plot,  named by Howard Wainer  after a 2001 paper by Stuart Baker and Barnett Kramer, although in apparently appeared earlier in a 1987 paper by Jeon, Chung, and Bae, and doubtless was made by various other people before then.
 
Here’s Wainer’s graphical explication from 2002 (adapted from Baker and Kramer’s 2001 paper):
 
 
 
   
Here’s the version from our 2007 article (with Boris Shor, Joe Bafumi, and David Park):
 
 
 
But I recommend  Wainer’s article  (linked to above) as the first thing to read on the topic of presenting aggregation paradoxes in a clear and grabby way.

<p>Introduction: As a statistician, I was trained to think of randomized experimentation as representing the gold standard of knowledge in the social sciences, and, despite having seen occasional arguments to the contrary, I still hold that view, expressed pithily by Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) that “To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it.”
 
At the same time, in my capacity as a social scientist, I’ve published many applied research papers, almost none of which have used experimental data.
 
In the present article, I’ll address the following questions:
 
1.  Why do I agree with the consensus characterization of randomized experimentation as a gold standard?
 
2.  Given point 1 above, why does almost all my research use observational data?
 
In confronting these issues, we must consider some general issues in the strategy of social science research. We also take from the psychology methods literature a more nuanced perspective that considers several differen</p><p>2 0.9745211 <a title="785-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-Attractive_but_hard-to-read_graph_could_be_made_much_much_better.html">670 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-Attractive but hard-to-read graph could be made much much better</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  shares  this graph from the  Economist :
 


 

 
 

I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:
 
 
Average Hours Per Day Spent in Each Activity

           Work,   Unpaid  Eating, Personal
Country    study    work  sleeping   care   Leisure  Other

France       4        3       11       1       2       2
Germany      4        3       10       1       3       3
Japan        6        2       10       1       2       2

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>4 0.97097224 <a title="785-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-18-Continuing_efforts_to_justify_false_%E2%80%9Cdeath_panels%E2%80%9D_claim.html">284 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-18-Continuing efforts to justify false “death panels” claim</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan  gives the story .
 
Here’s Sarah Palin’s statement introducing the now-notorious phrase:
  
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s “death panel” so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.
  
And now Brendan:
  
Palin’s language suggests that a “death panel” would determine whether individual patients receive care based on their “level of productivity in society.” This was — and remains — false. Denying coverage at a system level for specific treatments or drugs is not equivalent to “decid[ing], based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society.’”
  
Seems like an open-and-shut case to me.  The “bureaucrats” (I think Palin is referring to “government employees”) are making decisions based on studies of the drug’s effectiveness:

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>6 0.9707247 <a title="785-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-27-A_whole_fleet_of_gremlins%3A__Looking_more_carefully_at_Richard_Tol%E2%80%99s_twice-corrected_paper%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_Economic_Effects_of_Climate_Change%E2%80%9D.html">2350 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-27-A whole fleet of gremlins:  Looking more carefully at Richard Tol’s twice-corrected paper, “The Economic Effects of Climate Change”</a></p>

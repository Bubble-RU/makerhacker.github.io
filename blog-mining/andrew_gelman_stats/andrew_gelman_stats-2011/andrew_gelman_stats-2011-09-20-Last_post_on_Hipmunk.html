As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.

Coincidentally, I had to a buy a flight  right now  so I followed the link and found that, indeed, Hipmunk is about a zillion times easier to use and more impressive than Expedia or even Kayak.

That’s the good news.  Now the bad news.  I wasn’t just playing around with the site.  There was actually a flight I wanted to buy–an itinerary I’d looked into yesterday but hadn’t saved or booked.  I effortlessly set up the request in Hipmunk, scanned its impressive graphical display, and . . . couldn’t find the flight I wanted!  Oh no!  The last ticket must’ve been sold!

<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:
  
Check out the figure below from The Grammar of Graphics. Dan Rope invented this graphic and programmed it in Java in the late 1990′s. We shopped this graph around to Orbitz and Expedia but they weren’t interested.

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago I was cleaning out the closet and found some old unread magazines.  Good stuff.  As we’ve discussed  before , lots of things are better read a few years late.
 
Today I was reading the 18 Nov 2004 issue of the London Review of Books, which contained (among other things) the following:
 
- A review by Jenny Diski of a biography of Stanley Milgram.  Diski appears to want to debunk:
  
Milgram was a whiz at devising sexy experiments, but barely interested in any theoretical basis for them.  They all have the same instant attractiveness of style, and then an underlying emptiness.
  
Huh?  Michael Jordan couldn’t hit the curveball and he was reportedly an easy mark for golf hustlers but that doesn’t diminish his greatness on the basketball court.
 
She also criticizes Milgram for being “no help at all” for solving international disputes.  OK, fine.  I haven’t solved any international disputes either.

<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>6 0.76905948 <a title="917-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-09-The_quest_for_the_holy_graph.html">794 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-09-The quest for the holy graph</a></p>

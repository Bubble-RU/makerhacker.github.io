<p>Introduction: Brendan pointed me to  this  news article by David Pogue promoting a website called  Hipmunk , a sleek competitor to Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, and the like.
 
Coincidentally, I had to a buy a flight  right now  so I followed the link and found that, indeed, Hipmunk is about a zillion times easier to use and more impressive than Expedia or even Kayak.  It’s awesome.  The others aren’t even close.  The display was so clean and effective, I felt like ordering a few flights just for fun.
 
That’s the good news.  Now the bad news.  I wasn’t just playing around with the site.  There was actually a flight I wanted to buy–an itinerary I’d looked into yesterday but hadn’t saved or booked.  I effortlessly set up the request in Hipmunk, scanned its impressive graphical display, and . . . couldn’t find the flight I wanted!  Oh no!  The last ticket must’ve been sold!
 
Just to check, though, I want on good old ugly Expedia.  And my flight was right there!  So I bought it.
 
So, just a quick memo</p><p>3 0.39906538 <a title="573-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk_worked.html">2238 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk worked</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past I’ve categorized Hipmunk as  a really cool flight-finder that doesn’t actually work , as  worse than Expedia , and as  graphics without content .
 
So, I thought it would be only fair to tell you that I bought a flight the other day using Hipmunk and it gave me the same flight as Expedia but at a lower cost (by linking to something called CheapOair, which I hope is legit).  So score one for Hipmunk.</p><p>4 0.35275581 <a title="573-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-20-Last_post_on_Hipmunk.html">917 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-20-Last post on Hipmunk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:
  
Check out the figure below from The Grammar of Graphics. Dan Rope invented this graphic and programmed it in Java in the late 1990′s. We shopped this graph around to Orbitz and Expedia but they weren’t interested. So I</p><p>5 0.32090032 <a title="573-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk_update.html">497 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk update</a></p>

I don’t know anything about the internet biz.  What I’m guessing is that they set up this cool website that is pretty much functional, with the goal of selling it for a few million dollars to Travelocity or Expedia or Kayak.  What I’m wondering is, why haven’t they made the deal already?  Hipmunk’s GUI is great.  The site is useless because it’s missing so many flights, but if you put it in an actual travel site such as Expedia, it would be great.

<p>Introduction: This time on a NY-Cincinnati roundtrip.  Hipmunk could find the individual flights but could not put them together.  In contrast, Expedia got it right the first time.
 
See  here  and  here  for background.  If anybody reading this knows David Pogue, please let him know about this.  A flashy interface is fine, but ultimately what Iâ&euro;&trade;m looking for is a flight at the right place and the right time.</p><p>2 0.85623562 <a title="573-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-06-Statistical_inference_and_the_secret_ballot.html">1407 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-06-Statistical inference and the secret ballot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ring Lardner, Jr.:
  
[In 1936] I was already settled in Southern California, and it may have been that first exercise of the franchise that triggered the FBI surveillance of me that would last for decades.  I had assumed, of course, that I was enjoying the vaunted American privilege of the secret ballot.  On a wall outside my polling place on Wilshire Boulevard, however, was a compilation of the district’s registered voters:  Democrats, a long list of names; Republicans, a somewhat lesser number; and “Declines to State,” one, “Ring W. Lardner, Jr.”  The day after the election, alongside those lists were published the results:  Roosevelt, so many; Landon, so many; Browder, one.</p><p>3 0.85273874 <a title="573-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-09-I_was_at_a_meeting_a_couple_months_ago_._._..html">999 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-09-I was at a meeting a couple months ago . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: . . . and I decided to amuse myself by writing down all the management-speak words I heard:
 
“grappling” 
“early prototypes” 
“technology platform” 
“building block” 
“machine learning” 
“your team” 
“workspace” 
“tagging” 
“data exhaust” 
“monitoring a particular population” 
“collective intelligence” 
“communities of practice” 
“hackathon” 
“human resources . . . technologies”
 
Any one or two or three of these phrases might be fine, but put them all together and what you have is a festival of jargon.  A hackathon, indeed.</p><p>4 0.82504654 <a title="573-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-NYT_shills_for_personal_DNA_tests.html">543 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-NYT shills for personal DNA tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>5 0.81607747 <a title="573-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-13-Indiemapper_makes_thematic_mapping_easy.html">206 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-13-Indiemapper makes thematic mapping easy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.12947483 <a title="913-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-What_goes_around_._._..html">548 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-What goes around . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.  My talk</p><p>5 0.12788358 <a title="913-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: At the time of our last  discussion , Edward Wegman, a statistics professor who has also worked for government research agencies, had been involved in three cases of plagiarism:  a report for the U.S. Congress on climate models, a paper on social networks, a paper on color graphics.
 
Each of the plagiarism stories was slightly different:  the congressional report involved the distorted copying of research by a scientist (Raymond Bradley) whose conclusions Wegman disagreed with, the social networks paper included copied material in its background section, and the color graphics paper included various bits and pieces by others that had been used in old lecture notes.
 
Since then, blogger Deep Climate has  uncovered  another plagiarized article by Wegman, this time an article in a 2005 volume on data mining and data visualization.  Deep Climate writes, “certain sections of Statistical Data Mining rely heavily on lightly edited portions on lectures from Wegman’s statistical data mining c</p><p>4 0.71709329 <a title="913-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-24-A_%28not_quite%29_grand_unified_theory_of_plagiarism%2C_as_applied_to_the_Wegman_case.html">728 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-24-A (not quite) grand unified theory of plagiarism, as applied to the Wegman case</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
Due to my similar interest in  plagiarism , I went to The Human Cultural and Social Landscape session. [The recipient of the American Statistical Association's Founders Award in 2002] gave the first talk in the session instead of Yasmin Said, which was modestly attended (20 or so people) and gave a sociology talk with no numbers — and no attribution to where these ideas (on Afghanistan culture) came from. Would it really have hurt to give the source of this? I’m on board with plain laziness for this one.


I think he may have mentioned a number of his collaborators at the beginning, and all he talked about were cultural customs and backgrounds, no science to speak of.
  
It’s kind of amazing to me that he actually showed up at JSM, but of course if he had any shame, he wouldn’t have repeatedly  stolen  copied without proper attribution in the first place.  It’s not even like Doris Kearns Goodwin who reportedly produced a well-written book out of it!</p><p>2 0.89135623 <a title="913-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-Prior_Selection_for_Vector_Autoregressions.html">1674 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-Prior Selection for Vector Autoregressions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan sends along  this paper  by Domenico Giannone, Michele Lenza, and Giorgio Primiceri:
  
Vector autoregressions are flexible time series models that can capture complex dynamic interrelationships among macroeconomic variables. However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative priors, in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model towards a parsimonious naive benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical modeling. This approach is theoretically grounded, easy to implement, and greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well both in terms of out-of-sample forecastingâ&euro;&rdquo;as well as factor</p><p>3 0.8744297 <a title="913-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-24-%E2%80%9CIncome_can%E2%80%99t_be_used_to_predict_political_opinion%E2%80%9D.html">924 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-24-“Income can’t be used to predict political opinion”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What really irritates me about  this column  (by John Steele Gordon) is not how stupid it is (an article about “millionaires” that switches  within the very same paragraph  between “a nest egg of $1 million” and “a $1 million annual income” without acknowledging the difference between these concepts) or the ignorance it displays (no, it’s not true that “McCain carried the middle class” in 2008—unless by “middle class” you mean “middle class whites”).
 
No, what really ticks me off is that, when the Red State Blue State book was coming out, we pitched a “5 myths” article for the Washington Post, and they turned us down!  Perhaps the rule is:  if it’s in the Opinions section of the paper, it can’t contain any facts?  Or, to be more precise, any facts it contains must be counterbalanced by an equal number of inanities?

<p>Introduction: As we’ve  discussed  on occasion, conditional probability (“Boltzmann statistics,” in physics jargon) is false at the atomic level.  (It’s false at the macroscopic level too, but with discrepancies too small to be detected directly most of the time.)  Occasionally I’ve speculated on how quantum probability (that is, the laws of uncertainty that hold in the real world) might be applied to social science research.
 
I’ve made no progress but remain intrigued by the idea.
 
Chris Zorn told me he recently went to a  meeting  on applications of non-Kolmogorovian / quantum probability to social & human phenomena.   Here’s  his paper (with Charles Smith), “Some Quantum-Like Features of Mass Politics in Two-Party Systems,” which begins:
  
We [Smith and Zorn] expand the substantive terrain of QI’s reach by illuminating a body of political theory that to date has been elaborated in strictly classical language and formalisms but has complex features that seem to merit generalizations of the prob</p><p>6 0.85024452 <a title="913-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-21-A_possible_resolution_of_the_albedo_mystery%21.html">622 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-21-A possible resolution of the albedo mystery!</a></p>

I haven’t read the article in the question but the claim seems plausible to me.

<p>Introduction: A colleague emailed me with a question about the methods used by  Groseclose and Milyo  in their study of media bias.
 
Before getting to the question, I just wanted to comment that Groseclose has had really bad timing with this project.
 
First off, his article came out in 2005 when everybody was hating Bush.  Even the Republicans who reelected him weren’t thrilled with the guy.  Then his book came out in 2011.  If his book had come out a year ago, that would’ve been perfect:  the 2010 elections coming up, lots of anger at the Democrats and Obama, no peer-reviewed criticisms of his work, etc.  Instead he waited until 2011, and then look what he got:
 
- Republicans feel they have a chance at winning in 2012 so they’re more interested in fighting and less interested in complaining.
 
- John Gasper  shoots down  Groseclose/Milyo in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science.  That’s gotta hurt.  (Until this point, Groseclose could respond to attacks by saying he was waiting until a crit</p><p>5 0.20451497 <a title="828-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.14361562 <a title="828-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>

I’ve often thought there is an asymmetry in media bias, with Democratic reporters–a survey a few years ago found that twice as many journalists identify as Democrats than as Republicans–biasing their reporting by choosing which topics to focus on, and Republican news organization</p><p>4 0.78107852 <a title="828-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>5 0.76242304 <a title="828-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-07-A_False_Consensus_about_Public_Opinion_on_Torture.html">130 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-07-A False Consensus about Public Opinion on Torture</a></p>

Gronke et al. write (as excerpted by Sides):
  
Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.

<p>Introduction: Respected political scientist Tim Groseclose just came out with a book, “Left Turn:  How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.”  I was familiar with Groseclose’s article (with Jeffrey Milyo) on media bias that came out several years ago–it was an interesting study but I was not convinced by its central claim that they were measuring an absolute level of bias–and then recently heard about this new book in the context of some  intemperate  things Groseclose said in a interview on the conservative Fox TV network.
 
Groseclose’s big conclusion is that in the absence of media bias, the average American voter would be positioned at around 25 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is a right-wing Republican and 100 is a left-wing Democrat.  (Seeing as the number line is conventionally drawn from left to right, I think it would make more sense for 0 to represent the left and 100 to be on the right, but I guess it’s too late for him to change now.)  Groseclose places the average voter now at around</p><p>2 0.97444057 <a title="828-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-21-Confusion_about_%E2%80%9Crigging_the_numbers%2C%E2%80%9D_the_support_of_ideological_opposites%2C_who%E2%80%99s_a_501%28c%29%283%29%2C_and_the_asymmetry_of_media_bias.html">812 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-21-Confusion about “rigging the numbers,” the support of ideological opposites, who’s a 501(c)(3), and the asymmetry of media bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of my left-wing colleagues pointed me to  this  Fox TV interview in which UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose expresses displeasure with having his research criticized by liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America.
 
My colleague thought it was irresponsible and unprofessional for Groseclose to get all indignant about the criticism.  But I understood.  I remember how after the state Attorney General’s office released the study Jeff Fagan and I did on police stops ( see here  for the research-paper version), we were viciously attacked.  Some creep from the NYC Law Department sent a nasty letter full of accusations that were . . . I’d say “bullshit” but I don’t want to say that because “bullshit” contains the word “shit” and I don’t want to use profanity on this blog . . . anyway, this lawyer creep sent us an aggressive letter with bogus claims about our research competence.

I just read your article  The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis . I agree on the importance of what you flagged as “comparable incoherence in all other statistical philosophies”. The problem arises when a string of unexpected observations persuades that one’s original structural hypothesis (which might be viewed as a parameter describing the type of statistical relationship) was false. 


However, I would phrase this more positively. Your Bayesian prior actually cedes alternative structural hypotheses, albeit with tiny epsilon weights. Otherwise you would never change your mind. However, these epsilons are so difficult to measure, and small differences can have such a significant impact on speed of adjustment (as in the example in Chapter 7 of Pandora’s Risk), that effectively we all look incoherent. This is a prime example of rational turbulence. 


Rational turbulence can arise even without a structural break.

<p>Introduction: A common aphorism among artificial intelligence practitioners is that A.I. is whatever machines can’t currently do.  
 
Adam Gopnik, writing for the  New Yorker , has a review called  Get Smart  in the most recent issue (4 April 2011).  Ostensibly, the piece is a review of new books, one by Joshua Foer,  Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything , and one by Stephen Baker  Final Jeopardy: Man vs. Machine and the Quest to Know Everything  (which would explain Baker’s spate of  Jeopardy!-related blog posts ).  But like many such pieces in highbrow magazines, the book reviews are just a cover for staking out a philosophical position.  Gopnik does a typically  New Yorker  job in explaining the title of this blog post.
  

 
Gopnik describes his mother as “a logician, linguist, and early Fortran speaker” and goes on to add that she worked on an early machine translation project in Canada.  I’m guessing she’s the Myrna Gopnik behind  this 1968 COLING paper  (LE</p><p>5 0.95934838 <a title="828-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_think_we_get_much_out_of_framing_politics_as_the_Tragic_Vision_vs._the_Utopian_Vision.html">1892 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-10-I don’t think we get much out of framing politics as the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision</a></p>

Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>6 0.95498323 <a title="828-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-13-At_last%2C_treated_with_the_disrespect_that_I_deserve.html">1007 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-13-At last, treated with the disrespect that I deserve</a></p>

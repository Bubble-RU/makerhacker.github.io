<p>Introduction: Here .  (Background  here .)
 
P.S.  Just a thought:  is it possible that one reason for the effectiveness of relief pitchers is that, by the end of the game, the starting players (that is, the hitters who have been playing all game) are getting tired?

<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:
  
Palin’s magic formula for success has been simply to ignore partisan crap and get</p><p>4 0.072958261 <a title="802-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-05-A_statistician_rereads_Bill_James.html">697 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-05-A statistician rereads Bill James</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.  Then I sent him some reflections on the great Bill James and  he published it !  If anybody out there knows Bill James, please send this on to him:  I have some questions at the end that I’m curious about.
 
Here’s how it begins:
  
 
I read my first Bill James book in 1984, took my first statistics class in 1985, and began graduate study in statistics the next year. Besides giving me the opportunity to study with the best applied statistician of the late 20th century (Don Rubin) and the best theoretical statistician of the early 21st (Xiao-Li Meng), going to graduate school at Harvard in 1986 gave me the opportunity to sit in a basement room one evening that</p><p>5 0.072094545 <a title="802-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-19-Google%E2%80%99s_word_count_statistics_viewer.html">476 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-19-Google’s word count statistics viewer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A University of Delaware press release  reports :
  
This month, the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports will feature the article “An Estimate of How Hitting, Pitching, Fielding, and Base-stealing Impact Team Winning Percentages in Baseball.”  In it, University of Delaware Prof. Charles Pavitt of the Department of Communication defines the perfect “formula” for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams to use to build the ultimate winning team.


Pavitt found hitting accounts for more than 45 percent of teams’ winning records, fielding for 25 percent and pitching for 25 percent. And that the impact of stolen bases is greatly overestimated.


He crunched hitting, pitching, fielding and base-stealing records for every MLB team over a 48-year period from 1951-1998 with a method no other researcher has used in this area. In statistical parlance, he used a conceptual decomposition of offense and defense into its component parts and then analyzed recombinations of the parts in intuitively mea</p><p>3 0.76110661 <a title="802-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-03-Getting_a_job_in_pro_sports%E2%80%A6_as_a_statistician.html">445 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-03-Getting a job in pro sports… as a statistician</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Posted  at MediaBistro:
  

The  Harvard Sports Analysis Collective  are the group that tackles problems such as “ Who wrote this column: Bill Simmons, Rick Reilly, or Kevin Whitlock? ” and “ Should a football team give up free touchdowns? ”


It’s all fun and games, until  the students  land jobs with major teams.


According to the  Harvard Crimson , sophomore   John Ezekowitz   and junior   Jason Rosenfeld   scored gigs with the Phoenix Suns and the Shanghai Sharks, respectively, in part based on their work for HSAC.


It’s perhaps not a huge surprise that the Sharks would be interested in taking advantage of every available statistic. They are owned by Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets. The Rockets, in turn, employ general manager   Daryl Morey   who Simmons  nicknamed  “Dork Elvis” for his ahead of the curve analysis. (See   Michael Lewis  ‘  The No Stats All-Star  for an example.) But still, it’s very cool to see the pair get an opportunity to change the game.</p><p>4 0.75208724 <a title="802-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-12-Probability_of_successive_wins_in_baseball.html">29 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-12-Probability of successive wins in baseball</a></p>

When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days, what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game?

Dan writes:
  
We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting. The answers came in between 65% and 70%.






The true answer [based on Dan's analysis of a database of baseball games]: 51.3%, a little better than a coin toss.
  
I have to say, I’m surprised his colleagues gave such extreme guesses.  I was guessing something like 50%, myself, based on the following very crude reasoning:
 
Suppose two unequal teams are playing, and the chance of team A beating team B is 55%.  (This seems like a reasonable average of all matchups, which will include some more extreme disparities but also many more equal contests.)  Then the chance of the same team</p><p>5 0.73753273 <a title="802-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-03-Gladwell_vs_Pinker.html">253 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-03-Gladwell vs Pinker</a></p>

Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”


Well, here’s what you can find on Google.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)


This does not appear to work since it wi</p><p>4 0.75698143 <a title="802-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-28-Wiley_Wegman_chutzpah_update%3A__Now_you_too_can_buy_a_selection_of_garbled_Wikipedia_articles%2C_for_a_mere_%241400-%242800_per_year%21.html">930 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-28-Wiley Wegman chutzpah update:  Now you too can buy a selection of garbled Wikipedia articles, for a mere $1400-$2800 per year!</a></p>

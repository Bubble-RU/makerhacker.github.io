<p>Introduction: I was asked by Sophie Roell, an editor at  The Browser ,  where every day they ask an expert in a field to recommend the top five books, not by them, in their subject.  I was asked to recommend five books on how Americans vote.
 
The trouble is that I’m really pretty unfamiliar with the academic literature of political science, but it seemed sort of inappropriate for a political scientist such as myself to recommend non-scholarly books that I like (for example, “Style vs. Substance” by George V. Higgins, “Lies My Teacher Told Me,” by James Loewen, “The Rascal King” by Jack Beatty, “Republican Party Reptile” by P. J. O’Rourke, and, of course, “All the King’s Men,” by Robert Penn Warren).  I mean, what’s the point of that?  Nobody needs me to recommend books like that.
 
Instead, I moved sideways and asked if I could discuss five books on statistics instead.  Roell said that would be fine, so I sent her a quick description, which appears below.

<p>Introduction: This  post by Jordan Ellenberg (“Stoner represents a certain strain in the mid-century American novel that I really like, and which I don’t think exists in contemporary fiction.  Anguish, verbal restraint, weirdness”) reminds me that what I really like is mid-to-late-twentieth-century  literary criticism .  I read a great book from the 50s, I think it was, by Anthony West (son of Rebecca West and H. G. Wells), who reviewed books for the New Yorker.  It was great, and it made me wish that other collections of his reviews had been published (they hadn’t). I’d also love to read collections of  Alfred Kazin ‘s reviews (there are some collections, but he published many many others that have never been reprinted) and others of that vintage.  I’m pretty sure these hypothetical books wouldn’t sell many copies, though. (I feel lucky, though, that at one point a publisher released a pretty fat collection of  Anthony Burgess ‘s book reviews.) It’s actually scary to think that many many more peopl</p><p>5 0.11274758 <a title="620-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-29-Why_%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1190 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-29-Why “Why”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In old books (and occasionally new books), you see the word “Why” used to indicate a pause or emphasis in dialogue.
 
For example, from 1952:
  
“Why, how perfectly simple!” she said to herself.  “The way to save Wilbur’s life is to play a trick on Zuckerman.  “If I can fool a bug,” thought Charlotte, “I can surely fool a man.  People are not as smart as bugs.”
  
That line about people and bugs was cute, but what really jumped out at me was the “Why.”  I don’t think I’ve ever ever heard anyone use “Why” in that way in conversation, but I see it all the time in books, and every time it’s jarring.
 
What’s the deal?  Is it that people used to talk that way?  Or is a Wasp thing, some regional speech pattern that was captured in books because it was considered standard conversational speech?  I suppose one way to learn more would be to watch a bunch of old movies.  I could sort of imagine Jimmy Stewart beginning his sentences with “Why” all the time.
 
Does anyone know more?

Pretty good, but really the pie chart should be three-dimensional, shown at an angle, and with one or two of the slices popping out.
 
P.S.  They seemed to have placed a link for the Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.

<p>Introduction: Surfing the  blogroll , I found myself on Helen DeWitt’s  page  and noticed the link to the Joshua Clover, alias Jane Dark.  I hadn’t checked out Clover for awhile (see my reactions  here  and  here ), so I decided to head on over.
 
Here’s what it looked like:
 
   
 
“The case against the Federal minimum wage,” huh?  That surprised me, as I had the vague impression that Clover was on the far left of the American political spectrum.  But I guess he could have some sort of wonky thing going on, or maybe there’s some unexpected twist?  It seemed a bit off of Clover’s usual cultural-criticism beat, so I clicked through to take a look . . . and it was just a boring set of paragraphs on the minimum wage.
 
Hmmmm.  I went back to the homepage, looked around more carefully, and realized that the blog is fake, the online equivalent of those fake book spines that are used to simulate rows of books on a bookshelf.
 
I don’t know what happened.  My guess is that Clover got tired of blogging and</p><p>6 0.70854717 <a title="620-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-05-Wacky_interview_questions%3A__An_exploration_into_the_nature_of_evidence_on_the_internet.html">505 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-05-Wacky interview questions:  An exploration into the nature of evidence on the internet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>2 0.95193362 <a title="620-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-Math_Talks_%3A%3A_Action_Movies.html">1617 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-Math Talks :: Action Movies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Goodman  gave the  departmental seminar  yesterday (10 Dec 2012) and I was amused by an extended analogy he made.  After his (very clear) intro, he said that math talks were like action movies.  The overall theorem and its applications provide the plot, and the proofs provide the action scenes.</p><p>3 0.93553603 <a title="620-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-13-Against_the_myth_of_the_heroic_visualization.html">1896 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-13-Against the myth of the heroic visualization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.

<p>Introduction: I saw an analysis recently that I didn’t like.  I won’t go into the details, but basically it was a dose-response inference, where a continuous exposure was binned into three broad categories (terciles of the data) and the probability of an adverse event was computed for each tercile.  The effect and the sample size was large enough that the terciles were statistically-significantly different from each other in probability of adverse event, with the probabilities increasing from low to mid to high exposure, as one would predict.
 
I didn’t like this analysis because it is equivalent to fitting a step function.  There is a tendency for people to interpret the (arbitrary) tercile boundaries as being meaningful thresholds even though the underlying dose-response relation has to be continuous.  I’d prefer to start with a linear model and then add nonlinearity from there with a spline or whatever.
 
At this point I stepped back and thought:  Hey, the divide-into-three analysis does not lite</p><p>5 0.90619034 <a title="620-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-08-More_on_essentialism.html">1107 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-08-More on essentialism</a></p>

</p><p>3 Now, one might note that many of the poor residents of New Haven are likely to be students. [sent-5, score-0.155]
</p><p>4 But these students still use municipal services and thus require the local tax base to support them (in addition to the long term residents). [sent-7, score-0.316]
</p><p>5 They do not (after they graduate and make additional income) send money back to New Haven so, in a sense, New Haven is actually subsiding the urban communities that Yale graduates move to. [sent-8, score-0.312]
</p><p>6 So, it is actually possible that a large university in a small community could be a drag on the economy due to the lower per capita tax base. [sent-9, score-0.542]
</p><p>7 Plus, you have a large segment of the population with only a short term interest in the community which may make long term planning more difficult. [sent-10, score-0.489]

</p><p>13 More general, I think a key step in statistics is making the connection between individual cases and overall patterns. [sent-16, score-0.156]

<p>Introduction: Last year my commenters and I  discussed  Ed Glaeser’s claim that the way to create a great city is to “create a great university and wait 200 years.”
 
I passed this on to urbanist Richard Florida and received the following response: 
  
  
This is a tough one with lots of causality issues.  Generally speaking universities make places stronger. But this is mainly the case for smaller, college towws. Boulder, Ann Arbor and so on, which also have very high human capital levels and high levels of creative, knowledge and professional workers. 


For big cities the issue is mixed. Take Pittsburgh with CMU and Pitt or Baltimore with Hopkins, or St Louis. The list goes on and on.


Kevin Stolarick and I framed this very crudely as a transmitter reciever issue. The university in a city like this can generate a lot of signal, in terms of innovation or even human capital and the city may not receive it or push it away. A long ago paper by Mike Fogarty showed how innovations in Pittsburgh and Cl</p><p>3 0.13263699 <a title="624-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Steve_Jobs%E2%80%99s_cancer_and_science-based_medicine.html">953 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Steve Jobs’s cancer and science-based medicine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  from David Gorski (which I found via  this  link from Joseph Delaney).
 
I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.  It’s only n=1 and adds almost nothing to the literature on the effectiveness of various treatments, but a story like this can help focus one’s thoughts on the decision problems.</p><p>4 0.1236013 <a title="624-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-01-Doing_Data_Science%3A__What%E2%80%99s_it_all_about%3F.html">2084 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-01-Doing Data Science:  What’s it all about?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil just came out with a  wonderfully readable book  on doing data science, based on  a course Rachel taught last year  at Columbia.  Rachel is a former Ph.D. student of mine and so I’m inclined to have a positive view of her work; on the other hand, I did actually look at the book and I did find it readable!
 
 What do I claim is the least important part of data science? 
 
Here’s what Schutt and O’Neil say regarding the title:  “Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself.”  I agree.  There’s so much that goes on with data that is about computing, not statistics.  I do think it would be fair to consider statistics (which includes sampling, experimental design, and data collection as well as data analysis (which itself includes model building, visualization, and model checking as well as inference)) as a subset of data science.
 
The question then arises:  why do descriptions of data science focus so</p><p>5 0.11521875 <a title="624-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-02-Back_when_50_miles_was_a_long_way.html">1649 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-02-Back when 50 miles was a long way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Michael Graham Richard has  posted some great maps  from the 1932 Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States; the maps show how long it took to get to various places in the U.S. from New York City in 1800, 1830, 1857, and 1930. (I wonder if the atlas has one from around 1900 as well, that didn’t make it into the article? I’d like to see it, too, if it exists.)  Worth a look.

<p>Introduction: See here  (if you care).
 
P.S.  Kaus writes that, when he was on William Bennett’s radio show, “Bennett immediately zeroed in on a key political mystery: Are African-American voters on board with the Democrats’ recent amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants program?”  I wonder if Kaus asked Bennett about  this quote :
  
But I [Bennett] do know that it’s true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could — if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down. 
  
As Brendan Nyhan notes, Bennett wasn’t actually  suggesting  that black babies be aborted–in fact, Bennett said, “That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down.”  Bennett definitely sounds like the go-to guy for a savvy discussion of the black vote!
  

 
P.P.S.  Just to clarify for those who might think that Bennett was simply calling-it-like-it-is, albeit in a politically incorrect style . . .

<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .
  
OK, fine, so individual creatives aren’t doing so well?  But what about the larger urban economies?  P</p><p>4 0.68866491 <a title="624-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-13-Economists_._._..html">1378 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-13-Economists . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Catherine Rampell  writes :
  
On Monday the Nobel Foundation, which bestows the world’s most prestigious academic, literary and humanitarian prizes, said it was reducing the cash awarded with Nobel Prizes by about 20 percent. . . .


Peter A. Diamond, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also received the Nobel in economic science in 2010, observed that over the long run, cutting the cash award could dilute the prize’s prestige.


But he added that Monday’s news overstates the financial blow to future laureates. “One of the things that comes with the prize, besides the prestige and the money,” he said, “is the opportunities to make more money.”
  
I wouldn’t think these guys need the money, but I suppose it’s part of their professional code that they have to say that?  (Recall our earlier  discussion  of the economist who said he’d stop working once his marginal tax rate reached the anticipated value of 93%.)</p><p>5 0.68513489 <a title="624-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-Who_gets_wedding_announcements_in_the_Times%3F.html">370 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-Who gets wedding announcements in the Times?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was flipping through the paper yesterday and noticed something which I think is a bit of innumeracy–although I don’t have all the facts at my disposal so I can’t be sure.  It came in an item by Robert Woletz, society editor of the New York Times, in response to the following letter from Max Sarinsky ( click here  and scroll down):
  
 
The heavy majority of couples typically featured in the Sunday wedding announcements either attended elite universities, hold corporate management positions or have parents with corporate management positions. It’s nice to learn about the nuptials of the privileged, but Times readers would benefit from learning about a more representative sampling of weddings in our diverse city.


I [Sarinksy] am curious as to how editors select which announcements to publish, and why editors don’t make a sustained effort to include different types of couples.

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

We all know it’s ridiculous to be able to go on an fMRI fishing trip & resort to post hoc story-telling to explain the “significant” correlations one (inevitably) observes (good fMRI studies *don’t* do this; only bad ones do– to the injury of the reputation of all the  scholars doing good studies of this kind). But now one doesn’t even need correlations that support the post-hoc inferences one is drawing.
  
This one’s good.  Kahan continues:

<p>Introduction: Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute reports:
  
Goldman Sachs’ latest forecast (and they’ve been pretty accurate so far) is that unemployment will rise to 9.9% by early 2011 and trend down to 9.7% for the last quarter of 2011. Obviously, this is a simply awful scenario but it seems one that is being accepted. That is, we seem to be in the process of accepting the unacceptable. Note that this scenario probably assumes the passage of the limited efforts now being considered in Congress.
  
One might be surprised that Obama and congressional Democrats are not doing more to try to bring unemployment down.  On the other hand, just to speak in generalities (not knowing any of the people involved), I would think that Obama would be much much more worried about the economy doing well in 2010 and then crashing in 2012.  A crappy economy through 2011 and then improvement in 2012–that would be his ideal, no?  Not that he would have the ability to time this sort of thing.

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

<p>Introduction: A  New York Times article  reports the opening of a half-mile section of bike path, recently built along the west side of Manhattan at a cost of $16M, or roughly $30 million per mile.  That’s about $5700 per linear foot.  Kinda sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?   
 
Well, $30 million per mile for about one car-lane mile is a lot, but it’s not out of line compared to other urban highway construction costs.  The Doyle Drive project in San Francisco — a freeway to replace the current old and deteriorating freeway approach to the Golden Gate Bridge — is currently under way at $1 billion for 1.6 miles…but hey, it will have six lanes each way, so that isn’t so bad, at $50 million per lane-mile.  And there are other components to the project, too, not just building the highway (there will also be bike paths, landscaping, on- and off-ramps, and so on).  All in all it seems roughly in line with the New York bike lane project.
 
Speaking of the Doyle Drive project, one expense was the cost of movin</p><p>6 0.94525307 <a title="624-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-02-At_least_he_didn%E2%80%99t_prove_a_false_theorem.html">741 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-02-At least he didn’t prove a false theorem</a></p>

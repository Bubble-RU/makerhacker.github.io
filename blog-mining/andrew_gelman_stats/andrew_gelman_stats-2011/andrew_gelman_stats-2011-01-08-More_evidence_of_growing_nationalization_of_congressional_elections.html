<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  wrote  that Mickey Kaus was right to point out that it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.” As Kaus points out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.  The slogan is particularly silly for Tip O’Neill himself.  Sure, O’Neill had to have a firm grip on local politics to get his safe seat in the first place, but after that it was smooth sailing.
 
Jonathan Bernstein  disagrees , writing:
  
 
Yes, but: don’t most Members of the House have ironclad partisan districts?  And isn’t the most important single thing they can do to protect themselves involve having pull in state politics to avoid being gerrymandered?  That is “all politics is local,” no? 


There’s also a fair amount they can do to stay on the good side of their local party, thus avoiding a primary fight.  And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>3 0.36407468 <a title="508-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-19-All_politics_are_local_%E2%80%94_not.html">475 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-19-All politics are local — not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>4 0.12764569 <a title="508-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.11538547 <a title="508-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-07-Minor-league_Stats_Predict_Major-league_Performance%2C_Sarah_Palin%2C_and_Some_Differences_Between_Baseball_and_Politics.html">652 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-07-Minor-league Stats Predict Major-league Performance, Sarah Palin, and Some Differences Between Baseball and Politics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:
  
Palin’s magic formula for success has been simply to ignore partisan crap and get</p><p>6 0.11504365 <a title="508-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-12-Comparison_of_forecasts_for_the_2010_congressional_elections.html">270 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-12-Comparison of forecasts for the 2010 congressional elections</a></p>

And, even in an era of nationalized elections, there’s still plenty a Member of Congress can do to to influence elections on the margins, a</p><p>3 0.87216204 <a title="508-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-19-All_politics_are_local_%E2%80%94_not.html">475 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-19-All politics are local — not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>4 0.79054588 <a title="508-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-Politics_is_not_a_random_walk%3A__Momentum_and_mean_reversion_in_polling.html">364 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-Politics is not a random walk:  Momentum and mean reversion in polling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>5 0.73104733 <a title="508-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-15-Statistical_analysis_and_visualization_of_the_drug_war_in_Mexico.html">87 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-15-Statistical analysis and visualization of the drug war in Mexico</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian points me to this  interesting (but sad) analysis  by Diego Valle with an impressive series of graphs.  There are a few things I’d change (notably the R default settings which result in ridiculously over-indexed y-axes, as well as axes for homicide rates which should (but do not) go town to zero (and sometimes, bizarrely, go negative), and a lack of coherent ordering of the 32 states (including D.F.),
 
I’m no expert on Mexico (despite having coauthored a paper on Mexican politics) so I’ll leave it to others to evaluate the substantive claims in Valle’s blog.  Just looking at what he’s done, though, it seems impressive to me.

<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95698267 <a title="508-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-08-More_evidence_of_growing_nationalization_of_congressional_elections.html">508 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-08-More evidence of growing nationalization of congressional elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day  I posted some evidence  that, however things used to be, congressional elections are increasingly nationalized, and it’s time to retire Tip O’Neill’s slogan, “all politics is local.”  (The discussion started with a  remark  by O.G. blogger Mickey Kaus; I also explain why I disagree with Jonathan Bernstein’s  disagreement  with me.)
 
Alan Abramowitz writes in with an analysis of National Election Study from a recent paper of his:

<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about that Yale professor who wrote that book,  remember , she screamed at her daughters all the time and didn’t let them go the bathroom while they were practicing piano (violin?), Asian parenting-style etc etc.
 
I was just wondering . . . what if she’d had sons rather than daughters?  What are the rules?  Would bringing up boys be the job of mellow white dad rather than intense Asian mom?  If mom were still in charge, would the boys be doing piano, or something else like hockey?  Tiger Mom seems to be into traditional values so I’m assuming she’d want her kids doing something sex-stereotyped?  But sports would be tough, her (hypothetical) boys would have to compete with big strong athletes and would be less likely to be winners so then she couldn’t brag about her amazing parenting skills.
 
I really don’t know the answer to this one.  Maybe some of our readers who are Yale law professors can enlighten us?</p><p>4 0.95530939 <a title="508-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-10-I_guess_they_noticed_that_if_you_take_the_first_word_on_every_seventeenth_page%2C_it_spells_out_%E2%80%9CDeath_to_the_Shah%E2%80%9D.html">510 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-10-I guess they noticed that if you take the first word on every seventeenth page, it spells out “Death to the Shah”</a></p>

I write with regards to the project to publish a China Edition of your book “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” (ISBN-13: 9780521686891) for the mainland Chinese market. I regret to inform you that we have been notified by our partner in China, Posts & Telecommunications Press (PTP), that due to various politically sensitive materials in the text, the China Edition has not met with the approval of the publishing authorities in China, and as such PTP will not be able to proceed with the publication of this edition. We will therefore have to cancel plans for the China Edition of your book. Please accept my apologies for this unforeseen development. If you have any queries regarding this, do feel free to let me know.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.

<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  discussed  the evaluation of somewhat-plausible claims that are somewhat supported by theory and somewhat supported by statistical evidence.  One point I raised was that an implausibly large estimate of effect size can be cause for concern:
  
Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the name-choice article by Pelham et al.) argued that the implied effects were too large to be believed (just as I was arguing above regarding the July 4th study), which makes more plausible his claims that the results arise from methodological artifacts.


That calculation is straight Bayes: the distribution of systematic errors has much longer tails than the distribution of random errors, so the larger the estimated effect, the more likely it is to be a mistake. This little theoretical result is a bit annoying, because it is the larger effects that are the most interesting!”

<p>Introduction: Shravan writes:
  
I have a problem very similar to the one presented chapter 6 of BDA, the speed of light example. You use the distribution of the minimum scores from the posterior predictive distribution, show that it’s not realistic given the data, and suggest that an asymmetric contaminated normal distribution or a symmetric long-tailed distribution would be better.


How does one use such a distribution?
  
My reply:
 
You can actually use a symmetric long-tailed distribution such as t with low degrees of freedom.  One striking feature of symmetric long-tailed distributions is that a small random sample from such a distribution can have outliers on one side or the other and look asymmetric.
 
Just to see this, try the following in R: 
  
par (mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1)) 
for (i in 1:9) hist (rt (100, 2), xlab="", ylab="", main="") 
 
 
You’ll see some skewed distributions.

<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

<p>Introduction: In my discussion of dentists-named-Dennis study, I referred to my back-of-the-envelope  calculation  that the effect (if it indeed exists) corresponds to an approximate 1% aggregate chance that you’ll pick a profession based on your first name.  Even if there are nearly twice as many dentist Dennises as would be expected from chance alone, the base rate is so low that a shift of 1% of all Dennises would be enough to do this.  My point was that (a) even a small effect could show up when looking at low-frequency events such as the choice to pick a particular career or live in a particular city, and (b) any small effects will inherently be difficult to detect in any direct way.

I learned this the hard way after receiving this note from Bin Liu, who wrote:
  
Today I saw  a paper  [by Ziheng Yang and Carlos Rodríguez] titled “Searching for efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo proposal kernels.”  The authors cited your work: “Gelman A, Roberts GO, Gilks WR (1996) Bayesian Statistics 5, eds Bernardo JM, et al.

In the last sentence of pp.19310, the authors write that “… virtually no study has examined alternative kernels; this appears to be due to the influence of ref. 6, which claimed that different kernels had nearly identical performance. This conclusion is incorrect.”

<p>Introduction: Around these parts we see a continuing flow of unusual claims supported by some statistical evidence.  The claims are varyingly plausible a priori.  Some examples (I won’t bother to supply the links; regular readers will remember these examples and newcomers can find them by searching):
 
- Obesity is contagious 
- People’s names affect where they live, what jobs they take, etc. 
- Beautiful people are more likely to have girl babies 
- More attractive instructors have higher teaching evaluations 
- In a basketball game, it’s better to be behind by a point at halftime than to be ahead by a point 
- Praying for someone without their knowledge improves their recovery from heart attacks 
- A variety of claims about ESP
 
How should we think about these claims?  The usual approach is to evaluate the statistical evidence–in particular, to look for reasons that the claimed results are not really statistically significant.  If nobody can shoot down a claim, it survives.

<p>Introduction: She was  assigned to teach a class in “evidence-based medicine”!  ( link  from my usual news source).
 
I wonder what was in the syllabus?  If anyone has a copy, feel free to send to me and I will post it here.
 
My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.
  
Talk about obedience to authority!  They’re studying in a program that offers nonexistent courses, but then they follow the department’s gag order.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87593269 <a title="808-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-18-The_estimated_effect_size_is_implausibly_large.__Under_what_models_is_this_a_piece_of_evidence_that_the_true_effect_is_small%3F.html">808 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-18-The estimated effect size is implausibly large.  Under what models is this a piece of evidence that the true effect is small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this? I think i</p><p>4 0.86310703 <a title="808-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-Note_to_the_quals.html">124 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-Note to the quals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>6 0.78409898 <a title="808-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-23-In_which_I_disagree_with_John_Maynard_Keynes.html">1775 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-23-In which I disagree with John Maynard Keynes</a></p>

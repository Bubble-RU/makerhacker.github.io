<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

<p>Introduction: I liked it; the reviews were well-deserved.  It indeed is a cross between The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.
 
What struck me most, though, was the contrast with Indecision, the novel by Harbach’s associate, Benjamin Kunkel.  As I noted  a few years ago , Indecision was notable in that all the characters had agency. That is, each character had his or her own ideas and seemed to act on his or her own ideas, rather than merely carrying the plot along or providing scenery.  In contrast, the most gripping drama in The Art of Fielding seem to be characters’ struggling with their plot-determined roles (hence the connection with Coover’s God-soaked baseball classic).  Also notable to me was that the college-aged characters not being particularly obsessed with sex—I guess this is that easy-going hook-up culture I keep reading about—while at the same time, just about all the characters seem to be involved in serious drug addiction.

<p>Introduction: I was curious  so I ordered a used copy.  It was pretty good.  It fit in my pocket and I read it on the plane.  It was written in a bland, spare manner, not worth reading for any direct insights it would give into human nature, but the plot moved along.  And the  background material  was interesting in the window it gave into the society of the 1950s.  It was fun to read a book of pulp fiction that didnâ&euro;&trade;t have any dead bodies in it.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links approvingly  to  this review  by B. R. Myers of a book that I haven’t read.  Unlike Cowen, I haven’t seen the book in question–so far, I’ve only read the excerpt that appeared in the New Yorker–but I can say that I found Myers’s review very annoying.  Myers writes:
  
 
The same narrator who gives us “sucked” and “very into” also deploys compound adjectives, bursts of journalese, and long if syntactically crude sentences. An idiosyncratic mix? Far from it. We find the same insecure style on The Daily Show and in the blogosphere; we overhear it on the subway. It is the style of all who think highly enough of their own brains to worry about being thought “elitist,” not one of the gang. . . .


But if Freedom is middlebrow, it is so in the sacrosanct Don DeLillo tradition, which our critical establishment considers central to literature today. . . .

<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:
  
Check out the figure below from The Grammar of Graphics. Dan Rope invented this graphic and programmed it in Java in the late 1990′s. We shopped this graph around to Orbitz and Expedia but they weren’t interested. So I</p><p>5 0.81009555 <a title="655-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk_worked.html">2238 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk worked</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past I’ve categorized Hipmunk as  a really cool flight-finder that doesn’t actually work , as  worse than Expedia , and as  graphics without content .
 
So, I thought it would be only fair to tell you that I bought a flight the other day using Hipmunk and it gave me the same flight as Expedia but at a lower cost (by linking to something called CheapOair, which I hope is legit).  So score one for Hipmunk.</p><p>6 0.80277598 <a title="655-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-29-Could_someone_please_set_this_as_the_new_R_default_in_base_graphics%3F.html">379 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-29-Could someone please set this as the new R default in base graphics?</a></p>

While I am absolutely sympathetic to the Bayesian agenda I am often troubled by the requirement of having priors. We must have priors on the parameter of an infinite number of model we have never seen before and I find this troubling. There is a similarly troubling problem in economics of utility theory. Utility is on consumables. To be complete a consumer must assign utility to all sorts of things they never would have encountered. More recent versions of utility theory instead make consumption goods a portfolio of attributes. Cadillacs are x many units of luxury y of transport etc etc. And we can automatically have personal utilities to all these attributes.  


I don’t ever see parameters. Some model have few and some have hundreds. Instead, I see data. So I don’t know how to have an opinion on parameters themselves. Rather I think it far more natural to have opinions on the behavior of models. The prior predictive density is a good and sensible notion.

<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

<p>Introduction: Mike McLaughlin writes:
  
Consider the Seeds example in vol. 1 of the BUGS examples.  There, a binomial likelihood has a p parameter constructed, via logit, from two covariates.  What I am wondering is: Would it be legitimate, in a binomial + logit problem like this, to allow binomial p[i] to be a function of the corresponding n[i] or would that amount to using the data in the prior?  In other words, in the context of the Seeds example, is r[] the only data or is n[] data as well and therefore not permissible in a prior formulation?


I [McLaughlin] currently have a model with a common beta prior for all p[i] but would like to mitigate this commonality (a kind of James-Stein effect) when there are lots of observations for some i.  But this seems to feed the data back into the prior.  Does it really?


It also occurs to me [McLaughlin] that, perhaps, a binomial likelihood is not the one to use here (not flexible enough).

I’m facing a problem where parameter space is bounded, e.g. all parameters have to be positive. If in MCMC as proposal distribution I use normal distribution, then at some iterations I get negative proposals. So my question is: should I use recalculation of acceptance probability every time I reject the proposal (something like in delayed rejection method), or I have to use another proposal (like lognormal, truncated normal, etc.)?
  
The simplest solution is to just calculate p(theta)=0 for theta outside the legal region, thus reject those jumps.  This will work fine (just remember that when you reject, you have to stay at the last value for one more iteration), but if you’re doing these rejections all the time, you might want to reparameterize your space, for example using logs for positive parameters, logits for constrained parameters, and softmax for parameters that are constrained to sum to 1.</p><p>4 0.74161446 <a title="961-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-09-How_to_model_distributions_that_have_outliers_in_one_direction.html">2128 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-09-How to model distributions that have outliers in one direction</a></p>

I have a problem very similar to the one presented chapter 6 of BDA, the speed of light example. You use the distribution of the minimum scores from the posterior predictive distribution, show that it’s not realistic given the data, and suggest that an asymmetric contaminated normal distribution or a symmetric long-tailed distribution would be better.


How does one use such a distribution?
  
My reply:
 
You can actually use a symmetric long-tailed distribution such as t with low degrees of freedom.  One striking feature of symmetric long-tailed distributions is that a small random sample from such a distribution can have outliers on one side or the other and look asymmetric.
 
Just to see this, try the following in R: 
  
par (mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1)) 
for (i in 1:9) hist (rt (100, 2), xlab="", ylab="", main="")

<p>Introduction: I had the following email exchange with a reader of Bayesian Data Analysis.
  

 
 My correspondent wrote:   Exercise 1(b) involves evaluating the normal pdf at a single point. But p(Y=y|mu,sigma) = 0 (and is not simply N(y|mu,sigma)), since the normal distribution is continuous. So it seems that part (b) of the exercise is inappropriate.
 
The solution does actually evaluate the probability as the value of the pdf at the single point, which is wrong. The probabilities should all be 0, so the answer to (b) is undefined.
 
 I replied:   The pdf is the probability density function, which for a continuous distribution is defined as the derivative of the cumulative density function.  The notation in BDA is rigorous but we do not spell out all the details, so I can see how confusion is possible. 
 
 My correspondent:   I agree that the pdf is the derivative of the cdf. But to compute P(a .lt.

<p>Introduction: Daniel Lakeland  asks , “Where do likelihoods come from?”  He describes a class of problems where you have a deterministic dynamic model that you want to fit to data.  The data won’t fit perfectly so, if you want to do Bayesian inference, you need to introduce an error model.  This looks a little bit different from the usual way that models are presented in statistics textbooks, where the focus is typically on the random error process, not on the deterministic part of the model.  A focus on the error process makes sense in some applications that have inherent randomness or variation (for example, genetics, psychology, and survey sampling) but not so much in the physical sciences, where the deterministic model can be complicated and is typically the essence of the study.  Often in these sorts of studies, the staring point (and sometimes the ending point) is what the physicists call “nonlinear least squares” or what we would call normally-distributed errors.  That’s what we did for our</p><p>2 0.98481834 <a title="961-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-11-One_more_time_on_that_ESP_study%3A__The_problem_of_overestimates_and_the_shrinkage_solution.html">511 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-11-One more time on that ESP study:  The problem of overestimates and the shrinkage solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Benedict Carey  writes  a follow-up article on ESP studies and Bayesian statistics.  ( See here  for my previous thoughts on the topic.)  Everything Carey writes is fine, and he even uses an example I recommended:
  
The statistical approach that has dominated the social sciences for almost a century is called significance testing. The idea is straightforward. A finding from any well-designed study — say, a correlation between a personality trait and the risk of depression — is considered “significant” if its probability of occurring by chance is less than 5 percent.


This arbitrary cutoff makes sense when the effect being studied is a large one — for example, when measuring the so-called Stroop effect. This effect predicts that naming the color of a word is faster and more accurate when the word and color match (“red” in red letters) than when they do not (“red” in blue letters), and is very strong in almost everyone.

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

I was interested by your  paper  “Induction and deduction in Bayesian data analysis” and was wondering if you would entertain a few questions:
  
  
  
 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables). Bayesian inference involves calculating the objective degree of plausibility of a hypothesis (typically the truth value of the hypothesis is a function of the variables mentioned above) given such a</p><p>6 0.98220265 <a title="961-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-Write_This_Book.html">1605 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-Write This Book</a></p>

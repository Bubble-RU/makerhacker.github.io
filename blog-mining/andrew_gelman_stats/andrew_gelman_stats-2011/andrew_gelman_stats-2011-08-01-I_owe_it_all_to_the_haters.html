<p>Introduction: I’m postponing today’s scheduled post (“Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models”) to continue the lively discussion from yesterday,  What if I were to stop publishing in journals? . 
   
 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.  The second paper, in particular, took some effort to place; I got some advice from colleagues in sociology as to where</p><p>3 0.23886032 <a title="834-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-06-How_to_think_about_papers_published_in_low-grade_journals%3F.html">1928 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-06-How to think about papers published in low-grade journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.  I commented as follows:

<p>Introduction: I had a submission a couple years ago that was rejected by a journal.  One of the reviewers began with the following snotty aside:
  
In this manuscript Gelman and Shalizi (there’s no anonymity here; this thing has been floating around the web for some time) . . .
  
Actually, we posted it on the same day we submitted it to the journal.  But double-blindness allowed the reviewer to act as if we had done something wrong!  And, even if it  had  been “floating around the web for some time,” that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Perhaps it just meant that the article had previously been rejected by a bad-attitude reviewer!</p><p>5 0.17742477 <a title="834-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  blog post  by Phil Davis on “the emergence of a citation cartel.”  Davis tells the story: 
  
  
Cell Transplantation is a medical journal published by the Cognizant Communication Corporation of Putnam Valley, New York. In recent years, its impact factor has been growing rapidly. In 2006, it was 3.482 [I think he means "3.5"---ed.]. In 2010, it had almost doubled to 6.204.


When you look at which journals cite Cell Transplantation, two journals stand out noticeably: the Medical Science Monitor, and The Scientific World Journal. According to the JCR, neither of these journals cited Cell Transplantation until 2010.


Then, in 2010, a review article was published in the Medical Science Monitor citing 490 articles, 445 of which were to papers published in Cell Transplantation. All 445 citations pointed to papers published in 2008 or 2009 — the citation window from which the journal’s 2010 impact factor was derived. Of the remaining 45 citations, 44 cited the Me</p><p>4 0.88705897 <a title="834-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.88467896 <a title="834-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-Arrow%E2%80%99s_theorem_update.html">883 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-Arrow’s theorem update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this letter  to Bruno Frey from the editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.  ( Background here , also  more here  from Olaf Storbeck.)  The journal editor was upset about Frey’s self-plagiarism, and Frey responded with an apology:
  
It was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable. . . . Please be assured that we take all precautions and measures that this unfortunate event does not happen again, with any journal.
  
What I wonder is:  How “deplorable” does Frey really think this is?  You don’t publish a paper in 5 different places by accident!  Is Frey saying that he knew this was deplorable back then and he did it anyway, based on calculation balancing the gains from multiple publications vs. the potential losses if he got caught?

<p>Introduction: Jeff points us to this  news article  by Asher Mullard:
  
Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims, finds a first-of-a-kind analysis on data irreproducibility.


An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting, wrote venture capitalist Bruce Booth in a recent blog post. A first-of-a-kind analysis of Bayer’s internal efforts to validate ‘new drug target’ claims now not only supports this view but suggests that 50% may be an underestimate; the company’s in-house experimental data do not match literature claims in 65% of target-validation projects, leading to project discontinuation. . . .


Khusru Asadullah, Head of Target Discovery at Bayer, and his colleagues looked back at 67 target-validation projects, covering the majority of Bayer’s work in oncology, women’s health and cardiov</p><p>3 0.95150077 <a title="834-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-99%21.html">1394 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-99!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>5 0.90084821 <a title="834-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-24-Statistical_ethics_violation.html">1081 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-24-Statistical ethics violation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

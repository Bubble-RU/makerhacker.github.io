<p>Introduction: Paul Alper writes:
  
For years I [Alper] have been obsessed by the color of the line which divides oncoming (i.e., opposing) traffic because I was firmly convinced that the color of the center line changed during my lifetime.  Yet, I never could find anyone who had the same remembrance (or interest in the topic).  The other day I found this  this  explanation that vindicates my recollection (and I was continuously out of the U.S. from 1969 to 1973):

 
The question of which color to use for highway center lines in the United States enjoyed considerable debate and changing standards over a period of several decades. By November 1954, 47 states had adopted white as their standard color for highway centerlines, with Oregon being the last holdout to use yellow. In 1958, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads adopted white as the standard color for the new interstate highway system. The 1971 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, however, mandated yellow as the standard color o</p><p>3 0.12607929 <a title="988-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-25-Subsidized_driving.html">1693 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-25-Subsidized driving</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
 This DC Streets Blog post  gives a concise summary of a report by “The Tax Foundation”.  The money shot is  here , a table that shows what fraction spending on roads in each state in the U.S. is covered by local, state, and federal gas taxes, tolls, registration fees, etc. (Click on the ‘rank’ table heading to put it in useful order). The national average is 51%, and in no state do drivers directly pay more than 80% of the cost of the roads and highways. That means that, nationwide, half the cost of the roads is paid out of general government funds. Even if it were 100% this still wouldn’t cover additional government costs of driving (such as military spending to protect the oil supply, and law enforcement costs, etc.) but I’ll ignore those in this post.
 
Of course, most of the general funds that make up the difference are themselves paid by people who drive, so this isn’t as grossly unfair as it seems. But it’s still pretty unfair, and it is a huge “market di</p><p>4 0.119518 <a title="988-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-08-Traffic_Prediction.html">752 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-08-Traffic Prediction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What do Paul Samuelson and the U.S. Department of Transportation have in common?
 
Phil Price points us to  this  news article by Clark Williams-Derry:
  
As the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin points out, the US Department of Transportation has been making the virtually identical vehicle travel forecasts for well over a decade. All of those forecasts project rapid and incessant growth in vehicle travel for as far as the eye can see. Meanwhile, actual traffic volumes have flattened out, and may actually be falling.


 


Each of the rising colored lines represents a forecast from a different year.  The black line represents actual traffic trends on US roads—which never rose as quickly as the forecasters had predicted, and actually started a modest decline in 2007.
  
I’d like to see a label on the y-axis, and I’d recommend labeling the x-axis at 5-year intervals rather than every year, but the point seems pretty clear.

<p>Introduction: A  New York Times article  reports the opening of a half-mile section of bike path, recently built along the west side of Manhattan at a cost of $16M, or roughly $30 million per mile.  That’s about $5700 per linear foot.  Kinda sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?   
 
Well, $30 million per mile for about one car-lane mile is a lot, but it’s not out of line compared to other urban highway construction costs.  The Doyle Drive project in San Francisco — a freeway to replace the current old and deteriorating freeway approach to the Golden Gate Bridge — is currently under way at $1 billion for 1.6 miles…but hey, it will have six lanes each way, so that isn’t so bad, at $50 million per lane-mile.  And there are other components to the project, too, not just building the highway (there will also be bike paths, landscaping, on- and off-ramps, and so on).  All in all it seems roughly in line with the New York bike lane project.
 
Speaking of the Doyle Drive project, one expense was the cost of movin</p><p>3 0.83545095 <a title="988-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-16-Using_economics_to_reduce_bike_theft.html">1536 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-16-Using economics to reduce bike theft</a></p>

While bike theft is an epidemic in major US cities, most people seem resigned that it’s just a fact of life. . . . at Priceonomics, we thought we’d take a crack at trying to reduce bike theft. Could we use software to help people fight back against bike thieves?


Professional bike thieves exist because they can make a profit. Luckily, this author went to business school and remembers exactly one equation from the experience:


Profit = Revenue – Cost


From a criminal’s perspective, the “Cost” of bike theft is about zero. The odds of getting caught are negligible and the penalty is about zero as well. Most commentators suggest that in order to prevent bike theft, the government should increase the penalties to make it a less attractive crime. As we stated earlier, we somehow doubt government intervention is going to happen any time soon.


We decided to focus on the revenue half of the equation. Could we make it harder for bike thieves to turn their contraband</p><p>4 0.81252587 <a title="988-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-24-The_Used_TV_Price_is_Too_Damn_High.html">1342 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-24-The Used TV Price is Too Damn High</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV.

It turns out that most people don’t have a clue.  What about you?  Here, take this poll/quiz and then compare your answers to (1) what other people said, in a CNN poll that asked about these same items and (2) compare your answers to the real answers.
 
Quiz is below the fold.
  

 
The questions below are from  a CNN poll.  
 
========
 
Think about all the money that the federal government spent last year. I’m going to name a few federal programs and for each one, I’d like you to estimate what percentage of the federal government’s budget last year was spent on each of those programs.
  
 Medicare — the federal health program for the elderly 
 Medicaid — the federal health program for the poor 
 Social Security 
 Military spending by the Department of Defense 
 Aid to foreign countries for international development</p><p>6 0.80920231 <a title="988-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-More_on_that_Dartmouth_health_care_study.html">67 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-More on that Dartmouth health care study</a></p>

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.

A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>5 0.83144438 <a title="988-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-29-A_Ph.D._thesis_is_not_really_a_marathon.html">1351 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-29-A Ph.D. thesis is not really a marathon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
A blog called The Thesis Whisperer was recently pointed out to me. I [Basbøll] haven’t looked at it closely, but I’ll be reading it regularly for a while before I recommend it. I’m sure it’s a good place to go to discover that you’re not alone, especially when you’re struggling with your dissertation.  One post  caught my eye immediately. It suggested that writing a thesis is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.


As a metaphorical adjustment to a particular attitude about writing, it’s probably going to help some people. But if we think it through, it’s not really a very good analogy. No one is really a “sprinter”; and writing a dissertation is nothing like running a marathon. . . .


Here’s Ben’s explication of the analogy at the Thesis Whisperer, which seems initially plausible.

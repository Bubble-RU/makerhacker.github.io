<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.

<p>Introduction: I have this great talk on the above topic but nowhere to give it.
 
Here’s the story.  Several months ago, I was invited to speak at IEEE VisWeek.  It sounded like a great opportunity.  The organizer told me that there were typically about 700 people in the audience, and these are people in the visualization community whom I’d like to reach but normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to encounter.  It sounded great, but I didn’t want to fly most of the way across the country by myself, so I offered to give the talk by videolink.
 
I was surprised to get a No response:  I’d think that a visualization conference, of all things, would welcome a video talk.
 
In the meantime, though, I’d thought a lot about what I’d talk about and had started preparing something.  Once I found out I wouldn’t be giving the talk, I channeled the efforts into an article which, with the collaboration of Antony Unwin, was completed about a month ago.

<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

<p>Introduction: Somebody asked me to speak sometime at a data visualization meetup.  I think I spoke there a year or two ago but I could do it again.  Last time I spoke on  Infovis vs Statistical Graphics , this time I could just go thru the choices involved in a few zillion graphs I’ve published over the years, to give a sense of the options and choices involved in graphical communication.  For this talk there would be no single theme (except, perhaps, my usual “Graphs as comparisons,” “All of statistics as comparisons,” and “Exploratory data analysis as hypothesis testing”), just a bunch of open discussion about what I tried, why I tried it, what worked and what didn’t work, etc.  I’ve discussed these sorts of decisions on occasion (and am now writing a paper with Yair about some of this for our voting models), but I’ve never tried to make a talk out of it before.  Could be fun.</p><p>6 0.17061588 <a title="548-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-I_just_skyped_in_from_Kentucky%2C_and_boy_are_my_arms_tired.html">438 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-I just skyped in from Kentucky, and boy are my arms tired</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.  My talk</p><p>2 0.9234165 <a title="548-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-20-Andy_vs._the_Ideal_Point_Model_of_Voting.html">355 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-20-Andy vs. the Ideal Point Model of Voting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression   
book (p. 317), using the U.S. Senate instead of the Supreme Court, and 
ignoring the dis</p><p>3 0.92051136 <a title="548-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-21-Avoiding_boundary_estimates_in_linear_mixed_models.html">918 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-21-Avoiding boundary estimates in linear mixed models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pablo Verde sends in  this letter  he and Daniel Curcio just published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. They had published a meta-analysis with a boundary estimate which, he said, gave nonsense results.  Here’s Curcio and Verde’s key paragraph:
  
The authors [of the study they are criticizing] performed a test of heterogeneity between studies. Given that the test result was not significant at 5%, they decided to pool all the RRs by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in meta-analysis, which usually leads to very misleading results. First of all, the pooled RR as well as its standard	error are sensitive to 2 the estimation of the between-studies standard deviation (SD).	SD is difficult to estimate with a small number of studies. On the other hand, it is very well known that the significant test of hetero- geneity lacks statistical power to detect values of SD greater than zero. In addition, the statistically non-significant re</p><p>4 0.90819776 <a title="548-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-17-Distorting_the_Electoral_Connection%3F_Partisan_Representation_in_Confirmation_Politics.html">152 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-17-Distorting the Electoral Connection?

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>5 0.90789139 <a title="548-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-Getting_into_hot_water_over_hot_graphics.html">225 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-Getting into hot water over hot graphics</a></p>

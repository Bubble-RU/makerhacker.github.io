</p><p>3 Their gene is correlated with life satisfaction in their data and the correlation is statistically significant. [sent-18, score-0.751]
</p><p>4 The key to getting statistical significance is to treat life satisfaction as a continuous response rather than to pull out the highest category and call it a binary variable. [sent-19, score-0.507]
</p><p>5 That’s what I think they should report, rather than trying to use simulation to wrestle this into a claim about the probability of describing oneself as “very satisfied. [sent-26, score-0.281]
</p><p>6 ”   They claim that having the two alleles increases the probability of describing oneself as “very satisfied” by 17%. [sent-27, score-0.287]
</p><p>7 I mean, sure, the data are perfectly  consistent  with the linear model, but the nature of leverage is such that you really don’t get a good estimate on the curvature of the dose-response function. [sent-48, score-0.264]
</p><p>8 It’s fine, but I’d much prefer simply giving the two-allele estimate and then saying that the data are consistent with a linear model, rather than presenting the one-allele estimate as a separate number. [sent-51, score-0.451]
</p><p>9 The Independent’s  article  was titled, “Discovered: the genetic secret of a happy life,” and the Telegraph’s was  not much better :  “A “happiness gene” which has a strong influence on how satisfied people are with their lives, has been discovered. [sent-55, score-0.304]
</p><p>10 In section 3 of the Econometrica paper, they compare identical to fraternal twins (from the Adolescent Health survey, it appears) and estimate that 33% of the variation in reported life satisfaction is explained by genes. [sent-75, score-0.669]
</p><p>11 They also estimate 0% of the variation to be due to common environment, but again that 0% is gonna be a point estimate with a huge standard error. [sent-80, score-0.35]
</p><p>12 To me the point of these estimates is to show that the Adolescent Health data are  consistent with the literature on genes and happiness , thus supporting the decision to move on with the rest of their study. [sent-82, score-0.613]
</p><p>13 I understand that this is the gene that they expected to relate to happiness and life satisfaction, but . [sent-87, score-0.784]
</p><p>14 At the very least, the distribution of estimates over a large sample of genes would give some sense of the variation that might be expected. [sent-92, score-0.388]
</p><p>15 Are other gene variants already recorded for the Adolescent Health and Framingham participants? [sent-94, score-0.418]
</p><p>16 ’  Instead, there is likely to be a set of genes whose expression, in combination with environmental factors, influences subjective well-being. [sent-103, score-0.292]
</p><p>17 my guess is that the set of genes that influence subjective well-being is a very large number indeed! [sent-108, score-0.368]
</p><p>18 I’m sure that in a couple of decades we’ll have a much better understanding of genes and subjective well-being, but you have to start somewhere. [sent-115, score-0.352]
</p><p>19 This and my earlier blog on the happiness gene study required no special knowledge of subject matter or statistics. [sent-126, score-0.714]
</p><p>20 )  I probably could’ve done better with some prior knowledge–I know next to nothing about genetics and not much about happiness surveys either–but I could get pretty far just tracking down the statistics (and, as noted, without any goal of debunking or any need to make a grand statement).

<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups. In Europe, the poor and those on the left of the political spectru</p><p>4 0.18990554 <a title="706-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-02-Interaction-based_feature_selection_and_classification_for_high-dimensional_biological_data.html">1703 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-02-Interaction-based feature selection and classification for high-dimensional biological data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Esteban writes:
  
In your blog your advice for performing regression  in the presence of large numbers of correlated features, has been to use composite scores and hierarchical modeling. Unfortunately, many problems don’t provide an obvious and unambiguous way of grouping features together (e.g. gene expression data). Are there any techniques that you would recommend that automatically pool correlated features together based on the data, without requiring the researcher to manually define composite scores or feature hierarchies?
  
I don’t know the answer to this but I imagine something is possible . . . any ideas? 
   
In the meantime I’m reminded of  this recent article  by Shaw-Hwa Lo, Haitian Wang, Tian Zheng, and Inchi Hu:

<p>Introduction: A couple people pointed me to  this recent news article  which discusses “why, beyond middle age, people get happier as they get older.”  Here’s the story:
  
When people start out on adult life, they are, on average, pretty cheerful. Things go downhill from youth to middle age until they reach a nadir commonly known as the mid-life crisis. So far, so familiar. The surprising part happens after that. Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasure–vitality, mental sharpness and looks–they also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.


This curious finding has emerged from a new branch of economics that seeks a more satisfactory measure than money of human well-being. Conventional economics uses money as a proxy for utility–the dismal way in which the discipline talks about happiness. But some economists, unconvinced that there is a direct relationship between money and well-being, have decided to go to the nub of the matter and measure happiness i</p><p>6 0.18654291 <a title="706-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-07-Happy_news_on_happiness%3B_what_can_we_believe%3F.html">1305 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-07-Happy news on happiness; what can we believe?</a></p>

You’ve probably already seen it, but I thought you could have a lot of fun with this one!!
  
 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years. We found no correlation between spouses’ automatic and conscious attitu</p><p>4 0.80730319 <a title="706-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Controversy_about_average_personality_differences_between_men_and_women.html">1114 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Controversy about average personality differences between men and women</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).

<p>Introduction: Thomas Lumley  writes :
  
 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>6 0.79690617 <a title="706-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-26-%E2%80%9CPlease_make_fun_of_this_claim%E2%80%9D.html">2114 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-26-“Please make fun of this claim”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I saw an analysis recently that I didn’t like.  I won’t go into the details, but basically it was a dose-response inference, where a continuous exposure was binned into three broad categories (terciles of the data) and the probability of an adverse event was computed for each tercile.  The effect and the sample size was large enough that the terciles were statistically-significantly different from each other in probability of adverse event, with the probabilities increasing from low to mid to high exposure, as one would predict.
 
I didn’t like this analysis because it is equivalent to fitting a step function.  There is a tendency for people to interpret the (arbitrary) tercile boundaries as being meaningful thresholds even though the underlying dose-response relation has to be continuous.  I’d prefer to start with a linear model and then add nonlinearity from there with a spline or whatever.
 
At this point I stepped back and thought:  Hey, the divide-into-three analysis does not lite</p><p>2 0.98796803 <a title="706-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-10-R_vs._Stata%2C_or%2C_Different_ways_to_estimate_multilevel_models.html">269 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-10-R vs. Stata, or, Different ways to estimate multilevel models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cyrus writes:
  
I [Cyrus] was teaching a class on multilevel modeling, and we were playing around with different method to fit a random effects logit model with 2 random intercepts—one corresponding to “family” and another corresponding to “community” (labeled “mom” and “cluster” in the data, respectively).  There are also a few regressors at the individual, family, and community level.  We were replicating in part some of the results from the  following paper :  Improved estimation procedures for multilevel models with binary response: a case-study, by G Rodriguez, N Goldman.


(I say “replicating in part” because we didn’t include all the regressors that they use, only a subset.)  We were looking at the performance of estimation via glmer in R’s lme4 package, glmmPQL in R’s MASS package, and Stata’s xtmelogit.  We wanted to study the performance of various estimation methods, including adaptive quadrature methods and penalized quasi-likelihood.

<p>Introduction: Faithful readers will know that my ideal alternative career is to be an editor in the Max Perkins mold.  If not that, I think I’d enjoy being a literary essayist, someone like Alfred Kazin or Edmund Wilson or Louis Menand, who could write about my favorite authors and books in a forum where others would read and discuss what I wrote.  I could occasionally collect my articles into books, and so on.  On the other hand, if I actually had such a career, I wouldn’t have much of an option to do statistical research in my spare time, so I think for my own broader goals, I’ve gotten hold of the right side of the stick.
 
As it is, I enjoy writing about literary matters but it never quite seems worth spending the time to do it right.  (And, stepping outside myself, I realize that I have a lot more to offer the world as a statistician than literary critic.  Criticism is like musicianship–it can be hard to do, and it’s impressive when done well, but a lot of people can do it.

<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.

<p>Introduction: Several people have asked me what I thought of  this .  For example, one colleague wrote:
  
I thought you might find data of this quantity and quality as interesting as I do.


In their latest blog entry, okcupid uses its very large dating-site userbase to assess the progression of social and economic views with age, and (taking into account self-specified importance of economic and social views) the resulting political affiliations.  The final assessment is that the spectrum of views encompassed under “democrat” ends up being much broader than those under “republican”.  I’ve seen this mentioned many times before, but I have never seen such pretty data illustrating the phenomenon.  Perhaps this is more graphics to impress, rather than graphics in a typical statistical setting, but I find them captivating nonetheless. In any case, I would be curious to hear your opinions of this.

<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson writes:
  
On the criteria of potential to help people avoid death,  this  would seem to be among the most important news I’ve ever heard. 
   
 [In his  recent Ph.D. thesis , Ken Lee finds that] death rates depend on job details more than on race, gender, marriage status, rural vs. urban, education, and income  combined !  Now for the details.


The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>4 0.17084049 <a title="775-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-20-Likelihood_thresholds_and_decisions.html">1422 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-20-Likelihood thresholds and decisions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg points me to  this  discussion:
  
Martin Strasbourg and I [Hogg] discussed his project to detect new satellites of M31 in the PAndAS survey. He can construct a likelihood ratio (possibly even a marginalized likelihood ratio) at every position in the M31 imaging, between the best-fit satellite-plus-background model and the best nothing-plus-background model. He can make a two-dimensional map of these likelihood ratios and show a the histogram of them. Looking at this histogram, which has a tail to very large ratios, he asked me, where should I put my cut? That is, at what likelihood ratio does a candidate deserve follow-up? Here’s my unsatisfying answer:


To a statistician, the distribution of likelihood ratios is interesting and valuable to study. To an astronomer, it is uninteresting. You don’t want to know the distribution of likelihoods, you want to find satellites . . .

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  news article and asks, Can this be right?
 
Hmmm . . . the article defines “wealthier smokers” as “those earning 60,000 or more.”  So suppose a “low-income smoker” makes $20K, then 25% is $5000, which is $100 a week, or $14/day, which according to the article is roughly the cost of a pack of cigarettes.  So I guess it’s possible.  It just depends where you put the cutoff for “low-income” and where you put the cutoff for “smoker.”  I also wonder whether the numerator and denominator are comparable.  It might be that if you add up all of these people’s expenses and divide by their income, you’ll get a ratio of more than 100%.</p><p>6 0.12462186 <a title="775-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-05-More_plain_old_everyday_Bayesianism.html">1926 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-05-More plain old everyday Bayesianism</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein asks for my thoughts as  a Bayesian on the above topic.  So here they are (briefly):
 
The concept of the bias-variance tradeoff can be useful if you don’t take it too seriously.  The basic idea is as follows:  if you’re estimating something, you can slice your data finer and finer, or perform more and more adjustments, each time getting a purer—and less biased—estimate.  But each subdivision or each adjustment reduces your sample size or increases potential estimation error, hence the variance of your estimate goes up.
 
That story is real.  In lots and lots of examples, there’s a continuum between a completely unadjusted general estimate (high bias, low variance) and a specific, focused, adjusted estimate (low bias, high variance).

<p>Introduction: Aki and I  write :
  
The very generality of the boostrap creates both opportunity and peril, allowing researchers to solve otherwise intractable problems but also sometimes leading to an answer with an inappropriately high level of certainty.


We demonstrate with two examples from our own research:  one problem where bootstrap smoothing was effective and led us to an improved method, and another case where bootstrap smoothing would not solve the underlying problem.  Our point in these examples is not to disparage bootstrapping but rather to gain insight into where it will be more or less effective as a smoothing tool.


 An example where bootstrap smoothing works well

<p>Introduction: I received the following note from someone who’d like to remain anonymous: 
  
  
I read  your post  on ethics and statistics, and the comments therein, with much interest.


I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?

<p>Introduction: Ratio estimates are common in statistics.  In survey sampling, the ratio estimate is when you use y/x to estimate Y/X (using the notation in which x,y are totals of sample measurements and X,Y are population totals).
 
In textbook sampling examples, the denominator X will be an all-positive variable, something that is easy to measure and is, ideally, close to proportional to Y.  For example, X is last year’s sales and Y is this year’s sales, or X is the number of people in a cluster and Y is some count.
 
Ratio estimation doesn’t work so well if X can be either positive or negative.
 
More generally we can consider any estimate of a ratio, with no need for a survey sampling context.  The problem with estimating Y/X is that the very interpretation of Y/X can change completely if the sign of X changes.
 
Everything is ok for a point estimate:  you get X.hat and Y.hat, you can take the ratio Y.hat/X.hat, no problem.  But the inference falls apart if you have enough uncertainty in X.hat th</p><p>2 0.96335995 <a title="775-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-11-Using_the_%E2%80%9Cinstrumental_variables%E2%80%9D_or_%E2%80%9Cpotential_outcomes%E2%80%9D_approach_to_clarify_causal_thinking.html">1492 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-11-Using the “instrumental variables” or “potential outcomes” approach to clarify causal thinking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.  Computer science student Elias Bareinboim gave the following example:  “suppose we know nothing a</p><p>3 0.95103073 <a title="775-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-19-The_scope_for_snooping.html">1070 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-19-The scope for snooping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys sent the following question to David Madigan and me: 
  
  
I am working on a piece on the registration of research designs (to prevent snooping). As part of it we want to give some estimates for the “scope for snooping” and how this can be affected by different registration requirements.


So we want to answer questions of the form: 
“Say in truth there is no relation between x and y, you were willing to mess about with models until you found a significant relation between them, what are the chances that you would succeed if: 
1. You were free to choose the indicators for x and y 
2. You were free to choose h control variable from some group of k possible 
controls 
3. You were free to divide up the sample in k ways to examine heterogeneous treatment effects 
4. You were free to select from some set of k reasonable models”

<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>5 0.94774377 <a title="775-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-01-A_graph_at_war_with_its_caption.__Also%2C_how_to_visualize_the_same_numbers_without_giving_the_display_a_misleading_causal_feel%3F.html">1834 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-01-A graph at war with its caption.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  discusses  the following  graph  that is captioned, “A study of 54 nations–ranked below–found that those with more progressive tax rates had happier citizens, on average.”
 
   
 
As Kaiser writes, “from a purely graphical perspective, the chart is well executed . . . they have 54 points, and the chart still doesn’t look too crammed . . .”  But he also points out that the graph’s implicit claims (that tax rates can explain happiness or cause more happiness) are not supported.
 
Kaiser and I are not being picky-picky-picky here.  Taken literally, the graph title says nothing about causation, but I think the phrasing implies it.  Also, from a purely descriptive perspective, the graph is somewhat at war with its caption.  The caption announces a relationship, but in the graph, the x and y variables have only a very weak correlation.  The caption says that happiness and progressive tax rates go together, but the graph uses the U.S. as a baseline, and when you move from the U.S</p><p>6 0.94617176 <a title="775-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-25-Correlation_of_1_._._._too_good_to_be_true%3F.html">1737 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-25-Correlation of 1 . . . too good to be true?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:

<p>Introduction: One of the most satisfying experiences for an academic is when someone asks a question that you’ve already answered.  This happened in the comments today.

So for applied stat courses like for sociologists, political scientists, psychologists and maybe also for economics, what do we actually want to accomplish with our intro courses? And how would it help to include Bayesian Statistics in them?
  
And I was like, hey!  This reminds me of a paper I published a few years ago, “Teaching Bayesian applied statistics to graduate students in political science, sociology, public health, education, economics, . . .”
 
 Here it is , and it begins as follows:
  
I was trying to draw Bert and Ernie the other day, and it was really difficult.

Steps include “Make whimsical sparkles by drawing an ellipse using the Ellipse Tool,” “Rotate the sparkles . . . Give some sparkles less Opacity by using the Transparency Palette,” and “Add a haze around each sparkle by drawing a white ellipse using the Ellipse Tool.”
 
The punchline:
  
Now, the next time you need to include a boring graph in one of your designs you’ll be able to add some extra emphasis and get people to really pay attention to those numbers!

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>3 0.83082533 <a title="1056-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-01-%E2%80%9COn_Inspiring_Students_and_Being_Human%E2%80%9D.html">1517 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-01-“On Inspiring Students and Being Human”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.  That ain’t right.  Let the student hold the pen.

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Jim Hodges posted a note to the Bugs mailing list that I thought could be of more general interest: 
  
  
Is multi-modality a common experience?  I [Hodges] think the answer is “nobody knows in any generality”.  Here are some examples of bimodality that certainly do *not* involve the kind of labeling problems that arise in mixture models.


The only systematic study of multimodality I know of is 


Liu J, Hodges JS (2003).  Posterior bimodality in the balanced one-way random effects model.  J.~Royal Stat.~Soc., Ser.~B, 65:247-255.


The surprise of this paper is that in the simplest possible hierarchical model (analyzed using the standard inverse-gamma priors for the two variances), bimodality occurs quite readily, although it is much less common to have two modes that are big enough so that you’d actually get a noticeable fraction of MCMC draws from both of them.  Because the restricted likelihood (= the marginal posterior for the two variances, if you’ve put flat priors on them) is</p><p>2 0.93094754 <a title="1056-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-Samurai_sword-wielding_Mormon_bishop_pharmaceutical_statistician_stops_mugger.html">1822 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-Samurai sword-wielding Mormon bishop pharmaceutical statistician stops mugger</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points us to  this  feel-good story of the day:
  
A Samurai sword-wielding Mormon bishop helped a neighbor woman escape a Tuesday morning attack by a man who had been stalking her.


Kent Hendrix woke up Tuesday to his teenage son pounding on his bedroom door and telling him somebody was being mugged in front of their house. The 47-year-old father of six rushed out the door and grabbed the weapon closest to him — a 29-inch high carbon steel Samurai sword. . . .


Hendrix, a pharmaceutical statistician, was one of several neighbors who came to the woman’s aid after she began yelling for help . . .
  
Too bad the whole “statistician” thing got buried in the middle of the article.  Fair enough, though:  I don’t know what it takes to become a Mormon bishop, but I assume it’s more effort than what it takes to learn statistics.</p><p>3 0.93041706 <a title="1056-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-19-Sharon_Begley%3A__Worse_than_Stephen_Jay_Gould%3F.html">1128 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-19-Sharon Begley:  Worse than Stephen Jay Gould?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Tggp  links  to a criticism of science journalist Sharon Begley by science journalist Matthew Hutson.  I learned of this dispute after reporting that Begley had received the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, a completely undeserved honor, if Hutson is to believed.
 
The two journalists have somewhat similar profiles: Begley was science editor at Newsweek (she’s now at Reuters) and author of “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves,” and Hutson was news editor at Psychology Today and wrote the similarly self-helpy-titled, “The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane.”
 
Hutson  writes :

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points us to  an article  by Shaaron Ainsworth, Vaughan Prain, and Russell Tytler:
  
Should science learners be challenged to draw more? Certainly making visualizations is integral to scientific thinking. Scientists do not use words only but rely on diagrams, graphs, videos, photographs, and other images to make discoveries, explain findings, and excite public interest. . . . However, in the science classroom, learners mainly focus on interpreting others’ visualizations; when drawing does occur, it is rare that learners are systematically encouraged to create their own visual forms to develop and show understanding (6). Drawing includes constructing a line graph from a table of values, sketching cells observed through a microscope, or inventing a way to show a scientific phenomenon (e.g., evaporation). Although interpretation of visualizations and other information is clearly critical to learning, becoming proficient in science also requires learners to develop many</p><p>5 0.92067271 <a title="1056-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-What_are_the_trickiest_models_to_fit%3F.html">575 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-What are the trickiest models to fit?</a></p>

What do you and your readers think are the trickiest models to fit? If I had an algorithm that I claimed could fit many models with little fuss, what kinds of models would really impress you? I am interested in testing different MCMC sampling methods to evaluate their performance and I want to stretch the bounds of their abilities.
  
I don’t know what’s the trickiest, but just about anything I work on in a serious way gives me some troubles.

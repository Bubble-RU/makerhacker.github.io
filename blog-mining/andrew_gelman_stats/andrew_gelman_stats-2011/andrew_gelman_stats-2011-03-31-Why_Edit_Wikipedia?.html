<p>Introduction: The other day someone mentioned my complaint about the Wikipedia article on “Bayesian inference” (see footnote 1 of  this article ) and he said I should fix the Wikipedia entry myself.
 
And  so I did .  I didn’t have the energy to rewrite the whole article–in particular, all of its examples involve discrete parameters, whereas the Bayesian problems I work on generally have continuous parameters, and its “mathematical foundations” section focuses on “independent identically distributed observations x” rather than data y which can have different distributions.  It’s just a wacky, unbalanced article.  But I altered the first few paragraphs to get rid of the stuff about the posterior probability that a model is true.
 
I much prefer the  Scholarpedia article on Bayesian statistics  by David Spiegelhalter and Kenneth Rice, but I couldn’t bring myself to simply delete the Wikipedia article and replace it with the Scholarpedia content.

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar writes:
  
The Priceonomics blog is doing a feature where we ask a few economists what they think of the the institution of tenure. If you’d be interested in participating, I’d love to get your response.


As an economist, what do you think of tenure? Should it be abolished / kept / modified?
  
My reply:  Just to be clear, I’m assuming that when you say “tenure,” you’re talking about lifetime employment for college professors such as myself.
 
I’m actually a political scientist, not an economist.  So rather than giving my opinion, I’ll say what I think an economist might say.
 
I think an economist could say one of two things:
 
Economist as anthropologist would say:  Tenure is decided by independent institutions acting freely.  If they choose to offer tenure, they will have good reasons, and it is not part of an economist’s job to second-guess individual decisions.
 
Economist as McKinsey consultant would say: Tenure can be evaluated based on a cost-benefit analysis.

<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

<p>Introduction: Journalist Jonathan Rauch  writes  that the internet is Sturgeon squared:
  
This is the blogosphere. I’m not getting paid to be here. I’m here to get incredibly famous (in my case, even more incredibly famous) so that I can get paid somewhere else. . . .


The average quality of newspapers and (published) novels is far, far better than the average quality of blog posts (and–ugh!–comments). This is because people pay for newspapers and novels. What distinguishes newspapers and novels is how much does not get published in them, because people won’t pay for it. Payment is a filter, and a pretty good one. Imperfect, of course. But pointing out the defects of the old model is merely changing the subject if the new model is worse. . . .


Yes, the new model is bringing a lot of new content into being. But most of it is bad. And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. Even in the information economy, there’s no free lunch. . . .


Yes, there’s g</p><p>4 0.80394703 <a title="640-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-What_is_expected_of_a_consultant.html">1597 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-What is expected of a consultant</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.

<p>Introduction: Dave Kane writes:
  
I [Kane] am involved in a dispute relating to whether or not a blog can be considered part of one’s academic writing.  Williams College restricts the use of undergraduate theses as follows:

 
Non-commercial, academic use within the scope of “Fair Use” standards is acceptable. Otherwise, you may not copy or distribute any content without the permission of the copyright holder.
 

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.
      
Parenthetically, your readers might be interested in the substantive discovery here, the details of the Williams admissions process (which is probably very similar to Columbia’s). Williams places students into academic rating (AR) categories as follows:

<p>Introduction: 1.  Freakonomics  characterizes  drunk driving as an example of “the human tendency to worry about rare problems that are unlikely to happen.”
 
2.  The CDC  reports , “Alcohol-impaired drivers are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.”
 
No offense to the tenured faculty at the University of Chicago, but I’m going with the CDC on this one. 
   
P.S.  The Freakonomics blog deserves to be dinged another time, not just for claiming, based on  implausible assumptions  and making the all-else-equal  fallacy  that “drunk walking is 8 times more likely to result in your death than drunk driving” but for presenting this weak inference as a fact rather than as a speculation.
 
When doing “Freakonomics,” you can be counterintuitive, or you can be sensible, but it’s hard to be both. I mean, sure, sometimes you can be. But there’s a tradeoff, and in this case, they’re choosing to push the envelope on counterintuitiveness.</p><p>3 0.96397471 <a title="640-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Question_21_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1356 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Question 21 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions.. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
 
 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>4 0.9555831 <a title="640-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-13-A_real-life_dollar_auction_game%21.html">1532 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-13-A real-life dollar auction game!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sharon Otterman  reports :
  
When report card grades were released in the fall for the city’s 455 high schools, the highest score went to a small school in a down-and-out section of the Bronx . . . A stunning 94 percent of its seniors graduated, more than 30 points above the citywide average. . . . “When I interviewed for the school,” said Sam Buchbinder, a history teacher, “it was made very clear: this is a school that doesn’t believe in anyone failing.”


That statement was not just an exhortation to excellence. It was school policy.


By order of the principal, codified in the school’s teacher handbook, all teachers should grade their classes in the same way: 30 percent of students should earn a grade in the A range, 40 percent B’s, 25 percent C’s, and no more than 5 percent D’s. As long as they show up, they should not fail.

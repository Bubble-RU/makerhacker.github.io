Fluids are turbulent when tiny differences in space or time make for gross differences in behavior. The mathematical signature of turbulence is an endless moment or cumulant hierarchy. Bayesian tracking of continuous-time processes turns out to have a similar mathematical structure. As a result, tiny doubts about regime change or tiny errors in estimation or calculation are prone under stress to balloon into gross differences of opinion. In effect, reasonable people are bound to disagree. This finding has profound implications for our understanding of financial markets and other instruments of social learning. In particular it explains forecast degradation, frequent trading, excess volatility, and GARCH behavior without imputing widespread irrationality. Rational learning makes markets turbulent.

<p>Introduction: A student writes:
  
I am new to Bayesian methods.  While I am reading your book, I have some questions for you.  I am interested in doing Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression (e.g., random-intercept model) and Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM)—for causality.  Do you happen to know if I could find some articles, where authors could provide data w/ R and/or BUGS codes that I could replicate them?
  
My reply:  For Bayesian hierarchical (multi-level) linear regression and causal inference, see my book with Jennifer Hill.  For Bayesian structural equation modeling, try google and you’ll find some good stuff.  Also, I recommend Stan (http://mc-stan.org/) rather than Bugs.</p><p>5 0.16310824 <a title="792-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-03-%E2%80%9CRationality%E2%80%9D_reinforces%2C_does_not_compete_with%2C_other_models_of_behavior.html">692 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-03-“Rationality” reinforces, does not compete with, other models of behavior</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Sides  followed up  on a discussion of his  earlier claim  that political independents vote for president in a reasonable way based on economic performance.  John’s original post led to the amazing claim by New Republic writer Jonathan Chait that John wouldn’t “even want to be friends with anybody who” voted in this manner.
 
I’ve been sensitive to discussions of rationality and voting ever since Aaron Edlin, Noah Kaplan, and I wrote  our article  on voting as a rational choice:  why and how people vote to improve the well-being of others.
 
Models of rationality are controversial In politics, just as they are in other fields ranging from economics to criminology.  On one side you have people trying to argue that all behavior is rational, from lottery playing to drug addiction to engaging in email with exiled Nigerian royalty.  Probably the only behavior that nobody has yet to claim is rational is blogging, but I bet that’s coming too.

<p>Introduction: Kevin Bryan wrote:
  
I read  your new article  on deduction/induction under Bayes.  There are a couple interesting papers from economic decision theory which are related that you might find interesting.
      
Samuelson et al have a (very) recent paper about what happens when you have some Bayesian and some non-Bayesian hypotheses.  (I  mentioned  this one on my blog earlier this year.)  Essentially, the Bayesian hypotheses are forced to “make predictions” in every future period (“if the unemployment rate is x%, the president is reelected with pr=x), whereas other forms of reasoning (say, analogies: “If the unemployment rate is above 10%, the president will not be reelected”).  Imagine you have some prior over, say, the economy and elections, with 99.9% of the hypotheses being Bayesian and the rest being analogies as above.  Then 100 years from now, because the analogies are so hard to refute, using deduction will push the proportion of Bayesian hypotheses toward zero.

<p>Introduction: Econometrician and statistician Dale Poirier writes:
  
24 years ago (1988, Journal of Economics Perspectives) I [Poirier] noted cognitive dissonance among some economists who treat the agents in their theoretical framework as Bayesians, but then analyze the data (even in the same paper!) as a frequentist. Recently, I have found similar cases in cognitive science. I suspect other disciplines exhibit such behavior. Do you know of any examples in political science?
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know of any such examples in political science.  Game theoretic models are popular in poli sci, but I haven’t seen much in the way of models of Bayesian decision making.
 
Here are two references (not in political science) that might be helpful.
 
1.  I have  argued  that the utility model (popular in economics and political science as a way of providing “microfoundations” for analyses of aggregate behavior) is actually more of a bit of folk-psychology that should not be taken seriously.

<p>Introduction: David Schminovich points me to  this paper  by Yu Lu, H. Mo, Martin Weinberg, and Neal Katz:
  
We believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape the observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions. The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. . . .
  
And here’s  another  from the same authors, this time on “Bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the K-band luminosity function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation.”

Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>3 0.92667907 <a title="792-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-A.I._is_Whatever_We_Can%E2%80%99t_Yet_Automate.html">634 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-A.I. is Whatever We Can’t Yet Automate</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common aphorism among artificial intelligence practitioners is that A.I. is whatever machines can’t currently do.  
 
Adam Gopnik, writing for the  New Yorker , has a review called  Get Smart  in the most recent issue (4 April 2011).  Ostensibly, the piece is a review of new books, one by Joshua Foer,  Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything , and one by Stephen Baker  Final Jeopardy: Man vs. Machine and the Quest to Know Everything  (which would explain Baker’s spate of  Jeopardy!-related blog posts ).  But like many such pieces in highbrow magazines, the book reviews are just a cover for staking out a philosophical position.  Gopnik does a typically  New Yorker  job in explaining the title of this blog post.
  

 
Gopnik describes his mother as “a logician, linguist, and early Fortran speaker” and goes on to add that she worked on an early machine translation project in Canada.  I’m guessing she’s the Myrna Gopnik behind  this 1968 COLING paper  (LE</p><p>same-blog 4 0.9227379 <a title="792-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-The_virtues_of_incoherence%3F.html">792 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-The virtues of incoherence?</a></p>

I just read your article  The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis . I agree on the importance of what you flagged as “comparable incoherence in all other statistical philosophies”. The problem arises when a string of unexpected observations persuades that one’s original structural hypothesis (which might be viewed as a parameter describing the type of statistical relationship) was false. 


However, I would phrase this more positively. Your Bayesian prior actually cedes alternative structural hypotheses, albeit with tiny epsilon weights. Otherwise you would never change your mind. However, these epsilons are so difficult to measure, and small differences can have such a significant impact on speed of adjustment (as in the example in Chapter 7 of Pandora’s Risk), that effectively we all look incoherent. This is a prime example of rational turbulence. 


Rational turbulence can arise even without a structural break.

<p>Introduction: One of my left-wing colleagues pointed me to  this  Fox TV interview in which UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose expresses displeasure with having his research criticized by liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America.
 
My colleague thought it was irresponsible and unprofessional for Groseclose to get all indignant about the criticism.  But I understood.  I remember how after the state Attorney General’s office released the study Jeff Fagan and I did on police stops ( see here  for the research-paper version), we were viciously attacked.  Some creep from the NYC Law Department sent a nasty letter full of accusations that were . . . I’d say “bullshit” but I don’t want to say that because “bullshit” contains the word “shit” and I don’t want to use profanity on this blog . . . anyway, this lawyer creep sent us an aggressive letter with bogus claims about our research competence.

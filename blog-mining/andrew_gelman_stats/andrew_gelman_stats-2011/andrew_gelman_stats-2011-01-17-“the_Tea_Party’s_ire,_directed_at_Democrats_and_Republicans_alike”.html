<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.  The disturbing thing about the whole process wasn’t so much that the Tea Partiers were irrational as that th</p><p>4 0.1644621 <a title="521-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-05-2010%3A__What_happened%3F.html">394 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-05-2010:  What happened?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.  But, as I’ve emphasized before</p><p>5 0.14447229 <a title="521-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-14-1.5_million_people_were_told_that_extreme_conservatives_are_happier_than_political_moderates.__Approximately_.0001_million_Americans_learned_that_the_opposite_is_true..html">1458 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-14-1.5 million people were told that extreme conservatives are happier than political moderates.  Approximately .0001 million Americans learned that the opposite is true.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A Brooks op-ed  in the New York Times (circulation approximately 1.5 million):
  
People at the extremes are happier than political moderates. . . . none, it seems, are happier than the Tea Partiers . . .
  
 Jay Livingston  on his blog (circulation approximately 0 (rounding to the nearest million)), giving data from the 2009-2010 General Social Survey, which is the usual place people turn to for population data on happiness of Americans:
  
   


The GSS does not offer “bitter” or “Tea Party” as choices, but extreme conservatives are nearly three times as likely as others to be “not too happy.”
  
Livingston reports that the sample size for “Extremely Conservative” here is 80.  Thus the standard error for that green bar on the right is approx sqrt(0.3*0.7/80)=0.05.
 
So how could Brooks have made such a mistake?  I can think of two possibilities:
 
1.  Brooks has some other data source that directly addresses the happiness of supporters of the Tea Party movement.
 
2.  Brooks looked a</p><p>6 0.13601075 <a title="521-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-10-What_happens_when_the_Democrats_are_%E2%80%9Cfighting_Wall_Street_with_one_hand%2C_unions_with_the_other%2C%E2%80%9D_while_the_Republicans_are_fighting_unions_with_two_hands%3F.html">79 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-10-What happens when the Democrats are “fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other,” while the Republicans are fighting unions with two hands?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>5 0.87713659 <a title="521-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Two_stories_about_the_election_that_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">384 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Two stories about the election that I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>6 0.8511377 <a title="521-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-20-No_no_no_no_no.html">1020 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-20-No no no no no</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Lilla recalls some recent Barack Obama quotes and then  writes :
  
If this is the way the president and his party think about human psychology, it’s little wonder they’ve taken such a beating.
  
In the spirit of that old line, “That and $4.95 will get you a tall latte,” let me agree with Lilla and attribute the Democrats’ losses in 2010 to the following three factors:
 
1.  A poor understanding of human psychology;
 
2.  The Democrats holding unified control of the presidency and congress with a large majority in both houses (factors that are historically associated with big midterm losses); and
 
3.  A terrible economy.
 
I will let you, the readers, make your best guesses as to the relative importance of factors 1, 2, and 3 above.
 
Don’t get me wrong:  I think psychology is important, as is the history of ideas (the main subject of Lilla’s article), and I’d hope that Obama (and also his colleagues in both parties in congress) can become better acquainted with psychology, moti</p><p>2 0.99793535 <a title="521-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-17-Graphical_tools_for_understanding_multilevel_models.html">772 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-17-Graphical tools for understanding multilevel models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a few things I want to do:
 
1.  Understand a fitted model using tools such as  average predictive comparisons ,  R-squared, and partial pooling factors .  In defining these concepts, Iain and I came up with some clever tricks, including (but not limited to):
 
- Separating the inputs and averaging over all possible values of the input not being altered (for average predictive comparisons);
 
- Defining partial pooling  without  referring to a raw-data or maximum-likelihood or no-pooling estimate (these don’t necessarily exist when you’re fitting logistic regression with sparse data);
 
- Defining an R-squared for each level of a multilevel model.
 
The methods get pretty complicated, though, and they have some loose ends–in particular, for average predictive comparisons with continuous input variables.
 
So now we want to implement these in R and put them into arm along with bglmer etc.

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email: 
  
  
Hi Andrew,

 
 
I work on the business development team of FindTheData.org, an unbiased comparison engine founded by Kevin O’Connor (founder and former CEO of DoubleClick) and backed by Kleiner Perkins with ~10M unique visitors per month. 
 We are working with large online publishers including Golf Digest, Huffington Post, Under30CEO, and offer a variety of options to integrate our highly engaging content with your site.  I believe our un-biased and reliable data resources would be of interest to you and your readers. 
 I’d like to set up a quick call to discuss similar partnership ideas with you and would greatly appreciate 10 minutes of your time. 
 Please suggest a couple times that work best for you or let me know if you would like me to send some more information before you make time for a call. 
 Looking forward to hearing from you, 
 Jonny

<p>Introduction: 2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.
 
(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.
 
(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.
 
(d) With a small sample size, you cannot hope to learn anything conclusive, but you can get a crude estimate of effect size and standard deviation which will be useful in a power analysis to help you decide how large your full study needs to be.
 
(e) You can talk with survey respondents and get a sense of how they perceived your questions.
 
(f) You get a chance to learn about practical difficulties with sampling, nonresponse, and question wording.
 
(g) You can check if your sample is approximately representative of your population.

<p>Introduction: John Sides  discusses  how his scatterplot of unionization rates and budget deficits made it onto cable TV news:
  
It’s also interesting to see how he [journalist Chris Hayes] chooses to explain a scatterplot — especially given the evidence that people don’t always understand scatterplots. He compares pairs of cases that don’t illustrate the basic hypothesis of Brooks, Scott Walker, et al. Obviously, such comparisons could be misleading, but given that there was no systematic relationship depicted that graph, these particular comparisons are not.
  
This idea–summarizing a bivariate pattern by comparing pairs of points–reminds me of a well-known statistical identities which I refer to in  a paper  with David Park:
 
 
 
John Sides is certainly correct that if you can pick your pair of points, you can make extremely misleading comparisons.  But if you pick  every  pair of points, and average over them appropriately, you end up with the least-squares regression slope.

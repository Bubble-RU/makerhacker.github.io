<p>Introduction: Red State Blue State:  How Will the U.S. Vote? 
 
It’s the “annual Halloween and pre-election extravaganza” of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and they suggested I could talk on the zombies paper (of course), but I thought the material on voting might be of more general interest.
 
The “How will the U.S. vote?” subtitle was not of my choosing, but I suppose I can add a few slides about the forthcoming election.
 
Fri 29 Oct 2010, 7pm in Ward I, in the basement of the Ward Circle building.
 
Should be fun.  I haven’t been to AU since taking a class there, over 30 years ago.
 
P.S.  It was indeed fun.   Here’s  the talk.  I did end up briefly describing my zombie research but it didn’t make it into any of the slides.</p><p>3 0.68148059 <a title="821-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happene</p><p>4 0.64955103 <a title="821-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-My_talk_last_night_at_the_visualization_meetup.html">1673 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-My talk last night at the visualization meetup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It  went pretty well, especially considering it was an  entirely new talk  (even though, paradoxically, all the images were old), and even though I had a tough act to follow:  I came on immediately after an excellent short presentation by Jed Dougherty on some cool information and visualization software that he and his colleagues are building for social workers.
 
The only problems with my were:
 
(a) I planned to elicit more audience involvement but didn’t do it. It would’ve been easy:  at any point I could’ve just paused and had the audience members work in pairs to come up with suggested improvements to any of my graphs.  But I forgot to do it.
 
(b) I went on too long.  The talk was going so well, I didn’t stop.  In retrospect, it would’ve been better to stop earlier.  Better for people to leave the table hungry than stuffed.
 
Also, next time I’ll drop the bit about the nuns-in-prison movies.

<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.

<p>Introduction: At Picnic Cafe, Broadway at 101 St, 6-7pm today.
  
Should we vote even though it probably won’t make a difference? Why is the question “Are we better off now than four years ago?” not an appeal to selfishness? Are Americans as polarized as we think? Come explore these and other questions about voting in America today.
  
It’s the usual stuff but close-up so lots of opportunity to argue and heckle.  No slides or graphs.  My plan is to hand out 30-50 index cards, each with a phrase (for example, “Moderation in the pursuit of moderation is no vice” or “Gerrymandering is good for you” or “How to predict elections”), then participants can call out topics and I’ll yap on them (with discussion) till we run out of time.
 
It’ll be weird to talk without graphs.  We’ll see how it goes.</p><p>2 0.80013144 <a title="821-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-27-Thin_scientists_say_it%E2%80%99s_unhealthy_to_be_fat.html">1741 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-27-Thin scientists say it’s unhealthy to be fat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Even as you get near the upper reaches of the normal weight range, you begin to see increases in chronic diseases,”  said  JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, HMS Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health, and HSPH professor of epidemiology. “It’s a clear gradient of increase.”
 
Yeah, she  would  say that.
 
Thin people.
 
And then there’s Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at Harvard:
  
The studies that Flegal [the author of the original study finding a negative correlation between body mass index and mortality] did use included many samples of people who were chronically ill, current smokers and elderly, according to Hu. These factors are associated with weight loss and increased mortality.  In other words, people are not dying because they are slim, he said. They are slim because they are dying—of cancer or old age, for example. By doing a meta-analysis of studies that did not properly control for this bias, Flegal amplif</p><p>3 0.77102673 <a title="821-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-03-Google_Translate_for_code%2C_and_an_R_help-list_bot.html">1296 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-03-Google Translate for code, and an R help-list bot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What we did in our Stan meeting yesterday:
 
Some discussion of revision of the Nuts paper, some conversations about parameterizations of categorical-data models, plans for the R interface, blah blah blah.
 
But also, I had two exciting new ideas!
 
 Google Translate for code 
 
Wouldn’t it be great if Google Translate could work on computer languages?  I suggested this and somebody said that it might be a problem because code isn’t always translatable.  But that doesn’t worry so much.  Google Translate for human languages isn’t perfect either but it’s a useful guide.  If I want to write a message to someone in French or Spanish or Dutch, I wouldn’t just write it in English and run it through Translate.  What I do is try my best to write it in the desired language, but I can try out some tricky words or phrases in the translator.  Or, if I start by translating, I go back and forth to make sure it all makes sense.

<p>Introduction: From a commenter on the web, 21 May 2010:
  
Tampa Bay:  Playing .732 ball in the toughest division in baseball, wiped their feet on NY twice.  If they sweep Houston, which seems pretty likely, they will be at .750, which I [the commenter] have never heard of. 
  
At the time of that posting, the Rays were 30-11.  Quick calculation:  if a team is good enough to be expected to win 100 games, that is, Pr(win) = 100/162 = .617, then there’s a 5% chance that they’ll have won at least 30 of their first 41 games.  That’s a calculation based on simple probability theory of independent events, which isn’t quite right here but will get you close and is a good way to  train one’s intuition , I think.
 
Having a .732 record after 41 games is not unheard-of.  The Detroit Tigers won 35 of their first 40 games in 1984:  that’s .875.  (I happen to remember that fast start, having been an Orioles fan at the time.) 
 
 Now on to the key ideas

<p>Introduction: I had an email exchange with Patrick Steigler the other day that amused me, so I’ll share it with you.
 
Steigler started with the subject line “Taleb and STDEV vs. MAD” and the message:  I came across http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25401 and was wondering what your thoughts on the issue might be. 
 
My reply:  How come they never ask me for my opinions in these surveys?
 
Steigler:  Maybe you need to write a book of aphorisms.
 
me:  There’s this:

and then this, which some students collected from a course I taught:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/gelman_quotes.pdf
 
Steigler:  So, what would you opinion be on the scientific idea that is ready for retirement?
 
me:  I guess it’s a good thing they didn’t ask me!
 
Steigler:  How about the retirement of p value < .05 for significance?
 
me:  Yeah, but that’s too easy.  It’s like if someone asks for a pop music recommendation and you say The Beatles.

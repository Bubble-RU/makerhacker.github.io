[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.  Sure, traffic congestion is annoying, but there must be some advantages to driving on that crowded road or pe</p><p>6 0.11763766 <a title="752-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-More_data_tools_worth_using_from_Google.html">911 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-More data tools worth using from Google</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Frank Wood and Nick Bartlett  write :
  
Deplump works the same as all probabilistic lossless compressors. A datastream is fed one observation at a time into a predictor which emits both the data stream and predictions about what the next observation in the stream should be for every observation. An encoder takes this output and produces a compressed stream which can be piped over a network or to a file. A receiver then takes this stream and decompresses it by doing everything in reverse. In order to ensure that the decoder has the same information available to it that the encoder had when compressing the stream, the decoded datastream is both emitted and directed to another predictor. This second predictor’s job is to produce exactly the same predictions as the initial predictor so that the decoder has the same information at every step of the process as the encoder did.


The difference between probabilistic lossless compressors is in the prediction engine, encoding and decoding bein</p><p>3 0.72315776 <a title="752-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-Google_Refine.html">910 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-Google Refine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tools worth knowing about: 
  
  Google Refine  is a power tool for working with messy data, cleaning it up, transforming it from one format into another, extending it with web services, and linking it to databases like Freebase.
  
A recent  discussion on the Polmeth list  about the  ANES Cumulative File  is a setting where I think Refine might help (admittedly 49760×951 is bigger than I’d really like to deal with in the browser with js… but on a subset yes). [I might write this example up later.]
 
Go watch the screencast videos for Refine. Data-entry problems are rampant in stuff we all use — leading or trailing spaces; mixed decimal-indicators; different units or transformations used in the same column; mixed lettercase leading to false duplicates; that’s only the beginning. Refine certainly would help find duplicates, and it counts things for you too. Just counting rows is too much for researchers sometimes (see  yesterday’s post )!

<p>Introduction: StackOverflow  has been a  popular community where software developers would help one another. Recently they  raised some VC funding , and to make profits they are selling job postings and expanding the model to other areas.  Metaoptimize LLC  has started a similar website, using the open-source  OSQA framework  for such as statistics and machine learning. Here’s a description:
  

You and other data geeks can ask and answer questions on machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, text analysis, information retrieval, search, data mining, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
   

Here you can ask and answer questions, comment and vote for the questions of others and their answers. Both questions and answers can be revised and improved. Questions can be tagged with the relevant keywords to simplify future access and organize the accumulated material.

<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.

Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>4 0.87742138 <a title="752-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-More_by_Berger_and_me_on_weakly_informative_priors.html">1092 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-More by Berger and me on weakly informative priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  by Alex Tabarrok (following up on an article by Rebecca Solnit) on the continuum between voluntarism (or, more generally, non-cash transactions) and markets with monetary exchange.  I just have a few comments of my own:
 
1.  Solnit writes of “the iceberg economy,” which she characterizes as “based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return . . . the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit.”  I just wonder whether “barter” completely fits in here.  Maybe it depends on context.  Sometimes barter is an informal way of keeping track (you help me and I help you), but in settings of low liquidity I could imagine barter being simply an inefficient way of performing an economic transaction.
 
2.  I am no expert on capitalism but my impression is that it’s not just about “competition and selfishness” but also is related to the</p><p>6 0.87568283 <a title="752-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-01-Mothers_and_Moms.html">1479 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-01-Mothers and Moms</a></p>

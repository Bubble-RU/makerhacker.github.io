<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts writes:
  
The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>4 0.23303322 <a title="719-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-03-Objects_of_the_class_%E2%80%9CLawrence_Summers%E2%80%9D%3A__Arne_Duncan_edition.html">2122 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-03-Objects of the class “Lawrence Summers”:  Arne Duncan edition</a></p>

Here’s what happened.  I came across a thoughtful  discussion  by Mark Palko of how it was that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ticked off so many people with his recent remarks about “white suburban moms”:
  
To understand why Duncan hit such a nerve, you need to consider the long and complicated role that racial politics have played in this debate.


The public face of the education reform movement has always been pictures of eager young African-American and Hispanic children. Not only has the movement been sold as a way of helping these children but people who object to parts of the reform agenda have often been accused, implicitly or explicitly, of not wanting to help children of color. . . . For starters, with certain notable exceptions, the leaders of the reform movement tend to be white or Asian . . .

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>6 0.18825614 <a title="719-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In response to my most recent  post  expressing bafflement over the Erving Goffman mystique, several commenters helped out by suggesting classic Goffman articles for me to read.  Naturally, I followed the  reference  that had a link attached–it was for an article called Cooling the Mark Out, which analogized the frustrations of laid-off and set-aside white-collar workers to the reactions to suckers after being bilked by con artists.
 
Goffman’s article was fascinating, but I was bothered by a tone of smugness. Here’s a quote from Cooling the Mark Out that starts on the cute side but is basically ok:
  
In organizations patterned after a bureaucratic model, it is customary for personnel to expect rewards of a specified kind upon fulfilling requirements of a specified nature.

Is it fair to quote the definition of economics from the blurb for a book?  If so, consider this definition in the blurb for Emily Oster’s new book:

 
When Oster was expecting her first child, she felt powerless to make the right decisions for her pregnancy. How doctors think and what patients need are two very different things. So Oster drew on her own experience and went in search of the real facts about pregnancy using an economist’s tools. Economics is not just a study of finance. It’s the science of determining value and making informed decisions. To make a good decision, you need to understand the information available to you and to know what it means to you as an individual.
 

So, when applied to a medical topic (like pregnancy) how does this differ from evidence based medicine?  Should I be calling myself an economist? 


None of this mean that Emily shouldn’t write this book. My own read on the alcohol and pregnancy angle is that the current advic</p><p>5 0.84302479 <a title="719-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-14-I_hate_to_get_all_Gerd_Gigerenzer_on_you_here%2C_but_._._..html">1319 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-14-I hate to get all Gerd Gigerenzer on you here, but . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor points me to an  opinion piece  by psychologist Reid Hastie, “Our Gift for Good Stories Blinds Us to the Truth.”
 
I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.  That could be fine—after all, Hastie is a distinguished psychology researcher—but I wasn’t so clear that he’s so clear on what he’s saying.  For example:
  
The human brain is designed to support two modes of thought: visual and narrative. These forms of thinking are universal across human societies throughout history, develop reliably early in individuals’ lives</p><p>6 0.83734328 <a title="719-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-10-The_recursion_of_pop-econ.html">1850 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-10-The recursion of pop-econ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When linking to my  review  of Duncan Watts’s book in a recent post, I came across some fun bits that I’d like to share (for those of you who didn’t just click through and read the whole thing):
 
On business books:
  
I’m not so interested in the business angle but I suppose that’s how you sell books these days. The business part of the book was ok—I’m not saying it was filler—it’s just that I’m not particularly interested in which format of videocassette wins, or whether Cisco Systems is a well-run company. I realize that a lot of people care about this sort of things nowadays, but I’d rather talk about sports or politics.
  
On dodgy science writer John Gribbin:
  
Sure, people write all sorts of silly things but usually they have some sort of political or religious excuse for why it’s ok to believe them. Truth is not the only important value in life, there are also other concerns such as political convictions, religious beliefs, and the simple desire to avoid offending people. Thus</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97291791 <a title="719-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-19-Everything_is_Obvious_%28once_you_know_the_answer%29.html">719 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-19-Everything is Obvious (once you know the answer)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.  When learning science, we sometimes speak</p><p>3 0.96752626 <a title="719-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Statistician_cracks_Toronto_lottery.html">562 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Statistician cracks Toronto lottery</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian points me to  this  amusing story by Jonah Lehrer about Mohan Srivastava, (perhaps the same person as R. Mohan Srivastava, coauthor of a book called Applied Geostatistics) who discovered a flaw in a scratch-off game in which he could figure out which tickets were likely to win based on partial information visible on the ticket.  It appears that scratch-off lotteries elsewhere have similar flaws in their design.
 
The obvious question is, why doesn’t the lottery create the patterns on the tickets (including which “teaser” numbers to reveal) completely at random?  It shouldn’t be hard to design this so that zero information is supplied from the outside. in which case Srivastava’s trick would be impossible.
 
So why not put down the numbers randomly?  Lehrer quotes Srivastava as saying:
  
The tickets are clearly mass-produced, which means there must be some computer program that lays down the numbers. Of course, it would be really nice if the computer could just spit out random</p><p>4 0.9658494 <a title="719-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>5 0.96576786 <a title="719-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-05-More_philosophy_of_Bayes.html">1247 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-05-More philosophy of Bayes</a></p>

 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables).

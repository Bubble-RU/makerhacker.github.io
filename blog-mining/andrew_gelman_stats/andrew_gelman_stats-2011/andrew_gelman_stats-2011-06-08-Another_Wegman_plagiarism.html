</p><p>17 - They couldn’t just quote the relevant sections, because they had the “wrong” answers, and anyone who actually reads Ray’s book knows that it is mostly about the techniques for extracting signal from noise and coping with the various confounders. [sent-42, score-0.183]
</p><p>18 - They couldn’t quote some sections and then change the conclusions without being totally obvious. [sent-43, score-0.262]

<p>Introduction: A common reason for plagiarism is laziness:  you want credit for doing something but you don’t really feel like doing it–maybe you’d rather go fishing, or bowling, or blogging, or whatever, so you just steal it, or you hire someone to steal it for you.
 
Interestingly enough, we see that in many  defenses  of plagiarism allegations.  A common response is:  I was sloppy in dealing with my notes, or I let my research assistant (who, incidentally, wasn’t credited in the final version) copy things for me and the research assistant got sloppy.  The common theme:  The person wanted the credit without doing the work.
 
As I  wrote  last year, I like to think that directness and openness is a virtue in scientific writing. For example, clearly citing the works we draw from, even when such citing of secondary sources might make us appear less erudite. But I can see how some scholars might feel a pressure to cover their traces.

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>4 0.3131206 <a title="751-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-Last_Wegman_post_%28for_now%29.html">766 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-Last Wegman post (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mashey points me to a  news article  by Eli Kintisch with the following wonderful quote:
  
Will Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who questions the consensus view on climate, thinks Mashey is a destructive force who uses “totalitarian tactics”–publishing damaging documents online, without peer review–to carry out personal vendettas.
  
I’ve never thought of uploading files as “totalitarian” but maybe they do things differently at Princeton.  I actually think of totalitarians as acting secretly–denunciations without evidence, midnight arrests, trials in undisclosed locations, and so forth.  Mashey’s practice of putting everything out in the open seems to me the opposite of totalitarian.
 
The article also reports that Edward Wegman’s lawyer said that Wegman “has never engaged in plagiarism.”  If I were the lawyer, I’d be pretty mad at Wegman at this point.  I can just imagine the conversation:
 
Lawyer:  You never told me about  that 2005 paper  where you stole from Bria</p><p>5 0.23867853 <a title="751-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: A colleague asks:
  
When I search the web, I find  the story  [of the article by Said, Wegman, et al. on social networks in climate research, which was recently bumped from the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis because of plagiarism] only on blogs, USA Today, and UPI.  Why is that?  Any idea why it isn’t reported by any of the major newspapers?
  
Here’s my answer:
 
1.  USA Today broke the story.  Apparently this USA Today reporter put a lot of effort into it.  The NYT doesn’t like to run a story that begins, “Yesterday, USA Today reported…”
 
2.  To us it’s big news because we’re statisticians.  [The main guy in the study, Edward Wegman, won the Founders Award from the American Statistical Association a few years ago.]  To the rest of the world, the story is:  “Obscure prof at an obscure college plagiarized an article in a journal that nobody’s ever heard of.”  When a Harvard scientist paints black dots on white mice and says he’s curing cancer, that’s news.

<p>Introduction: This entry was posted by Phil Price. 
 
	A colleague is looking at data on car (and SUV and light truck) collisions and casualties.  He’s interested in causal relationships.  For instance, suppose car manufacturers try to improve gas mileage without decreasing acceleration.  The most likely way they will do that is to make cars lighter.  But perhaps lighter cars are more dangerous; how many more people will die for each mpg increase in gas mileage?
 
	There are a few different data sources, all of them seriously deficient from the standpoint of answering this question.  Deaths are very well reported, so if someone dies in an auto accident you can find out what kind of car they were in, what other kinds of cars (if any) were involved in the accident, whether the person was a driver or passenger, and so on.  But it’s hard to normalize:  OK, I know that N people who were passengers in a particular model of car died in car accidents last year, but I don’t know how many passenger-miles that</p><p>2 0.9681142 <a title="751-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-31-Editing_and_clutch_hitting.html">173 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-31-Editing and clutch hitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Regarding  editing :  The only serious editing I’ve ever received has been for my New York Times op-eds and my article in the American Scientist.  My book editors have all been nice people, and they’ve helped me with many things (including suggestions of what my priorities should be in communicating with readers)–they’ve been great–but they’ve not given (nor have I expected or asked for) serious editing.  Maybe I should’ve asked for it, I don’t know.  I’ve had time-wasting experiences with copy editors and a particularly annoying experience with a production editor (who was so difficult that my coauthors and I actually contacted our agent and a lawyer about the possibility of getting out of our contract), but that’s another story.
 
Regarding  clutch hitting , Bill James once noted that it’s great when a Bucky Dent hits an unexpected home run, but what’s really special is being able to get the big hit when it’s expected of you.

<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:
  
Participants in the Health Prize challenge will be given a data set comprised of the de-identified medical records of 100,000 individuals who are members of HPN.  The teams will then need to predict the hospitalization of a set percentage of those members who went to the hospital during the year following the start date, and do so with a defined accuracy rate.  The winners will receive the $3 million prize. . . . the contest is designed to spur involvement by others involved in analytics, such as those involved in data mining and predictive modeling who may not currently be working in health care.  “We believe that doing so will bring innovative thinking to health analytics and may allow us to solve at</p><p>4 0.96466339 <a title="751-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-08-%E2%80%9CWhat_do_you_think_about_curved_lines_connecting_discrete_data-points%3F%E2%80%9D.html">134 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-08-“What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

<p>Introduction: In politics, as in baseball, hot prospects from the minors can have trouble handling big-league pitching.
  

 
Right after Sarah Palin was chosen as the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, my friend Ubs, who grew up in Alaska and follows politics closely, wrote  the following :
  
Palin would probably be a pretty good president. . . . She is fantastically popular. Her percentage approval ratings have reached the 90s. Even now, with a minor nepotism scandal going on, she’s still about 80%. . . . How does one do that? You might get 60% or 70% who are rabidly enthusiastic in their love and support, but you’re also going to get a solid core of opposition who hate you with nearly as much passion. The way you get to 90% is by being boringly competent while remaining inoffensive to people all across the political spectrum.
  
Ubs gives a long discussion of Alaska’s unique politics and then writes:

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor points me to an  opinion piece  by psychologist Reid Hastie, “Our Gift for Good Stories Blinds Us to the Truth.”
 
I have mixed feelings about Hastie’s article.  On one hand I do think his point is important.  It’s not new to me, but presumably it’s new to many readers of bloomberg.com.  I like Hastie’s book (with Robyn Dawes), Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, and I’m predisposed to like anything new that he writes.
 
On the other hand, there’s something about Hastie’s article that bothered me.  It seemed a bit smug, as if he thinks he understands the world and wants to just explain it to the rest of us.  That could be fine—after all, Hastie is a distinguished psychology researcher—but I wasn’t so clear that he’s so clear on what he’s saying.  For example:
  
The human brain is designed to support two modes of thought: visual and narrative. These forms of thinking are universal across human societies throughout history, develop reliably early in individuals’ lives</p><p>3 0.092430949 <a title="628-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-22-Battle_of_the_Repo_Man_quotes%3A__Reid_Hastie%E2%80%99s_turn.html">1336 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-22-Battle of the Repo Man quotes:  Reid Hastie’s turn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In response to my comments on his recent opinion article on the the human tendency to overvalue information presented as stories, Reid Hastie  writes :
  
Andrew (and Commenters) … I’d like to try to clarify some of the statements and implications in my Bloomberg article on “Our Gift for Good Stories …”  The essay is what it is, but some of the implications that I intended to convey do not seem to have been communicated effectively.  So, let me take a shot at clarification here.  (Of course I am not assuming that, once clarified, my statements are necessarily correct or that you will agree with them.)


1.  What I meant in the sections of the paper that claimed the brain is naturally good at visual and causal (narrative) thinking, is that that the brain was probably selected, through evolutionary processes to be adaptively successful at those capacities.  I don’t have good evidence for this claim … but, we do a lot of those kinds of thinking, we’re distinctive as a species in the ways</p><p>4 0.075873859 <a title="628-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians%3A_When_We_Teach%2C_We_Don%E2%80%99t_Practice_What_We_Preach.html">1237 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians: When We Teach, We Don’t Practice What We Preach</a></p>

Severe Weather and Automobile Assembly Productivity


Gérard P. Cachon, Santiago Gallino and Marcelo Olivares


Abstract: It is expected that climate change could lead to an increased frequency of severe weather. In turn, severe weather intuitively should hamper the productivity of work that occurs outside. But what is the effect of rain, snow, fog, heat and wind on work that occurs indoors, such as the production of automobiles? Using weekly production data from 64 automobile plants in the United States over a ten-year period, we ﬁnd that adverse weather conditions lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in production. For example, one additional day of high wind advisory by the National Weather Service (i.e., maximum winds generally in excess of 44 miles per hour) reduces production by 26%, which is comparable in order of magnitude t</p><p>6 0.064398743 <a title="628-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-02-Not_so_fast_on_levees_and_seawalls_for_NY_harbor%3F.html">1558 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-02-Not so fast on levees and seawalls for NY harbor?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It was reported  last year  that the national lottery of Israel featured the exact same 6 numbers (out of 45) twice in the same month, and statistics professor Isaac Meilijson of Tel Aviv University was quoted as saying that “the incident of six numbers repeating themselves within a month is an event of once in 10,000 years.”
 
I shouldn’t mock when it comes to mathematics–after all, I proved a false theorem once!  (Or, to be precise, my collaborator and I published a false claim which we thought we’d proved, thus we thought was a theorem.)
 
So let me retract the mockery and move, first to the mathematics and then to the statistics.
  

 
First, how many possibilities are there in pick 6 out of 45?  It’s (45*44*43*42*41*40)/6! = 8,145,060.  Let’s call this number N.
 
Second, what’s the probability that the same numbers repeat in a single calendar month?  I’ve been told that the Israeli lottery has 2 draws per week,  That’s 104/12=8.67 draws per month.  Or maybe they skip some holiday</p><p>3 0.60292792 <a title="628-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-26-Luck_or_knowledge%3F.html">873 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-26-Luck or knowledge?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).

<p>Introduction: The other day we had a fun little discussion in  the comments section of the sister blog  about the appropriateness of stating forecast probabilities to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.
 
It started when Josh Tucker posted this graph from  Nate Silver :
 
   
 
My first reaction was:  this looks pretty but it’s hyper-precise.  I’m a big fan of Nate’s work, but all those little wiggles on the graph can’t really mean anything.  And what could it possibly mean to compute this probability to that level of precision?
 
In the comments, people came at me from two directions.  From one side, Jeffrey Friedman  expressed  a hard core attitude that it’s meaningless to give a probability forecast of a unique event:
  
What could it possibly mean, period, given that this election will never be repeated? . . . I know there’s a vast literature on this, but I’m still curious, as a non-statistician, what it could mean for there to be a meaningful 65% probability (as opposed to a non-quantifiab</p><p>6 0.56451225 <a title="628-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-%E2%80%9CRoughly_90%25_of_the_increase_in_._._.%E2%80%9D__Hey%2C_wait_a_minute%21.html">549 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-“Roughly 90% of the increase in . . .”  Hey, wait a minute!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: According to the  National Weather Service :
  
What is a 100 year flood?  A 100 year flood is an event that statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. A 500 year flood has a .2% chance of occurring and a 1000 year flood has a .1% chance of occurring.
  
The accompanying map shows a part of Tennessee that in May 2010 had 1000-year levels of flooding.
 
 
 
At first, it seems hard to believe that a 1000-year flood would have just happened to occur last year.  But then, this is just a 1000-year flood for that particular place.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t really have a sense of the statistics of these events.  How many 100-year, 500-year, and 1000-year flood events have been recorded by the Weather Service, and when have they occurred?</p><p>2 0.91768289 <a title="628-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-11-Calibration_in_chess.html">568 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-11-Calibration in chess</a></p>

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

How far off is bglmer and can it handle ordered logit or multinom logit?
  
My reply:
 
bglmer is very close.  No ordered logit but I was just talking about it with Sophia today.  My guess is that the easiest way to fit a hierarchical ordered logit or multinom logit will be to use stan.  For right now I’d recommend using glmer/bglmer to fit the ordered logits in order (e.g., 1 vs. 2,3,4, then 2 vs. 3,4, then 3 vs. 4).  Or maybe there’s already a hierarchical multinomial logit in mcmcpack or somewhere?</p><p>5 0.83946073 <a title="628-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Felix_Salmon_wins_the_American_Statistical_Association%E2%80%99s_Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">33 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Felix Salmon wins the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The official announcement:
  
The Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award for 2010 is presented to Felix Salmon for his body of work, which exemplifies the highest standards of scientific reporting. His insightful use of statistics as a tool to understanding the world of business and economics, areas that are critical in today’s economy, sets a new standard in statistical investigative reporting.
  
Here are some examples:
 
 Tiger Woods 
 
 Nigerian spammers 
 
 How the government fudges job statistics 
 
This one is important to me.  The idea is that “statistical reporting” is not just traditional science reporting (journalist talks with scientists and tries to understand the consensus) or science popularization or silly feature stories about the lottery.  Salmon is doing investigative reporting using statistical thinking.
 
Also, from a political angle, Salmon’s smart and quantitatively sophisticated work (as well as that of others such as Nate Silver) is an important counterweigh</p><p>6 0.83715814 <a title="628-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-04-High-level_intellectual_discussions_in_the_Columbia_statistics_department.html">745 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-04-High-level intellectual discussions in the Columbia statistics department</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The title of  this post  by Sanjay Srivastava illustrates an annoying misconception that’s crept into the (otherwise delightful) recent  publicity  related to my  article  with Hal Stern, he difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant.
 
When people bring this up, they keep referring to the difference between p=0.05 and p=0.06, making the familiar (and correct) point about the arbitrariness of the conventional p-value threshold of 0.05.  And, sure, I agree with this, but everybody knows that already.
 
The point Hal and I were making was that even apparently large differences in p-values are not statistically significant. For example, if you have one study with z=2.5 (almost significant at the 1% level!) and another with z=1 (not statistically significant at all, only 1 se from zero!), then their difference has a z of about 1 (again, not statistically significant at all). So it’s not just a comparison of 0.05 vs. 0.06, even a differenc</p><p>3 0.17838424 <a title="920-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk_update.html">497 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Florence from customer support at  Hipmunk  writes:
  
Hipmunk now includes American Airlines in our search results. Please note that users will be taken directly to AA.com to complete the booking/transaction. . . . we are steadily increasing the number of flights that we offer on Hipmunk.
  
As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.  The regular Amtrak website is about as horrible as you’d expect.</p><p>4 0.1620357 <a title="920-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk_worked.html">2238 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk worked</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past I’ve categorized Hipmunk as  a really cool flight-finder that doesn’t actually work , as  worse than Expedia , and as  graphics without content .
 
So, I thought it would be only fair to tell you that I bought a flight the other day using Hipmunk and it gave me the same flight as Expedia but at a lower cost (by linking to something called CheapOair, which I hope is legit).

<p>Introduction: There was some confusion on  my last try , so let me explain one more time . . . 
   
The flights I where Hipmunk failed (see  here  for background) were not obscure itineraries. One of them was a nonstop from New York to Cincinnati; another was from NY to Durham, North Carolina; and yet another was a trip to Midway in Chicago. In that last case, Hipmunk showed no nonstops at all—which will come as a surprise to the passengers on the Southwest Airlines flight I was on a couple days ago! In these cases, Hipmunk didn’t even do the courtesy of flashing a message telling me to try elsewhere.
 
I don’t understand. How hard would it be for the program to automatically do a Kayak search and find all the flights?
 
Hipmunk’s graphics are great, though. Lee Wilkinson reports:

<p>Introduction: Brendan pointed me to  this  news article by David Pogue promoting a website called  Hipmunk , a sleek competitor to Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, and the like.
 
Coincidentally, I had to a buy a flight  right now  so I followed the link and found that, indeed, Hipmunk is about a zillion times easier to use and more impressive than Expedia or even Kayak.  It’s awesome.  The others aren’t even close.  The display was so clean and effective, I felt like ordering a few flights just for fun.
 
That’s the good news.  Now the bad news.  I wasn’t just playing around with the site.  There was actually a flight I wanted to buy–an itinerary I’d looked into yesterday but hadn’t saved or booked.  I effortlessly set up the request in Hipmunk, scanned its impressive graphical display, and . . . couldn’t find the flight I wanted!  Oh no!  The last ticket must’ve been sold!
 
Just to check, though, I want on good old ugly Expedia.  And my flight was right there!  So I bought it.
 
So, just a quick memo</p><p>3 0.63470101 <a title="920-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-20-Last_post_on_Hipmunk.html">917 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-20-Last post on Hipmunk</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about this because we seem to be circling around the same few topics over and over (while occasionally slipping in some new statistical ideas): 
   
10. Wegman 
9. Hipmunk 
8. Dennis the dentist 
7. Freakonomics 
6. The difference between significant and non-significant is not itself statistically significant 
5. Just use a hierarchical model already! 
4. Innumerate journalists who think that presidential elections are just like high school 
3. A graph can be pretty but convey essentially no information 
2. Stan is coming 
1. Clippy!

<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.  I can’t believe anyone has such a precise estimate of the health effects of pesticides, and also I can’t believe anyone has such a precise effect of the health effect of eating an app</p><p>3 0.88581753 <a title="920-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-29-Unfinished_business.html">637 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-29-Unfinished business</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  blog  by J. Robert Lennon on abandoned novels made me think of the more general topic of abandoned projects.  I seem to recall George V. Higgins writing that he’d written and discarded 14 novels or so before publishing The Friends of Eddie Coyle.
 
I haven’t abandoned any novels but I’ve abandoned lots of research projects (and also have started various projects that there’s no way I’ll finish).  If you think about the decisions involved, it really has to be that way. You learn while you’re working on a project whether it’s worth continuing.  Sometimes I’ve put in the hard work and pushed a project to completion, published the article, and then I think . . . what was the point?  The modal number of citations of our articles is zero, etc.</p><p>4 0.88083065 <a title="920-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-19-Google%E2%80%99s_word_count_statistics_viewer.html">476 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-19-Google’s word count statistics viewer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In response to the post  The bane of many causes  in the context of mobile phone use and brain cancer,  Robert Erikson  wrote:
  

The true control here is the side of the head of the tumor: same side as phone use or opposite side.   If that is the test, the data from the study are scary.  Clearly tumors are more likely on the “same” side, at whatever astronomical p value you want to use.   That cannot be explained away by misremembering, since an auxiliary study showed misremembering was not biased toward cell phone-tumor consistency.

  
A strong signal in the data pointed by Prof. Erikson is that the tumors are overwhelmingly likelier to appear on the same side of the head as where the phone is held. I’ve converted the ratios into percentages, based on an assumption that the risk for tumors would be apriori equal for both sides of the head.
 
 
 
There is a group of people with low-to-moderate exposure and high lateral bias, but the bias does increase quite smoothly with increasing</p><p>6 0.84083545 <a title="920-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Stan_1.2.0_and_RStan_1.2.0.html">1753 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Stan 1.2.0 and RStan 1.2.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Will Wilkinson  adds  to the discussion of Jonathan Haidt’s  remarks  regarding the overwhelming prevalance of liberal or left-wing attitudes among psychology professors.  I pretty much agree with Wilkinson’s overview:
  
Folks who constantly agree with one another grow insular, self-congratulatory, and not a little lazy. The very possibility of disagreement starts to seem weird or crazy. When you’re trying to do science about human beings, this attitude’s not so great.
  
Wilkinson also reviewed the work of  John Jost  in this area.  Jost is a psychology researcher with the expected liberal/left political leanings, but his relevance here is that he has actually done research on political attitudes and personality types.  In Wilkinson’s words:
  
Jost has done plenty of great work that helps explain not only why the best minds in science are liberal, but why most scientists-most academics, even-are liberal.

<p>Introduction: John Cook  writes  that he’d like to hear more people talk about “educational monoculture.”  I don’t actually know John Cook but I enjoy reading his blog, so I feel like the least I can do is to honor his request.
 
I have to admit that I have a bit of a monocultural temperament myself.  I have strong feelings about the right and wrong way to do things, and I don’t have much patience for what seems to me to be the wrong way.  As a result, I’ve often disparaged or ignored important statistical developments because some small aspect of the new idea didn’t fit with my thinking.  (On the plus side, I think I’ve disparaged or ignored lots more bad ideas thad deserve oblivion.)
 
I’ve always been suspicious of the hedgehog/fox distinction because my impression is that just about everybody likes to think of him or herself as a fox.  Being a hedgehog is like being “ideological”; most of us like to think of ourselves as pragmatic foxes.  And in any case I think  most statisticians  are foxes.</p><p>4 0.15312512 <a title="638-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-28-Economists_argue_about_Bayes.html">1695 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-28-Economists argue about Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: Radford  writes :
  
The word “conservative” gets used many ways, for various political purposes, but I would take it’s basic meaning to be someone who thinks there’s a lot of wisdom in traditional ways of doing things, even if we don’t understand exactly why those ways are good, so we should be reluctant to change unless we have a strong argument that some other way is better. This sounds very Bayesian, with a prior reducing the impact of new data.
  
I agree completely, and I think Radford will very much enjoy  my article with Aleks Jakulin , “Bayes: radical, liberal, or conservative?”  Radford’s comment also fits with my increasing inclination to use informative prior distributions.</p><p>6 0.13564689 <a title="638-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-21-The_future_%28and_past%29_of_statistical_sciences.html">2072 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-21-The future (and past) of statistical sciences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was trying to explain in class how a (Bayesian) statistician reads the formula for a probability distribution.  In old-fashioned statistics textbooks you’re told that if you want to compute a conditional distribution from a joint distribution you need to do some heavy math:  p(a|b) = p(a,b)/\int p(a’,b)da’.
 
When doing Bayesian statistics, though, you usually don’t have to do the integration or the division. If you have parameters theta and data y, you first write p(y,theta).  Then to get p(theta|y), you  don’t  need to integrate or divide.  All you have to do is look at p(y,theta) in a certain way:  Treat y as a constant and theta as a variable.  Similarly, if you’re doing the Gibbs sampler and want a conditional distribution, just consider the parameter you’re updating as the variable and everything else as a constant.  No need to integrate or divide, you just take the joint distribution and look at it from the right perspective.

<p>Introduction: In connection with  this  workshop, I was asked to write a few paragraphs describing my perspective on “the current and near-term future state of the statistical sciences you are most familiar with.”  Here’s what I wrote:
  
I think that, at any given time, the field of statistics has a core, but that core changes over time.  There are different paradigmatic ways to solve problems.


100 or 150 years ago, the thing to do was to identify a phenomenon of interest with some probability distribution and then use the mathematics of that distribution to gain insight into the underlying process.  Thus, for example, if certain data looked like they came from a normal distribution, one could surmise that the values in question arose by adding many small independent pieces.  If the data looked like they came from a binomial distribution, that would imply independence and equal probabilities.

<p>Introduction: This is a chance for me to combine two of my interests–politics and statistics–and probably to irritate both halves of the readership of this blog.  Anyway…
 
I recently  wrote  about the apparent correlation between Bayes/non-Bayes statistical ideology and liberal/conservative political ideology:
  
The Bayes/non-Bayes fissure had a bit of a political dimension–with anti-Bayesians being the old-line conservatives (for example, Ronald Fisher) and Bayesians having a more of a left-wing flavor (for example, Dennis Lindley). Lots of counterexamples at an individual level, but my impression is that on average the old curmudgeonly, get-off-my-lawn types were (with some notable exceptions) more likely to be anti-Bayesian.
  
This was somewhat based on my experiences at Berkeley.  Actually, some of the cranky anti-Bayesians were probably Democrats as well, but when they were being anti-Bayesian they seemed pretty conservative.

<p>Introduction: In a link to our  back-and-forth  on causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings, Elias Bareinboim (a computer scientist who is working with Judea Pearl)  writes :
  
In the past week, I have been engaged in a discussion with Andrew Gelman and his blog readers regarding causal inference, selection bias, confounding, and generalizability. I was trying to understand how his method which he calls “hierarchical modeling” would handle these issues and what guarantees it provides. . . . If anyone understands how “hierarchical modeling” can solve a simple toy problem (e.g., M-bias, control of confounding, mediation, generalizability), please share with us.
  
In his post, Bareinboim raises a direct question about hierarchical modeling and also indirectly brings up larger questions about what is convincing evidence when evaluating a statistical method.

<p>Introduction: A colleague recently sent me a copy of some articles on the estimation of treatment interactions (a topic that’s interested me for awhile).  One of the articles, which appeared in the Lancet in 2000, was called “ Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials ,” by Susan F. Assmann, Stuart J. Pocock, Laura E. Enos, and Linda E. Kasten. . . . 
 
Hey, wait a minute–I know Susan Assmann!  Well, I sort of know her.  When I was a freshman in college, I asked my adviser, who was an applied math prof, if I could do some research.  He connected me to Susan, who was one of his Ph.D. students, and she gave me a tiny part of her thesis to work on.
 
The problem went as follows.  You have a function f(x), for x going from 0 to infinity, that is defined as follows.  Between 0 and 1, f(x)=x.  Then, for x higher than 1, f’(x) = f(x) – f(x-1).  The goal is to figure out what f(x) does.  I think I’m getting this right here, but I might be getting confused on some of the detai</p><p>4 0.99744618 <a title="638-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-27-Overfitting.html">1431 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-27-Overfitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Esteban writes:
  
In traditional machine learning and statistical learning techniques, you spend a lot of time selecting your input features, fiddling with model parameter values, etc., all of which leads to the problem of overfitting the data and producing overly optimistic estimates for how good the model really is. You can use techniques such as cross-validation and out-of-sample validation data to try to limit the damage, but they are imperfect solutions at best.


While Bayesian models have the great advantage of not forcing you to manually select among the various weights and input features, you still often end up trying different priors and model structures (especially with hierarchical models), before coming up with a “final” model. When applying Bayesian modeling to real world data sets, how does should you evaluate alternate priors and topologies for the model without falling into the same overfitting trap as you do with non-Bayesian models?

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>6 0.99710059 <a title="638-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-17-%E2%80%9Cthe_Tea_Party%E2%80%99s_ire%2C_directed_at_Democrats_and_Republicans_alike%E2%80%9D.html">521 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-17-“the Tea Party’s ire, directed at Democrats and Republicans alike”</a></p>

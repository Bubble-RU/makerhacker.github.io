Are you familiar with Miller and Chapman’s (2001)  article : Misunderstanding Analysis of Covariance saying that ANCOVA (and therefore, I suppose regression) should not be used when groups differ on a covariate.    It has caused a moderate splash in psychology circles.  I wondered if you had any thoughts on it.
  
I had not heard of the article so I followed the link . . . ugh!  Already on the very first column of the very first page they confuse nonadditivity with nonlinearity.

<p>Introduction: I don’t know when I’ve seen political writing quote so misinformed as this. It’s a bizarre mixture of cliches, non-sequitors, and outright mistakes.
 
The author is Gregg Easterbrook and he’s writing for  Reuters .
 
First, the cliches:
  
Right now Romney seems to be the frontrunner, which, of course, is a mixed blessing. His aura of experience and reasonableness could prove quite appealing to voters. Perry continues to have the potential to light a populist fire. . . . Of all the 2012 candidates, Huntsman is the one who is Not Just Another Politician.
  
And now the errors.
  
At this point in the 1992 election cycle, the elder George Bush held an 89 percent approval rating. . . . Clinton beat a popular incumbent with a fantastic approval rating. For the 2012 election, Barack Obama is just as vulnerable as the elder Bush, if not even more so. Obama currently has an approval rating of 23 percent.
  
This is all fine, except that:

<p>Introduction: Dear Reuters editor:
 
Thanks for reading  my blog  and correcting the erroneous numbers in Easterbrook’s  column  from the other day.
 
I’m pretty sure you got the corrections from my blog because in your corrections you used  the exact same links  that I posted.  I think your readers will like that you gave links to the sources of your numbers.
 
But I’d appreciate if you cite me!  It’s considered polite to credit your sources rather than just copying over numbers and links with no mention of where they came from.  Unlike Easterbrook, I’m not expecting to be paid for this material but I’d still like to be thanked.
 
(See the last paragraph of  this post  by Felix Salmon for more on the desirability of linking to your sources.)
 
Also, since you’re correcting the article anyway, maybe you could go back and change this sentence too:
  
But don’t sell Huntsman short because he is low in the polls – Obama had been at that point, too.

<p>Introduction: Steve Miller writes: 
  
  
Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

<p>Introduction: Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute reports:
  
Goldman Sachs’ latest forecast (and they’ve been pretty accurate so far) is that unemployment will rise to 9.9% by early 2011 and trend down to 9.7% for the last quarter of 2011. Obviously, this is a simply awful scenario but it seems one that is being accepted. That is, we seem to be in the process of accepting the unacceptable. Note that this scenario probably assumes the passage of the limited efforts now being considered in Congress.
  
One might be surprised that Obama and congressional Democrats are not doing more to try to bring unemployment down.  On the other hand, just to speak in generalities (not knowing any of the people involved), I would think that Obama would be much much more worried about the economy doing well in 2010 and then crashing in 2012.  A crappy economy through 2011 and then improvement in 2012–that would be his ideal, no?  Not that he would have the ability to time this sort of thing.

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>4 0.74093819 <a title="885-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-14-The_most_clueless_political_column_ever%E2%80%94I_think_this_Easterbrook_dude_has_the_journalistic_equivalent_of_%E2%80%9Ctenure%E2%80%9D.html">959 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-14-The most clueless political column ever—I think this Easterbrook dude has the journalistic equivalent of “tenure”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had.

<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.
 
Here’s a quick graph; there’s more in the article:</p><p>3 0.89644277 <a title="885-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-28-Brow_inflation.html">489 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-28-Brow inflation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>4 0.89388323 <a title="885-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Boris_was_right.html">44 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Boris was right</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Writing in the Washington Post, Matt Miller  wants  a billionaire to run for president and “save the country.”
 
We already have two billionaires running for president.  (OK, not really.  Romney has a mere quarter of a billion bucks, and it’s Huntsman’s dad, not Huntsman himself, who’s the billionaire in that family.)  And, according to all reports, NYC mayor Bloomberg would run for president in an instant if he thought he’d have a chance of winning.
 
So we should amend Miller’s article to say that he wants a billionaire presidential candidate who (a) shares the political views of a “senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and co-host of public radio’s “Left, Right, and Center” and (b) has a chance of winning.  That shouldn’t be too hard to find, right?
 
Hey, I have an idea!  MIller writes that that Thomas Friedman just wrote a book arguing that “the right independent candidacy could provide for our dysfunctional politics presents an unrivaled opportunity.”  Friedman’s actu</p><p>6 0.85480368 <a title="885-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-05-Taking_philosophical_arguments_literally.html">17 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-05-Taking philosophical arguments literally</a></p>

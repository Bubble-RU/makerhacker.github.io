<p>Introduction: This guy (Michael Risch) actually  did a survey .  It seems like cheating to add actual systematic knowledge to the debate. . . .
 
What Iâ&euro;&trade;m wondering is, can I file a retroactive patent on the concept of albedo?

<p>Introduction: While visiting the education school at the University of Pennsylvania a couple months ago, I had a long conversation with Bob Boruch, a prominent researcher in the field of evidence-based education.  We shared  Fred Mosteller stories  and talked about a lot of other things too.
 
Boruch sent me an article about teaching randomized controlled trials to education students, which gave me the following idea which connects to my longstanding embarrassment (and subject of my next column on ethics, forthcoming in Chance magazine) about the lack of systematic measurement, sampling, or experimentation in our own teaching efforts.
 
Anyway, here’s my idea for experimentation in statistics teaching, an idea that I think could work particularly well in classes with education students.
 
Each class could, as part of the course, design an educational experiment to be performed on next year’s class.  Easier said than done, I know, but perhaps ed school students would be particularly motivated to do t</p><p>3 0.92889625 <a title="892-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-20-The_institution_of_tenure.html">2070 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-20-The institution of tenure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar writes:
  
The Priceonomics blog is doing a feature where we ask a few economists what they think of the the institution of tenure. If you’d be interested in participating, I’d love to get your response.


As an economist, what do you think of tenure? Should it be abolished / kept / modified?
  
My reply:  Just to be clear, I’m assuming that when you say “tenure,” you’re talking about lifetime employment for college professors such as myself.
 
I’m actually a political scientist, not an economist.  So rather than giving my opinion, I’ll say what I think an economist might say.
 
I think an economist could say one of two things:
 
Economist as anthropologist would say:  Tenure is decided by independent institutions acting freely.  If they choose to offer tenure, they will have good reasons, and it is not part of an economist’s job to second-guess individual decisions.
 
Economist as McKinsey consultant would say: Tenure can be evaluated based on a cost-benefit analysis.  How</p><p>4 0.92631054 <a title="892-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-10-On_deck_this_week.html">2206 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-10-On deck this week</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog has roughly a month’s worth of items waiting to be posted.  I post about once a day, sometimes rescheduling posts to make room for something topical.
 
Anyway, it struck me that I know what’s coming up, but  you  don’t.  So, here’s what we have for you during the next few days:
 
 Mon:   More on US health care overkill
 
 Tues:   My talks in Bristol this Wed and London this Thurs
 
 Wed:   How to think about “identifiability” in Bayesian inference?
 
 Thurs:   Stopping rules and Bayesian analysis
 
 Fri:   The popularity of certain baby names is falling off the clifffffffffffff
 
Plus anything our cobloggers might choose to post during these days.  And, if Woody Allen or Ed Wegman or anyone else newsworthy asks us to publish an op-ed for them, we’ll consider it.
 
Enjoy.</p><p>5 0.9253459 <a title="892-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-I_just_skyped_in_from_Kentucky%2C_and_boy_are_my_arms_tired.html">438 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-I just skyped in from Kentucky, and boy are my arms tired</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave my first Skype presentation today, and it felt pretty strange.
 
The technical difficulties mostly arose with the sound.  There were heavy echoes and so we ended up just cutting off the sound from the audience.  This made it more difficult for me because I couldn’t gauge audience reaction.  It was a real challenge to give a talk without being able to hear the laughter of the audience.  (I asked them to wave their hands every time they laughed, but they didn’t do so–or else they were never laughing, which would be even worse.)
 
Next time I’ll use the telephone for at least one of the sound channels.
 
The visuals were ok from my side–I just went thru my slides one by one, using the cursor to point to things.  I prefer standing next to the screen and pointing with my hands.  But doing it this way was ok, considering.
 
The real visual problem went the other way:  I couldn’t really see the audience.  From the perspective of the little computer camera, everyone seemed far away</p><p>6 0.92177886 <a title="892-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-17-G%2B_hangout_for_test_run_of_BDA_course.html">2066 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-17-G+ hangout for test run of BDA course</a></p>

<p>Introduction: People keep telling me that Sas isn’t as bad as everybody says, but then I see (from  Christian Robert ) this listing from the Sas website of “disadvantages in using Bayesian analysis”:
  
There is no correct way to choose a prior. Bayesian inferences require skills to translate prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior. If you do not proceed with caution, you can generate misleading results. . . . From a practical point of view, it might sometimes be difficult to convince subject matter experts who do not agree with the validity of the chosen prior.
  
That is so tacky! As if least squares, logistic regressions, Cox models, and all those other likelihoods mentioned in the Sas documentation are so automatically convincing to subject matter experts.

<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).
  
Echidne  quotes  a  news article  in which one of the study’s authors going overboard:

Larry Wasserman, “Low Assumptions, High Dimensions”:
 
This article was refreshing to me because it was so different from anything I’ve seen before.  Larry works in a statistics department and I work in a statistics department but there’s so little overlap in what we do.  Larry and I both work in high dimesions (maybe his dimensions are higher than mine, but a few thousand dimensions seems like a lot to me!), but there the similarity ends.  His article is all about using few to no assumptions, while I use assumptions all the time.  Here’s an example.  Larry writes:

I have been slowly working my way through the grad program in stats here, and the latest course was a biostats course on categorical and survival analysis.  I noticed in the semi-parametric  and parametric material (Wang and Lee is the text) that they use stepwise regression a lot.


I learned in econometrics that stepwise is poor practice, as it defaults to the “theory of the regression line”, that is no theory at all, just the variation in the data.


I don’t find the topic on your blog, and wonder if you have addressed the issue.
  
My reply:
 
Stepwise regression is one of these things, like outlier detection and pie charts, which appear to be popular among non-statisticans but are considered by statisticians to be a bit of a joke.  For example, Jennifer and I don’t mention stepwise regression in our book, not even once.

After seeing it cited, I just read  your paper  in Technometrics.  The home radon levels provide an interesting and instructive example.


I [Hoaglin] have a different take on the difficulty of interpreting the estimated coefficient of the county-level basement proportion (gamma-sub-2) on page 434.  An important part of the difficulty involves “other things being equal.”  That sounds like the widespread interpretation of a regression coefficient as telling how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor when the other predictors are held constant.  Unfortunately, as a general interpretation, that language is oversimplified; it doesn’t reflect how regression actually works.  The appropriate general interpretation is that the coefficient tells how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor after allowing for simultaneous change in the other predictors in the data at hand.

Regarding the book Mostly Harmless Econometrics, you  state :

 
A casual reader of the book might be left with the unfortunate impression that matching is a competitor to regression rather than a tool for making regression more effective.
 

But in fact isn’t that what they are arguing, that, in a  ‘mostly harmless way’ regression is in fact a matching estimator itself?


“Our view is that regression can be motivated as a particular sort of weighted matching estimator, and therefore the differences between regression and matching estimates are unlikely to be of major empirical importance” (Chapter 3 p. 70)


They seem to be distinguishing regression (without prior matching) from all other types of matching techniques, and therefore implying that regression can be a ‘mostly harmless’ substitute or competitor to matching. My previous understanding, before starting this book was as you say, that matching is a tool that makes regression more effective.

Just read  this  today and my unsophisticated statistical mind is confused.


“Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics.”


From my education about statistics, I remember to be suspicious about multiple regression coefficients that are in the opposite direction of the bivariate coefficients. What I am missing? I vaguely remember something about the suppression effect.
  
My reply:
 
There’s a long literature on this from many decades ago.  My general feeling about such situations is that, when the coefficient changes a lot after controlling for other variables, it is important to visualize this change, to understand what is the interaction among variables that is associated with the change in the coefficients.

<p>Introduction: Michael Betancourt  will be speaking at Google and at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Google talk is closed to outsiders (but if you work at Google, you should go!); the Berkeley talk is open to all:
  
Friday March 22, 12:10 pm, Evans Hall 1011.


Title of talk:  Stan : Practical Bayesian Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Abstract: Practical implementations of Bayesian inference are often limited to approximation methods that only slowly explore the posterior distribution.  By taking advantage of the curvature of the posterior, however, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) efficiently explores even the most highly contorted distributions.  In this talk I will review the foundations of and recent developments within HMC, concluding with a discussion of Stan, a powerful inference engine that utilizes HMC, automatic differentiation, and adaptive methods to minimize user input.

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>4 0.94301641 <a title="1094-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-How_to_think_about_Lou_Dobbs.html">335 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-How to think about Lou Dobbs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>5 0.91610146 <a title="1094-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-13-Randomized_experiments%2C_non-randomized_experiments%2C_and_observational_studies.html">340 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-13-Randomized experiments, non-randomized experiments, and observational studies</a></p>

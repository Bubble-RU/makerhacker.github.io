<p>Introduction: A group of University of California professors headed by physicist Richard Muller recently released a  report  confirming global warming.  Then geophysicist Judith Curry, a coauthor on the papers produced by the Muller group, turned around and  said  that their data actually show that global warming has stopped.

Curry is described in the news article as the second author on the papers, but the authors are listed alphabetically so it’s probably more accurate to describe her as one of the ten authors.  Muller’s one, Curry’s another, . . . now I want to know what 7 of the other 8 authors think!  (One of the authors is Richard Muller’s daughter Elizabeth, so maybe we shouldn’t count her as an independent view.)

The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).  Each of the plots overlays data from several databases (not necessarily indepenedent of each other), and you can select which ones to include or leave</p><p>5 0.1339419 <a title="837-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-20-Some_things_are_just_really_hard_to_believe%3A_more_on_choosing_your_facts..html">219 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-20-Some things are just really hard to believe: more on choosing your facts.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to think that Barack Obama is a Muslim and was born in Kenya.  But why?  People choose to be Republicans or Democrats because they prefer the policy or ideology of one party or another, and it’s not obvious that there should be any connection whatsoever between those factors and their judgment of a  factual  matter such as Obama’s religion or country of birth.  
 
In fact, people on opposite sides of many issues, such as gay marriage, immigration policy, global warming, and continued U.S. presence in Iraq, tend to disagree, often by a huge amount, on factual matters such as whether the children of gay couples have more psychological problems than the children of straight couples, what are the economic impacts of illegal immigration, what is the effect of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and so on. 
 
Of course, it makes sense that people with different judgment of the facts would have different views on policies: if you think ca</p><p>6 0.097498335 <a title="837-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-02-Selection_bias%2C_or%2C_How_you_can_think_the_experts_don%E2%80%99t_check_their_models%2C_if_you_simply_don%E2%80%99t_look_at_what_the_experts_actually_are_doing.html">1295 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-02-Selection bias, or, How you can think the experts don’t check their models, if you simply don’t look at what the experts actually are doing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: From the  Gallup Poll :
  
Four in 10 Americans, slightly fewer today than in years past, believe God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago.
  
They’ve been asking the question since 1982 and it’s been pretty steady at 45%, so in some sense this is good news!  (I’m saying this under the completely unsupported belief that it’s better for people to believe truths than falsehoods.)
  

 
One way to think of this is that, for the overwhelming majority of people, a personal belief in young-earth creationism (or whatever you want to call it) is costless.  Or, to put it another way, the discomfort involved in holding a belief that contradicts everything you were taught in school is greater than the discomfort involved in holding a belief that seems to contradict your religious values (keeping in mind that, even among those who report attending church seldom or never, a quarter of these people agree that “God created humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago”).</p><p>6 0.66277206 <a title="837-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-20-Some_things_are_just_really_hard_to_believe%3A_more_on_choosing_your_facts..html">219 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-20-Some things are just really hard to believe: more on choosing your facts.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sciencedaily has posted an article titled  Apes Unwilling to Gamble When Odds Are Uncertain :
  

The apes readily distinguished between the different probabilities of winning: they gambled a lot when there was a 100 percent chance, less when there was a 50 percent chance, and only rarely when there was no chance In some trials, however, the experimenter didn’t remove a lid from the bowl, so the apes couldn’t assess the likelihood of winning a banana The odds from the covered bowl were identical to those from the risky option: a 50 percent chance of getting the much sought-after banana. But apes of both species were less likely to choose this ambiguous option.

   

Like humans, they showed “ambiguity aversion” — preferring to gamble more when they knew the odds than when they didn’t. Given some of the other differences between chimps and bonobos, Hare and Rosati had expected to find the bonobos to be more averse to ambiguity, but that didn’t turn out to be the case.

<p>Introduction: Hear me interviewed on the topic  here .
 
P.S.  The interview was fine but I donâ&euro;&trade;t agree with everything on the linked website.  For example,  this  bit:
  
Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.  Global warming has many of the characteristics of a popular delusion, an irrational fear or cause that is embraced by millions of people because, well, it is believed by millions of people!
  
All right, then.</p><p>3 0.93302786 <a title="837-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-30-Rickey_Henderson_and_Peter_Angelos%2C_together_again.html">881 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-30-Rickey Henderson and Peter Angelos, together again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Today I was reminded of a riddle from junior high: 
Q:  What do you get when you cross an elephant with peanut butter? 
A:  Peanut butter that never forgets, or an elephant that sticks to the roof of your mouth.
 
The occasion was a  link  from Tyler Cowen to a new book by Garry Kasparov and . . . Peter Thiel.
 
Kasparov we all know about.  I still remember how he pulled out a victory in  the last game of his tournament with Karpov.  Just amazing:  he had to win the game, a draw would not be enough.  Both players knew that Kasparov had to win.  And he did it.  A feat as impressive as Kirk Gibson’s off-the-bench game-winning home run in the 1987 Series.
 
Peter Theil is a more obscure figure.  He’s been featured a  couple  of  times  on this blog and comes across as your typical overconfident rich dude.
 
It’s an odd combination, sort of like what you might get if Rickey Henderson and Peter Angelos were to write a book about how to reform baseball.  Cowen writes, “How can I not pre-orde</p><p>4 0.90539062 <a title="837-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-45%25_hitting%2C_25%25_fielding%2C_25%25_pitching%2C_and_100%25_not_telling_us_how_they_did_it.html">942 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-45% hitting, 25% fielding, 25% pitching, and 100% not telling us how they did it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A University of Delaware press release  reports :
  
This month, the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports will feature the article “An Estimate of How Hitting, Pitching, Fielding, and Base-stealing Impact Team Winning Percentages in Baseball.”  In it, University of Delaware Prof. Charles Pavitt of the Department of Communication defines the perfect “formula” for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams to use to build the ultimate winning team.


Pavitt found hitting accounts for more than 45 percent of teams’ winning records, fielding for 25 percent and pitching for 25 percent. And that the impact of stolen bases is greatly overestimated.


He crunched hitting, pitching, fielding and base-stealing records for every MLB team over a 48-year period from 1951-1998 with a method no other researcher has used in this area. In statistical parlance, he used a conceptual decomposition of offense and defense into its component parts and then analyzed recombinations of the parts in intuitively mea</p><p>5 0.89541829 <a title="837-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-25-Quantitative_Methods_in_the_Social_Sciences_M.A.%3A_Innovative%2C_interdisciplinary_social_science_research_program_for_a_data-rich_world.html">591 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-25-Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences M.A.: Innovative, interdisciplinary social science research program for a data-rich world</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 12 years ago Greg Wawro, Sy Spilerman, and I started a M.A. program here in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences, jointly between the departments of history, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and statistics.  We created a bunch of new features for the program, including an interdisciplinary course based on  this book .
  

 
And here’s their new logo:
 
 
 
Don’t blame me for the pie-chart motif!  Seriously, though, the program is great.  I’m proud to have gotten it started, and I’m impressed by the progress that Chris Weiss and others have made in expanding the program during the past decade.</p><p>6 0.89172184 <a title="837-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-08-How_to_solve_the_Post_Office%E2%80%99s_problems%3F.html">895 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-08-How to solve the Post Office’s problems?</a></p>

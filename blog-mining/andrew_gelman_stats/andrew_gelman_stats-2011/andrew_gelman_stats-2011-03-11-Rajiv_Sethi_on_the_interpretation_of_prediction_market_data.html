</p><p>6 Sethi looks at some of the transaction data and continues:    What, then, can one say about the distribution of beliefs in the market? [sent-10, score-0.433]
</p><p>7 To begin with, there is considerable disagreement about the outcome. [sent-11, score-0.281]
</p><p>8 Second, this disagreement itself is public information: it persists despite the fact that it is commonly known to exist. [sent-12, score-0.314]
</p><p>9 the fact of disagreement is not itself considered to be informative, and does not lead to further belief revision. [sent-16, score-0.337]
</p><p>10 The most likely explanation for this is that traders harbor doubts about the rationality or objectivity of other market participants. [sent-17, score-0.86]
</p><p>11 More generally, it is entirely possible that beliefs are distributed in a manner that is highly skewed around the price at last trade. [sent-21, score-0.604]
</p><p>12 That is, it could be the case that most traders (or the most confident traders) all fall on one side of the order book. [sent-22, score-0.387]
</p><p>13 In this case the arrival of seemingly minor pieces of information can cause a large swing in the market price. [sent-23, score-0.568]
</p><p>14 Sethi’s conclusion:    There is no meaningful sense in which one can interpret the price at last trade as an average or representative belief among the trading population. [sent-24, score-0.835]
</p><p>15 Markets are impressive mechanisms for information aggregation but they’re not magic. [sent-28, score-0.251]
</p><p>16 The information has to come from somewhere, and markets are inherently always living in the phase transition between stability and instability. [sent-29, score-0.577]
</p><p>17 (It is the stability that makes prices informative and the instability that allows the market to be liquid. [sent-30, score-0.848]

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . . It turns out, people have very inflated expectations for how much they call sell their used TV. Only 3 of the 26 televisions we analyzed were discounte</p><p>3 0.15603608 <a title="607-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-17-Futures_contracts%2C_Granger_causality%2C_and_my_preference_for_estimation_to_testing.html">212 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-17-Futures contracts, Granger causality, and my preference for estimation to testing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: José Iparraguirre writes:
  
There’s  a letter  in the latest issue of The Economist (July 31st) signed by Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), Michael Masters (Masters Capital Management) and David Frenk (Better Markets) about an    “>OECD report  on speculation and the prices of commodities, which includes the following: “The report uses a Granger causality test to measure the relationship between the level of commodities futures contracts held by swap dealers, and the prices of those commodities. Granger tests, however, are of dubious applicability to extremely volatile variables like commodities prices.”
  
The report says:
  
Granger causality is a standard statistical technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. It is important to bear in mind that the term causality is used in a statistical sense, and not in a philosophical one of structural causation. More precisely a variable A is said to Granger cause B if knowing the time paths of B and A toge</p><p>4 0.10755324 <a title="607-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-29-%E2%80%9CTobin%E2%80%99s_analysis_here_is_methodologically_old-fashioned_in_the_sense_that_no_attempt_is_made_to_provide_microfoundations_for_the_postulated_adjustment_processes%E2%80%9D.html">1035 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-29-“Tobin’s analysis here is methodologically old-fashioned in the sense that no attempt is made to provide microfoundations for the postulated adjustment processes”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi writes the above in a  discussion  of a misunderstanding of the economics of Keynes.
 
The discussion is interesting.  According to Sethi, Keynes wrote that, in a depression, nominal wages might be sticky but in any case a decline in wages would not do the trick to increase hiring.  But many modern economics writers have missed this. For example, Gary Becker writes, “Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in the downward direction. . . . A fall in price stimulates demand and reduces supply until they are brought back to rough equality.”  Whether Becker is empirically correct is another story, but in any case he is misinterpreting Keynes.
 
But the actual reason I’m posting here is in reaction to Sethi’s remark quoted in the title above, in which he endorses a 1975 paper by James Tobin on wages and employment but remarks that Tobin’s paper did not include the individual-level de</p><p>5 0.10726609 <a title="607-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-10-Bayes_jumps_the_shark.html">331 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-10-Bayes jumps the shark</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Goldin sends in this, from  an interview  with Alan Dershowitz:
  
 
Q:  The lawyerly obligation to not change your mind, to defend a position right or wrong–do you find that it seeps over into the rest of your life?





A:  No, it doesn’t because I’m a professor first, and as a professor I’m always changing my mind. I mean, my students go crazy in my class because I’m the most orthodox Bayesian in the world. [Bayesian probability theory is a way of modeling how the human mind reasons about the world. It assumes that people have prior beliefs about the probability of a given hypothesis and also beliefs about the probability that the hypothesis, if true, would generate the evidence they see. Taken together, these beliefs determine how people update their faith in a hypothesis in light of new evidence.] I do everything based on Bayes analysis, and Bayes analysis is always based on shifting probabilities and constantly changing and being adaptive and fluid.

<p>Introduction: I’m a few weeks behind in my New Yorker reading and so just recently read  this fascinating article  by Ryan Lizza on the current administration’s foreign policy.  He gives some insights into the transformation Obama from antiwar candidate to a president conducting three wars.
 
Speaking as a statistician, though, what grabbed my eye was a doctrine of journalist/professor/policymaker Samantha Power.  Lizza writes:
  
In 2002, after graduating from Harvard Law School, she wrote “A Problem from Hell,” which surveyed the grim history of six genocides committed in the twentieth century. Propounding a liberal-interventionist view, Power argued that “mass killing” on the scale of Rwanda or Bosnia must be prevented by other nations, including the United States. She wrote that America and its allies rarely have perfect information about when a regime is about to commit genocide; a President, therefore, must have “a bias toward belief” that massacres are imminent.

<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>5 0.65245616 <a title="607-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-21-The_Commissar_for_Traffic_presents_the_latest_Five-Year_Plan.html">2181 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-21-The Commissar for Traffic presents the latest Five-Year Plan</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do Paul Samuelson and the U.S. Department of Transportation have in common?
 
Phil Price points us to  this  news article by Clark Williams-Derry:
  
As the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin points out, the US Department of Transportation has been making the virtually identical vehicle travel forecasts for well over a decade. All of those forecasts project rapid and incessant growth in vehicle travel for as far as the eye can see. Meanwhile, actual traffic volumes have flattened out, and may actually be falling.


 


Each of the rising colored lines represents a forecast from a different year.  The black line represents actual traffic trends on US roads—which never rose as quickly as the forecasters had predicted, and actually started a modest decline in 2007.
  
I’d like to see a label on the y-axis, and I’d recommend labeling the x-axis at 5-year intervals rather than every year, but the point seems pretty clear.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi has some  very interesting things to say :
  
As the election season draws closer, considerable attention will be paid to prices in prediction markets such as Intrade. Contracts for potential presidential nominees are already being scrutinized for early signs of candidate strength. . . .


This interpretation of prices as probabilities is common and will be repeated frequently over the coming months. But what could the “perceived likelihood according to the market” possibly mean?


Prediction market prices contain valuable information about this distribution of beliefs, but  there is no basis for the common presumption that the price at last trade represents the beliefs of a hypothetical average trader  in any meaningful sense [emphasis added]. In fact, to make full use of market data to make inferences about the distribution of beliefs, one needs to look beyond the price at last trade and examine the entire order book.

<p>Introduction: A colleague recently sent me a copy of some articles on the estimation of treatment interactions (a topic that’s interested me for awhile).  One of the articles, which appeared in the Lancet in 2000, was called “ Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials ,” by Susan F. Assmann, Stuart J. Pocock, Laura E. Enos, and Linda E. Kasten. . . . 
 
Hey, wait a minute–I know Susan Assmann!  Well, I sort of know her.  When I was a freshman in college, I asked my adviser, who was an applied math prof, if I could do some research.  He connected me to Susan, who was one of his Ph.D. students, and she gave me a tiny part of her thesis to work on.
 
The problem went as follows.  You have a function f(x), for x going from 0 to infinity, that is defined as follows.  Between 0 and 1, f(x)=x.  Then, for x higher than 1, f’(x) = f(x) – f(x-1).  The goal is to figure out what f(x) does.  I think I’m getting this right here, but I might be getting confused on some of the detai</p><p>3 0.98769671 <a title="607-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>4 0.98758709 <a title="607-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-02-Graphical_communication_for_legal_scholarship.html">1096 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-02-Graphical communication for legal scholarship</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following  my talk  on infovis and statistical graphics at the  Empirical Legal Studies conference , Dan Kahan writes:
  
The legal academy, which is making strides toward sensible integration of a variety of empirical methods into its scholarship, is horribly ignorant of the utility of graphic reporting of data, a likely influence of the formative influence that econometric methods has exerted on expectations and habits of mind among legal scholars. Lee Epstein has written a pair of wonderful articles on graphic reporting –

<p>Introduction: What better way to start then new year than with some hard-core statistical theory?
 
Ryan Martin and Chuanhai Liu send along  a new paper  on inferential models:
  
Probability is a useful tool for describing uncertainty, so it is natural to strive for a system of statistical inference based on probabilities for or against various hypotheses. But existing probabilistic inference methods struggle to provide a meaningful interpretation of the probabilities across experiments in sufficient generality. In this paper we further develop a promising new approach based on what are called inferential models (IMs). The fundamental idea behind IMs is that there is an unobservable auxiliary variable that itself describes the inherent uncertainty about the parameter of interest, and that posterior probabilistic inference can be accomplished by predicting this unobserved quantity. We describe a simple and intuitive three-step construction of a random set of candidate parameter values, each being co</p><p>6 0.98707473 <a title="607-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-27-Geophysicist_Discovers_Modeling_Error_%28in_Economics%29.html">976 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-27-Geophysicist Discovers Modeling Error (in Economics)</a></p>

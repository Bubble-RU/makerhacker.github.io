<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>4 0.15606327 <a title="636-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-10-What_happens_when_the_Democrats_are_%E2%80%9Cfighting_Wall_Street_with_one_hand%2C_unions_with_the_other%2C%E2%80%9D_while_the_Republicans_are_fighting_unions_with_two_hands%3F.html">79 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-10-What happens when the Democrats are “fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other,” while the Republicans are fighting unions with two hands?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias noticed something interesting in a political story today that reminds me of one of our arguments in Red State, Blue State.  I have the feeling that most readers of this blog are less fascinated than I am by U.S. politics, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
  

 
Yglesias  quotes  a Washington Post article on Blanche Lincoln returning to the U.S. Senate after surviving a primary challenge from a candidate supported by organized labor:
  
Lincoln was embraced by her colleagues . . . Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) held up two fists and said of her primary campaign: “Fighting Wall Street with one hand, unions with the other.”
  
Yglesias points out a fundamental asymmetry here:
  
Schumer, who’s become something of a national leader among Senate Democrats, celebrates this ideal [of governing in a manner that's equidistant from rival interest groups], but there’s not a single member of the Republican Party–much less a leader–who’d say anything remotely similar. Schumer is basi</p><p>5 0.11900247 <a title="636-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-23-Popular_governor%2C_small_state.html">159 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-23-Popular governor, small state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, upon the selection of Sarah Palin as vice-presidential nominee, I made some graphs of the popularity of governors of different-sized states:
 
 
 
As I wrote  at the time :
 
It seems to be easier to maintain high approval in a small state. What’s going on? Some theories: in a large state, there will be more ambitious politicians on the other side, eager to knock off the incumbent governor; small states often have part-time legislatures and thus the governor is involved in less political conflict; small states (notably Alaska) tend to get more funds per capita from the federal government, and it’s easier to be popular when you can disburse more funds; large states tend to be more heterogeneous and so it’s harder to keep all the voters happy.
 
I was curious how things have been going more recently, and Hanfei made an updated graph using data from  this archive .  Here’s the story:

<p>Introduction: Here are my answers  to the following questions asked by Pauline Peretz:
 
1. Many analysts have emphasized that there was a redrawing of the electoral map in 2008. To what extent will the November midterm elections affect this red-blue map? How long will the newly blue states remain blue? 
 
2. Do you think the predictable loss of the Democrats in November definitely disqualifies the hypothesis that Obama’s election was the beginning of a realignment in American politics, that is a period of dominance for the Democratic party due to favourable demographics?
 
3. Some analysts consider that voting patterns are best explained by economic factors, others by values. How do you position yourself in the debate on culture wars vs. economic wars?
 
4. In your book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, you renew the ongoing debate on the correlation between income and vote, showing it is much stronger in poor states.

As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. . . .


The unspoken truth is that, compared to “blue-staters,” those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies.
  
An unspoken truth, huh?  Wow, that really sucks!  Something should be done about it.  Good thing that this Harvard professor and former member of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors is on the case:

<p>Introduction: After noting the increasing political conservatism of people in the poorer states, Richard Florida  writes :
  
The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism’s hold on America’s states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal.


Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward.


But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political. This ideological state of affairs advantages the policy preferences of poorer, less innovative states over wealthier, more innovative, and productive ones. American politics is increasingly disconnected from its economic engine.  And this deepening political divide has become pe</p><p>2 0.92441916 <a title="636-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-06-The_K_Foundation_burns_Cosma%E2%80%99s_turkey.html">1044 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-06-The K Foundation burns Cosma’s turkey</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Shalizi  delivers  a slow, drawn-out illustration of the point that economic efficiency is all about who’s got the $, which isn’t always related to what we would usually call “efficiency” in other settings.  (His point is related to my  argument  that the phrase “willingness to pay” should generally be replaced by “ability to pay.”)
 
The basic story is simple:  Good guy  needs  a turkey, bad guy  wants  a turkey.  Bad guy is willing and able to pay more for the turkey than good guy can afford, hence good guy starves to death.
 
The counterargument is that a market in turkeys will motivate producers to breed more turkeys, ultimately saturating the bad guys’ desires and leaving surplus turkeys for the good guys at a reasonable price.
 
I’m sure there’s a counter-counterargument too, but I don’t want to go there.
 
But what really amused me about Cosma’s essay was how he scrambled the usual cultural/political associations.  (I assume he did this on purpose.)

<p>Introduction: Uberbloggers  Andrew Sullivan  and  Matthew Yglesias  were kind enough to link to my five-year-old post with graphs from Red State Blue State on time trends of average income by state.
 
Here are the  graphs : 
   
 
 
Yglesias’s take-home point:
  
There isn’t that much change over time in states’ economic well-being. All things considered the best predictor of how rich a state was in 2000 was simply how rich it was in 1929…. Massachusetts and Connecticut have always been rich and Arkansas and Mississippi have always been poor.
  
I’d like to point to a different feature of the graphs, which is that, although the  rankings  of the states haven’t changed much (as can be seen from the “2000 compared to 1929″ scale), the relative  values  of the incomes have converged quite a bit—at least, they converged from about 1930 to 1980 before hitting some level of stability.  And the rankings have changed a bit.  My impression (without checking the numbers) is that New York and Connecticut were</p><p>4 0.90644449 <a title="636-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-22-%E2%80%9CInformation_visualization%E2%80%9D_vs._%E2%80%9CStatistical_graphics%E2%80%9D.html">816 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-22-“Information visualization” vs. “Statistical graphics”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By now you all must be tired of my one-sided presentations of the differences between infovis and statgraphics (for example,  this article  with Antony Unwin).
 
Today is something different.  Courtesy of Martin Theus, editor of the Statistical Computing and Graphics Newsletter, we have two short articles offering competing perspectives:
 
Robert Kosara writes from an Infovis view:
  
Information visualization is a field that has had trouble defining its boundaries, and that consequently is often misunderstood. It doesn’t help that InfoVis, as it is also known, produces pretty pictures that people like to look at and link to or send around. But InfoVis is more than pretty pictures, and it is more than statistical graphics.


The key to understanding InfoVis is to ignore the images for a moment and focus on the part that is often lost: interaction. When we use visualization tools, we don’t just create one image or one kind of visualization. In fact, most people would argue that there is</p><p>5 0.90055537 <a title="636-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-25-It%E2%80%99s_binless%21__A_program_for_computing_normalizing_functions.html">1825 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-25-It’s binless!

I have created  an R package  to implement the full likelihood method in Kong et al. (2003). The method can be seen as a binless extension of so-called Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (UWHAM) widely used in physics and chemistry. The method has also been introduced to the physics literature and called the Multivariate Bennet Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method. But a key point of my implementation is to compute the free energy estimates by minimizing a convex function, instead of solving nonlinear equations by the self-consistency or the Newton-Raphson algorithm.</p><p>6 0.90002501 <a title="636-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-18-Predictive_checks_for_hierarchical_models.html">154 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-18-Predictive checks for hierarchical models</a></p>

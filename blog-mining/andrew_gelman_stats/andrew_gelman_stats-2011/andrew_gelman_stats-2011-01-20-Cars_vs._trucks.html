	A colleague is looking at data on car (and SUV and light truck) collisions and casualties.  He’s interested in causal relationships.  For instance, suppose car manufacturers try to improve gas mileage without decreasing acceleration.  The most likely way they will do that is to make cars lighter.  But perhaps lighter cars are more dangerous; how many more people will die for each mpg increase in gas mileage?
 
	There are a few different data sources, all of them seriously deficient from the standpoint of answering this question.  Deaths are very well reported, so if someone dies in an auto accident you can find out what kind of car they were in, what other kinds of cars (if any) were involved in the accident, whether the person was a driver or passenger, and so on.

<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.

Matching is not an identification strategy a solution to your endogeneity problem; it is a weighting scheme. Saying matching will reduce endogeneity bias is like saying that the best way to get thin is to weigh yourself in kilos. The statement makes no sense. It confuses technique with substance. . . . When you run a regression, you control for the X you can observe. When you match, you are simply matching based on those same X. . . .
  
I see what Chris is getting at–matching, like regression, won’t help for the variables you’re not controlling for–but I disagree with his characterization of matching as a weighting scheme.  I see matching as a way to restrict your analysis to comparable cases.  The statistical motivation:  robustness.  If you had a good enough model, you wouldn’t neet to match, you’d just fit the model to the data.  But in common practice we often use simple regression models and so it can be helpful to do some matching first before regress</p><p>6 0.0918516 <a title="527-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-%E2%80%9CTexting_bans_don%E2%80%99t_reduce_crashes%3B_effects_are_slight_crash_increases%E2%80%9D.html">307 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-“Texting bans don’t reduce crashes; effects are slight crash increases”</a></p>

I have a question regarding a randomizing constraint in my current funded electricity experiment. 


After elimination of missing data we have 110 voluntary households from a larger population (resource constraints do not allow us to have more households!). I randomly assign them to threated and non treated where the treatment variable is some ICT that allows the treated to track their electricity consumption in real tim. The ICT is made of two devices, one that is plugged on the household’s modem and the other on the electric meter. A necessary condition for being treated is that the distance between the box and the meter be below some threshold (d), the value of which is 20 meters approximately. 


50 ICTs can be installed. 
60 households will be in the control group.


But, I can only assign 6 households in the control group for whom d is less than 20. Therefore, I have only 6 households in the control group who have a counterfactual in the group of treated.</p><p>4 0.72628105 <a title="527-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation_to_check_missing-data_imputation.html">1330 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation to check missing-data imputation</a></p>

I have questions regarding one technique you and your colleagues described in your papers: the cross validation (Multiple Imputation with Diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening Windows into the Black Box, with reference to Gelman, King, and Liu, 1998). I think this is the technique I need for my purpose, but I am not sure I understand it right. I want to use the multiple imputation to estimate the outcome of psychotherapies based on longitudinal data. First I have to demonstrate that I am able to get unbiased estimates with the multiple imputation. The expected bias is the overestimation of the outcome of dropouts.


I will test my imputation strategies by means of a series of simulations (delete values, impute, compare with the original). Due to the complexity of the statistical analyses I think I need at least 200 cases. Now I don’t have so many cases without any missings. My data have missing values in different variables.

In your blog your advice for performing regression  in the presence of large numbers of correlated features, has been to use composite scores and hierarchical modeling. Unfortunately, many problems don’t provide an obvious and unambiguous way of grouping features together (e.g. gene expression data). Are there any techniques that you would recommend that automatically pool correlated features together based on the data, without requiring the researcher to manually define composite scores or feature hierarchies?
  
I don’t know the answer to this but I imagine something is possible . . . any ideas?

<p>Introduction: Saw Argo the other day, was impressed by the way it was filmed in such a 70s style, sorta like that movie The Limey or an episode of the Rockford Files.
 
I also felt nostalgia for that relatively nonviolent era.  All those hostages and nobody was killed.  It’s a good thing the Ayatollah didn’t have some fundamentalist Shiite equivalent of John Yoo telling him to waterboard everybody.
 
At the time we were all so angry and upset about the hostage-taking, but from the perspective of our suicide-bomber era, that whole hostage episode seems so comfortingly mild.</p><p>2 0.93570155 <a title="527-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-04-Estimating_the_effect_of_A_on_B%2C_and_also_the_effect_of_B_on_A.html">393 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-04-Estimating the effect of A on B, and also the effect of B on A</a></p>

I am working with clinicians in infectious disease and international health to study the (possible causal) relation between malnutrition and virus infection episodes (e.g., diarrhea) in babies in developing countries.


Basically the clinicians are interested in two questions: does malnutrition cause more diarrhea episodes? does diarrhea lead to malnutrition? The malnutrition status is indicated by height and weight (adjusted, HAZ and WAZ measures) observed every 3 months from birth to 1 year. They also recorded the time of each diarrhea episode during the 1 year follow-up period. They have very solid datasets for analysis.


As you can see, this is almost like a chicken and egg problem. I am a layman to causal inference. The method I use is just to do some simple regression. For example, to study the causal relation from malnutrition to diarrhea episodes, I use binary variable (diarrhea yes/no during months 0-3) as response, and use the HAZ at month 0 as covariate</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90902042 <a title="527-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-20-Cars_vs._trucks.html">527 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-20-Cars vs. trucks</a></p>

I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Illinois. . . . My main work is in supply chain area, and empirical in nature. . . . I am working with a firm that has two separate divisions – one making cars, and the other makes trucks. Four years back, the firm made an interesting organizational change. They created a separate group of ~25 engineers, in their car division (from within their quality and production engineers). This group was focused on improving supplier quality and reported to car plant head . The truck division did not (and still does not) have such an independent “supplier improvement group”. Other than this unit in car, the organizational arrangements in the two divisions mimic each other.  There are many common suppliers to the car and truck division.


Data on quality of components coming from suppliers has been collected (for the last four years). The organizational change happened in January 2007.

<p>Introduction: I saw this graph  posted  by Tyler Cowen:
 
   
 
and my first thought was that the bar plot should be replaced by a line plot:  Six lines, one for each income category, with each line being a time series of these changes.  With a line plot, you can more easily see each time series (these are hard to see in the barplot because you have to follow each color and jump from decade to decade) and also compare the patterns for each category.  The line plot pretty much dominates the bar plot.
 
At least that was the theory.  Now here’s what actually happened.
 
I downloaded the data as Excel files, saved them as csv, then read them into R.  In all, it took close to an hour to get the data set up in the format that was needed to make the graphs.  At this point it was pretty easy to make the line plot.  But the result was disappointing:
 
   
 
The six lines are hard to untangle (sure, a better color scheme might help, but it wouldn’t really solve the problem) and the graph as a whole is much l</p><p>6 0.8706277 <a title="527-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-Interactions_of_predictors_in_a_causal_model.html">251 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-Interactions of predictors in a causal model</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following email: 
  
  
I am trying to develop a Bayesian model to represent the process through which individual consumers make online product rating decisions. In my model each individual faces total J product options and for each product option (j) each individual (i) needs to make three sequential decisions: 


- First he decides whether to consume a specific product option (j) or not (choice decision)


- If he decides to consume a product option j, then after consumption he decides whether to rate it or not (incidence decision) 


- If he decides to rate product j then what finally he decides what rating (k) to assign to it (evaluation decision)


We  model this decision sequence in terms of three equations. A binary response variable in the first equation represents the choice decision. Another binary response variable in the second equation represents the incidence decision that is observable only when first selection decision is 1. Finally, an ordered response v</p><p>3 0.18419106 <a title="577-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-23-Thinking_of_doing_a_list_experiment%3F__Here%E2%80%99s_a_list_of_reasons_why_you_should_think_again.html">2303 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-23-Thinking of doing a list experiment?

<p>Introduction: Someone wrote in:
  
We are about to conduct a voting list experiment. We came across your  comment  recommending that each item be removed from the list.  Would greatly appreciate it if you take a few minutes to spell out your recommendation in a little more detail. In particular: (a) Why are you “uneasy” about list experiments? What would strengthen your confidence in list experiments? (b) What do you mean by “each item be removed”? As you know, there are several non-sensitive items and one sensitive item in a list experiment. Do you mean that the non-sensitive items should be removed one-by-one for the control group or are you suggesting a multiple arm design in which each arm of the experiment has one non-sensitive item removed. What would be achieved by this design?
  
I replied:  I’ve always been a bit skeptical about list experiments, partly because I worry that the absolute number of items on the list could itself affect the response.  For example, someone might not want to che</p><p>4 0.12831974 <a title="577-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-30-Convenient_page_of_data_sources_from_the_Washington_Post.html">1146 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-30-Convenient page of data sources from the Washington Post</a></p>

Lots of obscure European languages there.  That got me wondering:  what’s the least obscure language  not  on the above list?  Igbo?  Swahili?  Or maybe Tagalog?
 
I did a quick google and found  this  list of languages by number of native speakers.  Once you see the list, the answer is obvious:  Hindi, first language of 295 million people, is not on Apple’s list.  The next most popular languages not included:  Bengali, Punjabi, Javanese, Wu, Telegu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu.  Wow:  most of these are Indian!  Then comes Persian and a bunch of others.
 
It turns out that Tagalog, Igbo, and Swahili, are way down on this list with 28 million, 24 million, and 26 million native speakers, respectively.
 
Only 26 million for Swahili?  This made me want to check the  list of languages by total number of speakers .  The ranking of most of the languages isn’t much different, but Swahili is now #10, at 140 million.  Hindi and Bengali are still th</p><p>3 0.65962362 <a title="577-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-Huh%3F.html">1915 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-Huh?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 1.  Freakonomics  characterizes  drunk driving as an example of “the human tendency to worry about rare problems that are unlikely to happen.”
 
2.  The CDC  reports , “Alcohol-impaired drivers are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.”
 
No offense to the tenured faculty at the University of Chicago, but I’m going with the CDC on this one. 
   
P.S.  The Freakonomics blog deserves to be dinged another time, not just for claiming, based on  implausible assumptions  and making the all-else-equal  fallacy  that “drunk walking is 8 times more likely to result in your death than drunk driving” but for presenting this weak inference as a fact rather than as a speculation.
 
When doing “Freakonomics,” you can be counterintuitive, or you can be sensible, but it’s hard to be both. I mean, sure, sometimes you can be. But there’s a tradeoff, and in this case, they’re choosing to push the envelope on counterintuitiveness.</p><p>3 0.86109555 <a title="577-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-30-Systematic_review_of_publication_bias_in_studies_on_publication_bias.html">1291 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-30-Systematic review of publication bias in studies on publication bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>4 0.8508119 <a title="577-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-10-Recently_in_the_sister_blog%3A__Brussels_sprouts%2C_ugly_graphs%2C_and_switched_at_birth.html">1664 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-10-Recently in the sister blog:  Brussels sprouts, ugly graphs, and switched at birth</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions.. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
 
 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>6 0.83300489 <a title="577-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-%E2%80%9CCity_Opens_Inquiry_on_Grading_Practices_at_a_Top-Scoring_Bronx_School%E2%80%9D.html">529 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-“City Opens Inquiry on Grading Practices at a Top-Scoring Bronx School”</a></p>

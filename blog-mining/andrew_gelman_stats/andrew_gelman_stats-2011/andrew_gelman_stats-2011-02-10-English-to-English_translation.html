<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>3 0.10839777 <a title="567-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-01-Separated_by_a_common_blah_blah_blah.html">2119 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-01-Separated by a common blah blah blah</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love reading the kind of English that English people write.  It’s the same language as American but just slightly different.  I was thinking about this recently after coming across this footnote from “Yeah Yeah Yeah:  The Story of Modern Pop,” by Bob Stanley:
  
Mantovani’s atmospheric arrangement on ‘Care Mia’, I should add, is something else.  Genuinely celestial.  If anyone with a degree of subtlety was singing, it would be quite a record.
  
It’s hard for me to pin down exactly what makes this passage specifically English, but there’s something about it . . .
 
P.S.  Mark Liberman  reports  that, in combination, several of the words and phrases in the above quote indeed supply strong evidence (“odds of better than 50 to 1 in favor of a British origin”).</p><p>4 0.093299396 <a title="567-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-03-%E2%80%9CIt_was_the_opinion_of_the_hearing_that_the_publication_of_the_article_had_brought_the_School_into_disrepute.%E2%80%9D.html">941 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-03-“It was the opinion of the hearing that the publication of the article had brought the School into disrepute.”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”
  
This sounds fascinating.  But I’m skeptical about this part:

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  reports  on the sympathy that well-known physicist Freeman Dyson has with crackpot theorists.  The interesting part is that Dyson has positive feelings for these cranks,  even while believing that their theories are completely wrong :
  
In my [Dyson's] career as a scientist, I twice had the good fortune to be a personal friend of a famous dissident. One dissident, Sir Arthur Eddington, was an insider like Thomson and Tait. The other, Immanuel Velikovsky, was an outsider like Carter. Both of them were tragic figures, intellectually brilliant and morally courageous, with the same fatal flaw as Carter. Both of them were possessed by fantasies that people with ordinary common sense could recognize as nonsense. I made it clear to both that I did not believe their fantasies, but I admired them as human beings and as imaginative artists. I admired them most of all for their stubborn refusal to remain silent. With the whole world against them, they remained true to their beliefs.</p><p>3 0.81015968 <a title="567-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell_and_Chabris%2C_David_and_Goliath%2C_and_science_writing_as_stone_soup.html">2058 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-11-Gladwell and Chabris, David and Goliath, and science writing as stone soup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The only thing is, I’m not sure who’s David here and who is Goliath.  From the standpoint of book sales, Gladwell is Goliath for sure.  On the other hand, Gladwell’s credibility has been weakened over the years by fights with bigshots such as Steven Pinker.  Maybe the best analogy is a boxing match where Gladwell stands in the ring and fighter after fighter is sent in to bang him up.  At some point the heavyweight gets a little bit tired. (Recently Gladwell had a New Yorker column defending dopers such as Lance Armstrong, so I suspect he’ll have Kaiser Fung  coming  after him  again , once the current lucha with Chabris is over.)
 
Chabris took his swing at Gladwell a few days ago, as I reported  here .
 
Yesterday was Gladwell’s  turn .  I have a lot of sympathy for the Blink-man here:  he writes these bestsellers and puts himself out there, so he’s a target.  If Gladwell’s books were generic business-bestseller pap of the be-yourself-and-be-tough variety, he wouldn’t get hassled.

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.  When learning science, we sometimes speak</p><p>5 0.7960906 <a title="567-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-27-%E2%80%9CThe_ultimate_left-wing_novel%E2%80%9D.html">682 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-27-“The ultimate left-wing novel”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  asks  what is the ultimate left-wing novel?  He comes up with John Steinbeck and refers us to  this list  by Josh Leach that includes soclal-realist novels from around 1900.  But Cowen is looking for something more “analytically or philosophically comprehensive.”
 
My vote for the ultimate left-wing novel is 1984.  The story and the political philosophy fit together well, and it’s also widely read (which is an important part of being the “ultimate” novel of any sort, I think; it wouldn’t do to choose something too obscure).  Or maybe Gulliver’s Travels, but I’ve never actually read that, so I don’t know if it qualifies as being left-wing.  Certainly you can’t get much more political than 1984, and I don’t think you can get much more left-wing either.  (If you get any more left-wing than that, you start to loop around the circle and become right-wing.  For example, I don’t think that a novel extolling the brilliance of Stalin or Mao would be considered left-wing in a modern</p><p>6 0.79192823 <a title="567-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-30-Real_rothko%2C_fake_rothko.html">1553 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-30-Real rothko, fake rothko</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s not just for Chaucer (or Mad Max) anymore.   Peter Frase writes:
  
It’s a shame that we neglect to re-translate older works into English merely because they were originally written in English. Languages change, and our reactions to words and formulations change. This is obvious when you read something like Chaucer, but it’s true to a more subtle degree of more recent writings. There is a pretty good chance that something written in the 19th century won’t mean the same thing to us that it meant to its contemporary readers. Thus it would make sense to re-translate Huckleberry Finn into modern language, in the same way we periodically get new translations of Homer or Dante or Thomas Mann. This is a point that applies equally well to non-fiction and social theory: in some ways, English-speaking sociologists are lucky that our canonical trio of classical theorists-Marx, Weber, and Durkheim-all wrote in another language. The most recent translation of Capital is eminently more readable</p><p>2 0.84191811 <a title="567-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-07-Scientific_fraud%2C_double_standards_and_institutions_protecting_themselves.html">1448 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-07-Scientific fraud, double standards and institutions protecting themselves</a></p>

After reading your recent  post , I thought you might find  this  interesting – especially the scanned interview that is included at the bottom of the posting. It’s an old OMNI interview with Walter Stewart that was the first thing I read (at a young and impressionable age ;) about the prevalence of errors, fraud and cheating in science, the institutional barriers to tackling it, the often high personal costs to whistleblowers, the difficulty of accessing scientific data to repeat published analyses, and the surprisingly negative attitude towards criticism within scientific communities. Highly recommended entertaining reading – with some good examples of scientific investigations into implausible effects. The post itself contains the info I once dug up about what happened to him later – he seems like an interesting and very determined guy: when the NIH tried to stop him from investigating scientific errors and fraud he went on a hunger strike.

<p>Introduction: Lee Seachrest points to  an article , “Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data,” by James Vaupel, Zhen Zhang, and Alyson van Raalte.  This paper has killer graphs.  Here are their results:
  
In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.
  
   
 
The authors also note:
  
Reducing early-life disparities helps people plan their less-uncertain lifetimes.

<p>Introduction: My Columbia colleague Sheena Iyengar (most famous among ARM readers for her speed-dating experiment) writes an interesting  column  on potential reactions to a tax on sugary drinks.  The idea is that people might be so annoyed at being told what to do that they might buy more of the stuff, at least in the short term.
 
On the other hand, given the famous subsidies involved in the production of high-fructose corn syrup, soda pop is probably a bit cheaper than it should be, so maybe it all balances out?
 
I agree with Sheena that there’s something about loss of control that is particularly frustrating.  One thing that bugs me when I buy a Coke is that I’m paying for the fees of Michael Jordan or whoever it is they have nowadays endorsing their product.  I wish there were some way I could just pay for everything else but withhold the money that’s going into those silly celebrity endorsements.</p><p>5 0.82148373 <a title="567-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-21-Could_I_use_a_statistics_coach%3F.html">968 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-21-Could I use a statistics coach?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a thought-provoking article subtitled “Top athletes and singers have coaches. Should you?,” surgeon/journalist Atul Gawande  describes  how, even after eight years and more than two thousand operations, he benefited from coaching (from a retired surgeon), just as pro athletes and accomplished musicians do.  He then talks about proposals to institute coaching for teachers to help them perform better.
 
This all makes sense to me—except that I’m a little worried about expansion of the teacher coaching program.  I can imagine it could work pretty well for teachers who are motivated to be coached—for example, I think I would get a lot out of it—but I’m afraid that if teacher coaching became a big business, it would get taken over by McKinsey-style scam artists.
 
But could I use a coach?
 
First, let me get rid of the easy questions.
 
1.  Yes, I could use a squash coach.  I enjoy squash and play when I can, but I’m terrible at it.  I’m sure a coach would help.

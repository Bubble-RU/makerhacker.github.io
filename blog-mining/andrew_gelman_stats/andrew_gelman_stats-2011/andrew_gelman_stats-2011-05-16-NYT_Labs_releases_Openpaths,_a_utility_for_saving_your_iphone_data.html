I’m not sure a Q&A; site is the best way to do this. 
 
My pipe dream is to create a taxonomy of variables and instances, and collect spreadsheets annotated this way. Imagine doing a search of type: “give me datasets, where an instance is a person, the variables are age, gender and weight” – and out would come datasets, each one tagged with the descriptions of the variables that were held constant for the whole dataset (person_type=student, location=Columbia, time_of_study=1/1/2009, study_type=longitudinal). It would even be possible to automatically convert one variable into another, if it was necessary (like age = time_of_measurement-time_of_birth). Maybe the dream of  Semantic Web  will actually be implemented for relatively structured statistical data rather than much fuzzier “knowledge”, just consider the difficulties of developing a universal  Freebase .

<p>Introduction: Ricardo Pietrobon writes, regarding my  post  from last year on attitudes toward data graphics,
  
Wouldn’t it be the case to start formally studying the usability of graphics from a cognitive perspective? with platforms such as the mechanical turk it should be fairly straightforward to test alternative methods and come to some conclusions about what might be more informative and what might better assist in supporting decisions. btw, my guess is that these two constructs might not necessarily agree with each other.
  
And Jessica Hullman provides some background: 
  
  
Measuring success for the different goals that you hint at in your article is indeed challenging, and I don’t think that most visualization researchers would claim to have met this challenge (myself included).

Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching OpenDataLatinoamerica.org, a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.


We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain. Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight International Journalism Fellows.

Also see  DataMarket ,  InfoChimps , and a few older links in  The Future of Data Analysis .

<p>Introduction: A year ago we  blogged  about Ian Fellows’s R Gui called  Deducer  (oops, my bad, I meant to  link to this ).
 
Fellows sends in this update:
  

 
Since version 0.1, I [Fellows] have added:
  
1. A nice plug-in interface, so that people can extend Deducer’s capability without leaving the comfort of R. (see: http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Development )


2. Several new dialogs.


3. A one-step installer for windows.


4. A plug-in package (DeducerExtras) which extends the scope of analyses covered.


5. A plotting GUI that can create anything from simple histograms to complex custom graphics.


Deducer is designed to be a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common data manipulation and analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is two fold.

<p>Introduction: There is a lot of data on the web, meant to be looked at by people, but how do you turn it into a spreadsheet people could actually  analyze  statistically? 
 
The technique to turn web pages intended for people into structured data sets intended for computers is called “screen scraping.” It has just been made easier with a wiki/community  http://scraperwiki.com/ . 
 
They provide libraries to extract information from PDF, Excel files, to automatically fill in forms and similar. Moreover, the community aspect of it should allow researchers doing similar things to get connected. It’s very good. Here’s an example of scraping  road accident data  or  port of London ship arrivals .
 
You can already find collections of structured data online, examples are  Infochimps  (“find the world’s data”), and  Freebase  (“An entity graph of people, places and things, built by a community that loves open data.”).

<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

 
The hazards posed by climate change, sea level rise, and severe storm surges make this the time to transform our coastal cities through adaptive design. The conventional response to flooding, in recent history, has been hard engineering — fortifying the coastal infrastructure with seawalls and bulkheads to protect real estate at the expense of natural t</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86600482 <a title="714-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-16-NYT_Labs_releases_Openpaths%2C_a_utility_for_saving_your_iphone_data.html">714 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-16-NYT Labs releases Openpaths, a utility for saving your iphone data</a></p>

 We launched Openpaths  the other week.  It’s a site where people can privately upload and view their iPhone location data (at least until an Apple update wipes it out) and also download their data for their own use.  More than just giving people a neat tool to view their data with, however, we’re also creating an option for them to donate their data to research projects at varying levels of anonymity.  We’re still working out the terms for that, but we’d love any input and to get in touch with anyone who might want to use the data.
  
I don’t have any use for this personally but maybe it will interest some of you.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>4 0.85590106 <a title="714-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-04-Burgess_on_Kipling.html">16 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-04-Burgess on Kipling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is my last entry derived from  Anthony Burgess’s book reviews , and it’ll be short.  His review of Angus Wilson’s “The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling:  His Life and Works” is a wonderfully balanced little thing.  Nothing incredibly deep–like most items in the collection, the review is only two pages long–but I give it credit for being a rare piece of Kipling criticism I’ve seen that (a) seriously engages with the politics, without (b) congratulating itself on bravely going against the fashions of the politically incorrect chattering classes by celebrating Kipling’s magnificent achievement blah blah blah.  Instead, Burgess shows respect for Kipling’s work and puts it in historical, biographical, and literary context.
 
Burgess concludes that Wilson’s book “reminds us, in John Gross’s words, that Kipling ‘remains a haunting, unsettling presence, with whom we still have to come to terms.’  Still.”  Well put, and generous of Burgess to end his review with another’s quote.

<p>Introduction: Commenter Rahul  asked  what I thought of this  note  by Scott Firestone ( link  from Tyler Cowen) criticizing a recent  discussion  by Kevin Drum suggesting that lead exposure causes violent crime.  Firestone writes: 
  
  
It turns out there was in fact a prospective study done—but its implications for Drum’s argument are mixed. The study was a cohort study done by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. Between 1979 and 1984, 376 infants were recruited. Their parents consented to have lead levels in their blood tested over time; this was matched with records over subsequent decades of the individuals’ arrest records, and specifically arrest for violent crime. Ultimately, some of these individuals were dropped from the study; by the end, 250 were selected for the results.


The researchers found that for each increase of 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, there was a higher risk for being arrested for a violent crime, but a further look at the numbers shows a more mixe</p><p>6 0.82904148 <a title="714-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-09-Understanding_predictive_information_criteria_for_Bayesian_models.html">1975 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-09-Understanding predictive information criteria for Bayesian models</a></p>

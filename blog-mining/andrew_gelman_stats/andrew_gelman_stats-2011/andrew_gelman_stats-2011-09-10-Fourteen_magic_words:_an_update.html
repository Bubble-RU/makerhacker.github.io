<p>Introduction: 2. Which of the following are useful goals in a pilot study? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) You can search for statistical significance, then from that decide what to look for in a confirmatory analysis of your full dataset.
 
(b) You can see if you find statistical significance in a pre-chosen comparison of interest.
 
(c) You can examine the direction (positive or negative, even if not statistically significant) of comparisons of interest.
 
(d) With a small sample size, you cannot hope to learn anything conclusive, but you can get a crude estimate of effect size and standard deviation which will be useful in a power analysis to help you decide how large your full study needs to be.
 
(e) You can talk with survey respondents and get a sense of how they perceived your questions.
 
(f) You get a chance to learn about practical difficulties with sampling, nonresponse, and question wording.
 
(g) You can check if your sample is approximately representative of your population.

Give an estimate of the probability that a nonvoter will falsely state that he or she voted. (Assume that all voters honestly report that they voted.)

<p>Introduction: Josef Fruehwald  writes :
  
In the past few years, the empirical foundations of the social sciences, especially Psychology, have been coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. For example, there was the New Yorker piece from 2010 called “The Truth Wears Off” about the “decline effect,” or how the effect size of a phenomenon appears to decrease over time. . . .


I [Fruehwald] am a linguist. Do the problems facing psychology face me? To really answer that, I first have to decide which explanation for the decline effect I think is most likely, and I think Andrew Gelman’s proposal is a good candidate:

 
The short story is that if you screen for statistical significance when estimating small effects, you will necessarily overestimate the magnitudes of effects, sometimes by a huge amount.
 

I’ve put together some R code to demonstrate this point. Let’s say I’m looking at two populations, and unknown to me as a researcher, there is a small difference between the two, even though they</p><p>3 0.82088619 <a title="898-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-11-How_do_we_evaluate_a_new_and_wacky_claim%3F.html">797 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-11-How do we evaluate a new and wacky claim?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Around these parts we see a continuing flow of unusual claims supported by some statistical evidence.  The claims are varyingly plausible a priori.  Some examples (I won’t bother to supply the links; regular readers will remember these examples and newcomers can find them by searching):
 
- Obesity is contagious 
- People’s names affect where they live, what jobs they take, etc. 
- Beautiful people are more likely to have girl babies 
- More attractive instructors have higher teaching evaluations 
- In a basketball game, it’s better to be behind by a point at halftime than to be ahead by a point 
- Praying for someone without their knowledge improves their recovery from heart attacks 
- A variety of claims about ESP
 
How should we think about these claims?  The usual approach is to evaluate the statistical evidence–in particular, to look for reasons that the claimed results are not really statistically significant.  If nobody can shoot down a claim, it survives.

<p>Introduction: Benedict Carey  writes  a follow-up article on ESP studies and Bayesian statistics.  ( See here  for my previous thoughts on the topic.)  Everything Carey writes is fine, and he even uses an example I recommended:
  
The statistical approach that has dominated the social sciences for almost a century is called significance testing. The idea is straightforward. A finding from any well-designed study — say, a correlation between a personality trait and the risk of depression — is considered “significant” if its probability of occurring by chance is less than 5 percent.


This arbitrary cutoff makes sense when the effect being studied is a large one — for example, when measuring the so-called Stroop effect. This effect predicts that naming the color of a word is faster and more accurate when the word and color match (“red” in red letters) than when they do not (“red” in blue letters), and is very strong in almost everyone.

<p>Introduction: In the discussion of the  fourteen magic words that can increase voter turnout by over 10 percentage points , questions were raised about the methods used to estimate the experimental effects.  I sent these on to Chris Bryan, the author of the study, and he gave the following response:
  
We’re happy to address the questions that have come up. It’s always noteworthy when a precise psychological manipulation like this one generates a large effect on a meaningful outcome. Such findings illustrate the power of the underlying psychological process.


I’ve provided the contingency tables for the two turnout experiments below. As indicated in the paper, the data are analyzed using logistic regressions. The change in chi-squared statistic represents the significance of the noun vs. verb condition variable in predicting turnout; that is, the change in the model’s significance when the condition variable is added. This is a standard way to analyze dichotomous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.
 
2.  A year after I graduated, the landlord actually did sell the place but then, when my friends moved out, he refused to pay back their security deposit.  There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.  So they sued the landlord in Mass. housing court</p><p>3 0.92673111 <a title="898-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-09-Varying_treatment_effects%2C_again.html">1310 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-09-Varying treatment effects, again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This time  from  Bernard Fraga and Eitan Hersh.  Once you think about it, it’s hard to imagine any nonzero treatment effects that don’t vary.  I’m glad to see this area of research becoming more prominent.  ( Here ‘s a discussion of another political science example, also of voter turnout, from a few years ago, from Avi Feller and Chris Holmes.)

<p>Introduction: I received the following message from “Patricia Lopez” of “Premium Link Ads”:
  
Hello,

The best way to reach me is through a direct response to this email. This will help me get back to you about the right link request. Please let me know if you are interested, and if not thanks for your time. Thanks.
  
Usually I just ignore these, but after our recent  discussion  I decided to reply.  I wrote:
  
How much do you pay?
  
But no answer.  I wonder what’s going on?  I mean, why bother sending the email in the first place if you’re not going to follow up?</p><p>5 0.91597706 <a title="898-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-01-Halloween-Valentine%E2%80%99s_update.html">1357 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-01-Halloween-Valentine’s update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago we  reported  on a claim that more babies are born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween.
 
At the time, I wrote that I’d like to see a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns.
 
Joshua Gans sent along the following from an unpublished appendix to his paper.  It’s not the graph I was asking for but it does supply additional information beyond those two holidays.  Click to enlarge:
 
   
 
   
 
I don’t know what all those digits are doing (do you really need to know that an estimate is “-70.856″ if its standard error is “10.640″?  I’d think that “-71 +/- 10 would be just fine), but I suppose the careful reader can ignore the numbers and simply read the signs and the stars.  In any case, it’s good to see more data.</p><p>6 0.91427088 <a title="898-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-18-Understanding_posterior_p-values.html">2029 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-18-Understanding posterior p-values</a></p>

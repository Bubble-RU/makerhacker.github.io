<p>Introduction: Suguru Mizunoya writes:
  
When we estimate the number of people from a national sampling survey (such as labor force survey) using sampling weights, don’t we obtain underestimated number of people, if the country’s population is growing and the sampling frame is based on an old census data?  In countries with increasing populations, the probability of inclusion changes over time, but the weights can’t be adjusted frequently because census takes place only once every five or ten years.


I am currently working for UNICEF for a project on estimating number of out-of-school children in developing countries. The project leader is comfortable to use estimates of number of people from DHS and other surveys.  But, I am concerned that we may need to adjust the estimated number of people by the population projection, otherwise the estimates will be underestimated.


I googled around on this issue, but I could not find a right article or paper on this.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Vande Moere points to  this  impressive interactive map from Brandon Martin-Anderson showing the locations of all the residents of the United States and Canada.
 
It says, “The map has 341,817,095 dots – one for each person.”  Not quite . . . I was hoping to zoom into my building (approximately 10 people live on our floor, I say approximately because two of the apartments are split between two floors and I’m not sure how they would assign the residents), but unfortunately our entire block is just a solid mass of black.  Also, they put a few dots in the park and in the river by accident (presumably because the borders of the census blocks were specified only approximately).  But, hey, no algorithm is perfect.
 
 
 
It’s hard to know what to do about this.  The idea of mapping every person is cool, but you’ll always run into trouble displaying densely populated areas.  Smaller dots might work, but then that might depend on the screen being used for display.</p><p>4 0.12240751 <a title="730-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-09-%E2%80%9CMuch_of_the_recent_reported_drop_in_interstate_migration_is_a_statistical_artifact%E2%80%9D.html">404 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-09-“Much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact”</a></p>

I noticed that you have blogged a little about interstate migration trends in the US, and thought  that you might be interested in  a new working paper  of mine (joint with Sam Schulhofer-Wohl from the Minneapolis Fed) which I have attached.


Briefly, we show that much of the recent reported drop in interstate migration is a statistical artifact: The Census Bureau made an undocumented change in its imputation procedures for missing data in 2006, and this change significantly reduced the number of imputed interstate moves. The change in imputation procedures — not any actual change in migration behavior — explains 90 percent of the reported decrease in interstate migration between the 2005 and 2006 Current Population Surveys, and 42 percent of the decrease between 2000 and 2010.

<p>Introduction: In his new book, “What is Your Race?  The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans,” former Census Bureau director Ken Prewitt recommends taking the race question off the decennial census:
 
 
 
He recommends gradual changes, integrating the race and national origin questions while improving both.  In particular, he would replace the main “race” question by a “race or origin” question, with the instruction to “Mark one or more” of the following boxes: “White,” “Black, African Am., or Negro,” “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” and “Some other race or origin.”  Then the next question is to write in “specific race, origin, or enrolled or principal tribe.”
 
Prewitt writes:
 
 
 
His suggestion is to go with these questions in 2020 and 2030, then in 2040 “drop the race question and use only the national origin question.”  He’s also relying on the American Community Survey to gather a lo</p><p>6 0.11528709 <a title="730-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar_update%3A__Additional_research_on_estimating_small_fractions_of_the_population.html">150 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-16-Gaydar update:  Additional research on estimating small fractions of the population</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>3 0.74413943 <a title="730-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-12-God%2C_Guns%2C_and_Gaydar%3A__The_Laws_of_Probability_Push_You_to_Overestimate_Small_Groups.html">142 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-12-God, Guns, and Gaydar:  The Laws of Probability Push You to Overestimate Small Groups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

The Aflac WorkForces Report, a survey of nearly 1,900 benefits decision-makers and more than 6,100 U.S. workers, also indicated 55 percent said they were not very or not at all likely to be diagnosed with a chronic illness, such as heart disease or diabetes.
  
Here are some actual statistics:
  
The American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2012, said 1-in-3 women and 1-in-2 men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, and the National Safety Council, Injury Facts 2011 edition, says more than 38.9 million injuries occur in a year requiring medical treatment.


The American Heart Association, Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics 2012, said 1-in-6 U.S. deaths were caused by coronary heart disease, Tillman said.
  
And some details on the survey:</p><p>5 0.72673547 <a title="730-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-10-Estimation_from_an_out-of-date_census.html">405 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-10-Estimation from an out-of-date census</a></p>

When we estimate the number of people from a national sampling survey (such as labor force survey) using sampling weights, don’t we obtain underestimated number of people, if the country’s population is growing and the sampling frame is based on an old census data?  In countries with increasing populations, the probability of inclusion changes over time, but the weights can’t be adjusted frequently because census takes place only once every five or ten years.


I am currently working for UNICEF for a project on estimating number of out-of-school children in developing countries. The project leader is comfortable to use estimates of number of people from DHS and other surveys.  But, I am concerned that we may need to adjust the estimated number of people by the population projection, otherwise the estimates will be underestimated.


I googled around on this issue, but I could not find a right article or paper on this.

<p>Introduction: Yaming Yu and Xiao-Li Meng  write in  with a cool new idea for improving the efficiency of Gibbs and Metropolis in multilevel models:
  
For a broad class of multilevel models, there exist two well-known competing parameterizations, the centered parameterization (CP) and the non-centered parameterization (NCP), for effective MCMC implementation. Much literature has been devoted to the questions of when to use which and how to compromise between them via partial CP/NCP. This article introduces an alternative strategy for boosting MCMC efficiency via simply interweaving—but not alternating—the two parameterizations. This strategy has the surprising property that failure of both the CP and NCP chains to converge geometrically does not prevent the interweaving algorithm from doing so. It achieves this seemingly magical property by taking advantage of the discordance of the two parameterizations, namely, the sufficiency of CP and the ancillarity of NCP, to substantially reduce the Markovian</p><p>2 0.9063285 <a title="730-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-%E2%80%9CTo_Rethink_Sprawl%2C_Start_With_Offices%E2%80%9D.html">1029 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-“To Rethink Sprawl, Start With Offices”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
  
Just to throw some Richard Florida in the mix:  Back in 1990, I  turned down  a job offer from Bell Labs, larg</p><p>same-blog 3 0.8867929 <a title="730-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-25-Rechecking_the_census.html">730 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-25-Rechecking the census</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sam Roberts  writes :
  
The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>4 0.84468931 <a title="730-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-16-%E2%80%9CFor_individuals_with_wine_training%2C_however%2C_we_find__indications_of_a_positive_relationship_between_price_and_enjoyment%E2%80%9D.html">470 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-16-“For individuals with wine training, however, we find  indications of a positive relationship between price and enjoyment”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this blog post quotes the second line of the abstract of Goldstein et al.’s much ballyhooed 2008 tech report,  Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?  Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings .  
 
The first sentence of the abstract is
  

Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.

  
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the easy target wine snobs make, the popular press has picked up on the first sentence of the tech report.  For example, the  Freakonomics blog/radio entry  of the same name quotes the first line, ignores the qualification, then concludes

<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on.

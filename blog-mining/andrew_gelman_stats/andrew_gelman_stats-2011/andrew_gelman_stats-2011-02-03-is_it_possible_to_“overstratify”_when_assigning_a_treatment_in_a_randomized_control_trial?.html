<p>Introduction: I received the following note from someone who’d like to remain anonymous: 
  
  
I read  your post  on ethics and statistics, and the comments therein, with much interest.


I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?

I’m exploring HLMs and stan, using your book with Jennifer Hill as my field guide to this new territory. I think I have a generally clear grasp on the material, but wanted to be sure I haven’t gone astray. 


The problem in working on involves a multi-nation survey of students, and I’m especially interested in understanding the effects of country, religion, and sex, and the interactions among those factors (using IRT to estimate individual-level ability, then estimating individual, school, and country effects).


Following the basic approach laid out in chapter 13 for such interactions between levels, I think I need to create a matrix of indicator variables for religion and sex. Elsewhere in the book, you recommend against indicator variables in favor of a single index variable.

<p>Introduction: A research psychologist writes in with a question that’s so long that I’ll put my answer first, then put the question itself below the fold.
 
Here’s my reply:
 
As I wrote in my Anova paper and in my book with Jennifer Hill, I do think that multilevel models can completely replace Anova.  At the same time, I think the central idea of Anova should persist in our understanding of these models.  To me the central idea of Anova is not F-tests or p-values or sums of squares, but rather the idea of predicting an outcome based on factors with discrete levels, and understanding these factors using variance components.
 
The continuous or categorical response thing doesn’t really matter so much to me.  I have no problem using a normal linear model for continuous outcomes (perhaps suitably transformed) and a logistic model for binary outcomes.
 
I don’t want to throw away interactions just because they’re not statistically significant.

<p>Introduction: Last year  we discussed  an important challenge in causal inference:  The standard advice (given in many books, including ours) for causal inference is to control for relevant pre-treatment variables as much as possible.  But, as Judea Pearl has pointed out, instruments (as in “instrumental variables”) are pre-treatment variables that we would  not  want to “control for” in a matching or regression sense.
 
At first, this seems like a minor modification, with the new recommendation being to apply instrumental variables estimation using all pre-treatment instruments, and to control for all other pre-treatment variables.  But that can’t really work as general advice.  What about weak instruments or covariates that have some instrumental aspects?
 
I asked Paul Rosenbaum for his thoughts on the matter, and he wrote the following:
  
In section 18.2 of Design of Observational Studies (DOS), I [Rosenbaum] discuss “seemingly innocuous confounding” defined to be a covariate that predicts a su</p><p>3 0.77152336 <a title="553-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-04-What_are_the_key_assumptions_of_linear_regression%3F.html">1967 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-04-What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a></p>

A link to an  article , “Four Assumptions Of Multiple Regression That Researchers Should Always Test”, has been making  the rounds  on Twitter.  Their first rule is “Variables are Normally distributed.”  And they seem to be talking about the independent variables – but then later bring in tests on the residuals (while admitting that the normally-distributed error assumption is a weak assumption).  


I thought we had long-since moved away from transforming our independent variables to make them normally distributed for statistical reasons (as opposed to standardizing them for interpretability, etc.)  Am I missing something?  I agree that leverage in a influence is important, but normality of the variables? The article is from 2002, so it might be dated, but given the popularity of the tweet, I thought I’d ask your opinion.

Footnote 39 (page 51) informs that they’ve employed seemingly unrelated regression and panel-corrected standard errors, and that to double-check they’ve also run ordinary least squares and fixed-effects panel regressions—all with similar results.


So far, so good. However, the footnote goes on to explain that “Some of the results (e.g. the causal relationship between consolidation and inequality) may be subject to endogeneity and should be interpreted with caution”. (Italics are mine).


Therefore, it seems that the crux of the exercise—i.e. estimating the relationship between fiscal con</p><p>6 0.74914235 <a title="553-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-14-%E2%80%9CToo_much_data%E2%80%9D%3F.html">86 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-14-“Too much data”?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: William Perkins, Mark Tygert, and Rachel Ward  write :
  
If a discrete probability distribution in a model being tested for goodness-of-fit is not close to uniform, then forming the Pearson χ2 statistic can involve division by nearly zero. This often leads to serious trouble in practice — even in the absence of round-off errors . . .
  
The problem is not merely that the chi-squared  statistic  doesn’t have the advertised chi-squared  distribution —a reference distribution can always be computed via simulation, either using the posterior predictive distribution or by conditioning on a point estimate of the cell expectations and then making a degrees-of-freedom sort of adjustment.
 
Rather, the problem is that, when there are lots of cells with near-zero expectation, the chi-squared test is mostly noise.
 
And this is not merely a theoretical problem.  It comes up in real examples.
 
Here’s one, taken from the classic 1992 genetics paper of Guo and Thomspson:

<p>Introduction: I have an optimization problem:  I have a complicated physical model that predicts energy and thermal behavior of a building, given the values of a slew of parameters, such as insulation effectiveness, window transmissivity, etc.  I’m trying to find the parameter set that best fits several weeks of thermal and energy use data from the real building that we modeled. (Of course I would rather explore parameter space and come up with probability distributions for the parameters, and maybe that will come later, but for now I’m just optimizing).  To do the optimization, colleagues and I implemented a “particle swarm optimization” algorithm on a massively parallel machine. This involves giving each of about 120 “particles” an initial position in parameter space, then letting them move around, trying to move to better positions according to a specific algorithm.  We gave each particle an initial position sampled from our prior distribution for each parameter.  So far we’ve run about 140 itera</p><p>4 0.94530928 <a title="553-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-31-Meanwhile%2C_on_the_sister_blog_._._..html">882 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-31-Meanwhile, on the sister blog . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

</p><p>11 From this, I am trained to conclude that this person is abnormal (95% probability). [sent-18, score-0.63]

As an interested reader of your blog, I wondered if you might consider a blog entry sometime on the following  question  I posed on CrossValidated (StackExchange).


I originally posed the question based on my uncertainty about 95% CIs: “Are all values within the 95% CI equally likely (probable), or are the values at the “tails” of the 95% CI less likely than those in the middle of the CI closer to the point estimate?”


I posed this question based on discordant information I found at a couple of different web sources (I posted these sources in the body of the question).


I received some interesting replies, and the replies were not unanimous, in fact there is some serious disagreement there! After seeing this disagreement, I naturally thought of you, and whether you might be able to clear this up.


Please note I am not referring to credible intervals, but rather to the common medical journal reporting standard of confidence intervals.

I have some questions about some basic statistical ideas and would like your opinion on them:


1) Parameters that manifestly DON’T exist:


It makes good sense to me to think about Bayesian statistics as narrowing in on the value of parameters based on a model and some data. But there are cases where “the parameter” simply doesn’t make sense as an actual thing. Yet, it’s not really a complete fiction, like unicorns either, it’s some kind of “effective” thing maybe.


Here’s an example of what I mean. I did a simple toy experiment where we dropped crumpled up balls of paper and timed their fall times. (see here: http://models.street-artists.org/?s=falling+ball ) It was pretty instructive actually, and I did it to figure out how to in a practical way use an ODE to get a likelihood in MCMC procedures. One of the parameters in the model is the radius of the spherical ball of paper. But the ball of paper isn’t a sphere, not even approximately.

<p>Introduction: From  my new article  in the journal Epidemiology:
  
Sander Greenland and Charles Poole accept that P values are here to stay but recognize that some of their most common interpretations have problems. The casual view of the P value as posterior probability of the truth of the null hypothesis is false and not even close to valid under any reasonable model, yet this misunderstanding persists even in high-stakes settings (as discussed, for example, by Greenland in 2011). The formal view of the P value as a probability conditional on the null is mathematically correct but typically irrelevant to research goals (hence, the popularity of alternative—if wrong—interpretations). A Bayesian interpretation based on a spike-and-slab model makes little sense in applied contexts in epidemiology, political science, and other fields in which true effects are typically nonzero and bounded (thus violating both the “spike” and the “slab” parts of the model).

<p>Introduction: This post was written by Phil.
 
A medical company is testing a cancer drug. They get a 16 genetically identical (or nearly identical) rats that all have the same kind of tumor, give 8 of them the drug and leave 8 untreated…or maybe they give them a placebo, I don’t know; is there a placebo effect in rats?.  Anyway, after a while the rats are killed and examined. If the tumors in the treated rats are smaller than the tumors in the untreated rats, then all of the rats have their blood tested for dozens of different proteins that are known to be associated with tumor growth or suppression.  If there is a “significant” difference in one of the protein levels, then the working assumption is that the drug increases or decreases levels of that protein and that may be the mechanism by which the drug affects cancer. All of the above is done on many different cancer types and possibly several different types of rats.  It’s just the initial screening: if things look promising, many more tests an</p><p>3 0.73617387 <a title="923-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation_to_check_missing-data_imputation.html">1330 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation to check missing-data imputation</a></p>

I have questions regarding one technique you and your colleagues described in your papers: the cross validation (Multiple Imputation with Diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening Windows into the Black Box, with reference to Gelman, King, and Liu, 1998). I think this is the technique I need for my purpose, but I am not sure I understand it right. I want to use the multiple imputation to estimate the outcome of psychotherapies based on longitudinal data. First I have to demonstrate that I am able to get unbiased estimates with the multiple imputation. The expected bias is the overestimation of the outcome of dropouts.


I will test my imputation strategies by means of a series of simulations (delete values, impute, compare with the original). Due to the complexity of the statistical analyses I think I need at least 200 cases. Now I don’t have so many cases without any missings. My data have missing values in different variables.

I have measured total phosphorus, TP, on a number of dialysis patients, and also measured conventional phosphate, Pi. Now P is exchanged with the environment as Pi, so in principle a correlation between TP and Pi could perhaps be expected. I’m really most interested in the fraction of TP which is not Pi, that is TP-Pi. I would also expect that to be positively correlated with Pi. However, looking at the data using a mixed model an insignificant negative correlation is obtained. Then I thought, that since TP-Pi is bound to be small if Pi is large a negative correlation is almost dictated by the math even if the biology would have it otherwise in so far as the the TP-Pi, likely organic P, must someday have been Pi. Hence I thought about correcting the slight negative correlation between TP-Pi and Pi for the expected large negative correlation due to the math – to eventually recover what I came from: a positive correlation.

<p>Introduction: Yesterday we had a spirited  discussion  of the following conditional probability puzzle:
  
“I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”
  
This reminded me of the principle, familiar from  statistics instruction  and the  cognitive psychology  literature, that the best way to teach these sorts of examples is through integers rather than fractions.
 
For example, consider this classic problem:
  
“10% of persons have disease X.  You are tested for the disease and test positive, and the test has 80% accuracy.  What is the probability that you have the disease?”
  
This can be solved directly using conditional probability but it appears to be clearer to do it using integers:

<p>Introduction: Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson  write :
  
Financial crises are staggeringly costly. Only major wars rival them in the burdens they place on public finances. Taxpayers typically transfer enormous resources to banks, their stockholders, and creditors, while public debt explodes and the economy runs below full employment for years. This paper compares how relatively large, developed countries have handled bailouts over time. It analyzes why some have done better than others at containing costs and protecting taxpayers. The paper argues that political variables – the nature of competition within party systems and voting turnout – help explain why some countries do more than others to limit the moral hazards of bailouts.
  
I know next to nothing about this topic, so I’ll just recommend you click through and read the article yourself.  Here’s a bit more:

<p>Introduction: Dan Hopkins sends along  this article :
  
[Hopkins] uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the turnout and election impacts of Spanish-language assistance provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Analyses of two different data sets – the Latino National Survey and California 1998 primary election returns – show that Spanish-language assistance increased turnout for citizens who speak little English. The California results also demonstrate that election procedures an influence outcomes, as support for ending bilingual education dropped markedly in heavily Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with Spanish-language assistance. The California analyses find hints of backlash among non-Hispanic white precincts, but not with the same size or certainty. Small changes in election procedures can influence who votes as well as what wins.
  
Beyond the direct relevance of these results, I find this paper interesting as an example of research that is fundamentally quantitative.

<p>Introduction: Geoffrey Sheean writes: 
  
  
I am having trouble thinking Bayesianly about the so-called ‘normal’ or ‘reference’ values that I am supposed to use in some of the tests I perform. These values are obtained from purportedly healthy people. Setting aside concerns about ascertainment bias, non-parametric distributions, and the like, the values are usually obtained by setting the limits at ± 2SD from the mean. In some cases, supposedly because of a non-normal distribution, the third highest and lowest value observed in the healthy group sets the limits, on the assumption that no more than 2 results (out of 20 samples) are allowed to exceed these values: if there are 3 or more, then the test is assumed to be abnormal and the reference range is said to reflect the 90th percentile. The results are binary – normal, abnormal.


The relevance to the diseased state is this. People who are known unequivocally to have condition X show Y abnormalities in these tests.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  and  Megan McArdle  argue about the economics of landlord/tenant laws in D.C., a topic I know nothing about.  But it did remind me of a few stories . . .
 
1.  In grad school, I shared half of a two-family house with three other students.  At some point, our landlord (who lived in the other half of the house) decided he wanted to sell the place, so he had a real estate agent coming by occasionally to show the house to people.  She was just a flat-out liar (which I guess fits my impression based on screenings of Glengarry Glen Ross).  I could never decide, when I was around and she was lying to a prospective buyer, whether to call her on it.  Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.
 
2.  A year after I graduated, the landlord actually did sell the place but then, when my friends moved out, he refused to pay back their security deposit.  There was some debate about getting the place repainted, I don’t remember the details.  So they sued the landlord in Mass. housing court</p><p>5 0.92394406 <a title="923-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-09-Removing_the_blindfold%3A_visualising_statistical_models.html">265 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-09-Removing the blindfold: visualising statistical models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadley Wickham’s talk  for Monday 13 Sept at noon in the statistics dept:
  
As the volume of data increases, so to does the complexity of our models. Visualisation is a powerful tool for both understanding how models work, and what they say about a particularly dataset. There are very many well-known techniques for visualising data, but far fewer for visualising models. In this talk I [Wichkam] will discuss three broad strategies for model visualisation: display the model in the data space; look all members of a collection; and explore the process of model fitting, not just the end result. I will demonstrate these techniques with two examples: neural networks, and ensembles of linear 
models.

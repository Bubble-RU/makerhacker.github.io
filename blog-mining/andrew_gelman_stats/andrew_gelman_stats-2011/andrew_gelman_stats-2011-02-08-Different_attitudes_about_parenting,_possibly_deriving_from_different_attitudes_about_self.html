</p><p>2 Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel. [sent-2, score-0.283]
</p><p>3 Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes). [sent-3, score-0.499]
</p><p>4 My story is that attitudes toward parenting are to some extent derived from attitudes about one’s own experiences as a child. [sent-6, score-0.338]
</p><p>5 They are appreciative of their middle-class backgrounds to the extent that these backgrounds gave them the foundation and opportunity to do what they love, and doing what they love has given them satisfaction and success. [sent-9, score-0.278]
</p><p>6 I also wasn’t naturally skeptical and questioning; I just wanted to write down everything the professor said and memorize it. [sent-27, score-0.133]
</p><p>7 And, again, given Chua’s life as she perceives it, much of her happiness and success derives from her parents’ pushing her in directions that are not her natural inclination. [sent-32, score-0.257]
</p><p>8 Back when I taught at Berkeley and it was considered the #1 statistics department, a lot of my tenured colleagues seemed to have the attitude that their highest achievement in life was becoming a Berkeley statistics professor. [sent-34, score-0.131]
</p><p>9 Also, Cowen and Caplan evidently enjoy their jobs in large part because they enjoy their colleagues, which is much different than Chua’s remark that she doesn’t love the law and that, around her law school colleagues, her “brain turned to sludge. [sent-39, score-0.298]
</p><p>10 ”  As self-made men, in some sense, Cowen and Caplan naturally have less sympathy for the idea that parents can or should mold children, and given their career paths they have no particular affinity for a plan to send a child down a rigid road to a conventional success story. [sent-40, score-0.315]
</p><p>11 I’m saying they have different self-images and different experiences, and in particular I think Chua’s attitudes make much more sense in the context of her life (of course) than they do in the abstract (or as general advice to the would-be tiger moms out there). [sent-42, score-0.181]
</p><p>12 I was more equanimous, taking the position that, sure, I wouldn’t call my kids “garbage” and, sure, it’s a bit weird to not let your kid go to the bathroom, but considering all the child abuse out there, it’s really not so bad. [sent-44, score-0.165]
</p><p>13 Everyone has their own view on this sort of thing, but, personally, I’d rather be called garbage than be whacked. [sent-45, score-0.127]
</p><p>14 Even though I couldn’t bring myself to disapprove of Chua’s parenting style, I did find her persona a bit irritating. [sent-49, score-0.187]
</p><p>15 I would certainly not criticize someone in general terms for yelling at her kids but I don’t enjoy seeing it as a point of pride. [sent-55, score-0.138]
</p><p>16 (From the opposite direction, I was annoyed at people who criticized Chua for encouraging her kids to play piano and violin, given the extremely low probability of success if you go into these fields professionally. [sent-58, score-0.403]
</p><p>17 The idea is that if you learn to play piano or violin, even if you become a celebrated prodigy, even then it’s not a good idea to do it professionally. [sent-60, score-0.153]
</p><p>18 As Charles Rosen wrote, the only good reason to be a professional musician is if you love to play music all the time. [sent-64, score-0.131]
</p><p>19 But the fuller justification is that I think people are, all the time, arguing this or that without reflecting on how this derives from their personal perspectives. [sent-71, score-0.144]
</p><p>20 Caplan responds  (to the parenting stuff, not the spell-checker query). [sent-83, score-0.187]

<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about that Yale professor who wrote that book,  remember , she screamed at her daughters all the time and didn’t let them go the bathroom while they were practicing piano (violin?), Asian parenting-style etc etc.
 
I was just wondering . . . what if she’d had sons rather than daughters?  What are the rules?  Would bringing up boys be the job of mellow white dad rather than intense Asian mom?  If mom were still in charge, would the boys be doing piano, or something else like hockey?  Tiger Mom seems to be into traditional values so I’m assuming she’d want her kids doing something sex-stereotyped?  But sports would be tough, her (hypothetical) boys would have to compete with big strong athletes and would be less likely to be winners so then she couldn’t brag about her amazing parenting skills.
 
I really don’t know the answer to this one.  Maybe some of our readers who are Yale law professors can enlighten us?</p><p>3 0.10729375 <a title="564-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-16-Is_parenting_a_form_of_addiction%3F.html">416 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-16-Is parenting a form of addiction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The last time we encountered Slate columnist Shankar Vedantam was when he  puzzled over  why slightly more than half of voters planned to vote for Republican candidates, given that polls show that Americans dislike the Republican Party even more than they dislike the Democrats.  Vedantam attributed the new Republican majority to irrationality and “unconscious bias.”  But, actually, this voting behavior is perfectly consistent with there being some moderate voters who prefer divided government.  The simple, direct explanation (which Vedantam mistakenly dismisses) actually works fine.
 
I was flipping through Slate today and noticed a  new article  by Vedantam headlined, “If parenthood sucks, why do we love it? Because we’re addicted.”  I don’t like this one either.
  

 
Vedantam starts by reviewing the evidence that people with kids are less happy than people without kids and that parents report that they are unhappy when they are around their young children.  Given this, Vedantam asks</p><p>4 0.093495518 <a title="564-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-Advice_to_help_the_rich_get_richer.html">8 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-Advice to help the rich get richer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  reviews  a recent book, “Lifecyle Investing,” by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff, two professors of management at Yale.  The book recommends that young adults take out loans to buy stocks and then hold these stocks for many years to prepare for retirement.
 
What I’m wondering is:  What’s the goal of writing this sort of book?  The main audience has got to be young adults (and their parents) who are already pretty well fixed, financially.  Students at Yale, for example.  And the book must be intended for people who are already beyond the standard recommendations of personal-investment books (pay off your credit card debt, don’t waste so much money on restaurant meals and fancy clothes, buy 1 used car instead of 2 new ones, etc).  Basically it sounds like they’re talking to people who have a lot of money but want to make sure that they retire rich rather than merely middle-class.
 
I can’t say that I’m morally opposed to helping the rich get richer.

<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>6 0.084700674 <a title="564-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-23-My_Wall_Street_Journal_story.html">532 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-23-My Wall Street Journal story</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The only thing is, I’m not sure who’s David here and who is Goliath.  From the standpoint of book sales, Gladwell is Goliath for sure.  On the other hand, Gladwell’s credibility has been weakened over the years by fights with bigshots such as Steven Pinker.  Maybe the best analogy is a boxing match where Gladwell stands in the ring and fighter after fighter is sent in to bang him up.  At some point the heavyweight gets a little bit tired. (Recently Gladwell had a New Yorker column defending dopers such as Lance Armstrong, so I suspect he’ll have Kaiser Fung  coming  after him  again , once the current lucha with Chabris is over.)
 
Chabris took his swing at Gladwell a few days ago, as I reported  here .
 
Yesterday was Gladwell’s  turn .  I have a lot of sympathy for the Blink-man here:  he writes these bestsellers and puts himself out there, so he’s a target.  If Gladwell’s books were generic business-bestseller pap of the be-yourself-and-be-tough variety, he wouldn’t get hassled.

<p>Introduction: Daniel Mendelsohn recently  asked , “Why do we love the Titanic?”, seeking to understand how it has happened that: 
  
  
It may not be true that ‘the three most written-about subjects of all time are Jesus, the Civil War, and the Titanic,’ as one historian has put it, but it’s not much of an exaggeration. . . . The inexhaustible interest suggests that the Titanic’s story taps a vein much deeper than the morbid fascination that has attached to other disasters. The explosion of the Hindenburg, for instance, and even the torpedoing, just three years after the Titanic sank, of the Lusitania, another great liner whose passenger list boasted the rich and the famous, were calamities that shocked the world but have failed to generate an obsessive preoccupation. . . . 


If the Titanic has gripped our imagination so forcefully for the past century, it must be because of something bigger than any fact of social or political or cultural history.

<p>Introduction: When linking to my  review  of Duncan Watts’s book in a recent post, I came across some fun bits that I’d like to share (for those of you who didn’t just click through and read the whole thing):
 
On business books:
  
I’m not so interested in the business angle but I suppose that’s how you sell books these days. The business part of the book was ok—I’m not saying it was filler—it’s just that I’m not particularly interested in which format of videocassette wins, or whether Cisco Systems is a well-run company. I realize that a lot of people care about this sort of things nowadays, but I’d rather talk about sports or politics.
  
On dodgy science writer John Gribbin:
  
Sure, people write all sorts of silly things but usually they have some sort of political or religious excuse for why it’s ok to believe them. Truth is not the only important value in life, there are also other concerns such as political convictions, religious beliefs, and the simple desire to avoid offending people.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Swartz  writes  the following, as a lead-in to an argument in favor of vegetarianism:
  
 
Imagine you were an early settler of what is now the United States. It seems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your parents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed them, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed them. Chances are, you would have killed them too . . .


Or if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the example of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn’t think too much about the morality of it. . . .
 

 
Are these statements true, though?  It’s hard for me to believe that most early settlers (from the context, it looks like Swartz is discussing the 1500s-1700s here) killed native Americans.  That is, if N is the number of early settlers, and Y is the number of these settlers who killed at least one Indian, I suspect Y/N is much closer to 0 than to 1.  Similarly, it’s not even cl</p><p>6 0.83175123 <a title="564-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-27-%E2%80%9CThe_ultimate_left-wing_novel%E2%80%9D.html">682 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-27-“The ultimate left-wing novel”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>2 0.98580801 <a title="564-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-08-Animated_drought_maps.html">1487 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-08-Animated drought maps</a></p>

I’m not so happy with the arrangement of years by decade—the lineup of all years ending in 0, or 1, or 2, etc., seems a bit of a distraction—but in many ways the display is impressive.  And, as often is the case with such graphs, once it’s out there, other people can do similar things and make their own improvements.</p><p>3 0.98500288 <a title="564-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation_to_check_missing-data_imputation.html">1330 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-19-Cross-validation to check missing-data imputation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aureliano Crameri writes: 
  
  
I have questions regarding one technique you and your colleagues described in your papers: the cross validation (Multiple Imputation with Diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening Windows into the Black Box, with reference to Gelman, King, and Liu, 1998). I think this is the technique I need for my purpose, but I am not sure I understand it right. I want to use the multiple imputation to estimate the outcome of psychotherapies based on longitudinal data. First I have to demonstrate that I am able to get unbiased estimates with the multiple imputation. The expected bias is the overestimation of the outcome of dropouts.


I will test my imputation strategies by means of a series of simulations (delete values, impute, compare with the original). Due to the complexity of the statistical analyses I think I need at least 200 cases. Now I don’t have so many cases without any missings. My data have missing values in different variables. The proportion of missing values is</p><p>4 0.98322225 <a title="564-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-24-Always_check_your_evidence.html">1025 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-24-Always check your evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Logical reasoning typically takes the following form:
 
1.  I know that A is true. 
2.  I know that A implies B. 
3.  Therefore, I can conclude that B is true.
 
I, like Lewis Carroll, have  problems  with this process sometimes, but it’s pretty standard.
 
There is also a statistical version in which the above statements are replaced by averages (“A usually happens,” etc.).
 
But in all these stories, the argument can fall down if you get the facts wrong.  Perhaps that’s one reason that statisticians can be obsessed with detail. 
   
For example, David Brooks wrote the following, in a  column  called “Living with Mistakes”:
  
The historian Leslie Hannah identified the ten largest American companies in 1912. None of those companies ranked in the top 100 companies by 1990.
  
Huh?  Could that really be?  I googled “ten largest american companies 1912″ and found  this , from Leslie Hannah:
 
  
 
No big deal:  two still in the top 10 rather than zero in the top 100, but Brooks’s general</p><p>5 0.98315179 <a title="564-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-A_graphics_talk_with_no_visuals%21.html">1598 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-A graphics talk with no visuals!</a></p>

They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.

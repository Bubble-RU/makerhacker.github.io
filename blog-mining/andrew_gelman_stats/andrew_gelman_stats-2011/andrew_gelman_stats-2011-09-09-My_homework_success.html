You will be amused to know that students in our Bayesian Inference paper at 4th year found solutions to exercises from your book on-line.  The amazing thing was that some of them were dumb enough to copy out solutions verbatim.   However, I thought you might like to know you have done well in this class!
  
Iâ&euro;&trade;m happy to hear this.

<p>Introduction: Here are  solutions to about 50 of the exercises from Bayesian Data Analysis.  The solutions themselves haven’t been updated; I just cleaned up the file:  some change in Latex had resulted in much of the computer code running off the page, so I went in and cleaned up the files.
 
I wrote most of these in 1996, and I like them a lot.  I think several of them would’ve made good journal articles, and in retrospect I wish I’d published them as such.  Original material that appears first in a book (or, even worse, in homework solutions) can easily be overlooked.</p><p>3 0.3389065 <a title="896-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-19-Sorry%2C_no_ARM_solutions.html">1220 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-19-Sorry, no ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Gerlanc asks:
  
I’ve been reading your Regression and Multilevel Modeling book. Do you have a set of example solutions for the problems in the book?
  
Henning Piezunka, Adam Lynton, and others have asked the same question.
 
My universal response:
 
I’m glad you like our book.  Unfortunately, we have no solution sets.  I made a bunch of solutions for my earlier book but it was so much work that I decided not to do it a second time!</p><p>4 0.30868047 <a title="896-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-ARM_solutions.html">240 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-ARM solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People sometimes email asking if a solution set is available for the exercises in ARM.  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Many years ago, I wrote up 50 solutions for BDA and it was a lot of work–really, it was like writing a small book in itself.  The trouble is that, once I started writing them up, I wanted to do it right, to set a good example.  That’s a lot more effort than simply scrawling down some quick answers.</p><p>5 0.17033447 <a title="896-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-15-Gay-married_state_senator_shot_down_gay_marriage.html">613 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-15-Gay-married state senator shot down gay marriage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: A neuroeconomist asks::
  
Is there any literature on the Bayesian approach to simultaneous equation systems that you could suggest? (Think demand/supply in econ).
  
My reply:  Iâ&euro;&trade;m not up-to-date on the Bayesian econometrics literature.  TTony Lancaster came out with a book a few years ago that might have some of these models.  Maybe you, the commenters, have some suggestions?  Measurement-error models are inherently Bayesian, seeing as they have all these latent parameters, so it seems like there should be a lot out there.</p><p>5 0.66913521 <a title="896-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-05-A_locally_organized_online_BDA_course_on_G%2B_hangout%3F.html">2009 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-05-A locally organized online BDA course on G+ hangout?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eoin Lawless wrote me:
  
I’ve been reading your blog (and  John Kruschke ‘s) for several months now, as a result of starting to learn Bayesian methods from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis [I love the title of that book! --- ed.]. More recently I completed a Coursera course on Data Science. 


I found learning through the medium of a online course to be an amazing experience. It does not replace books, but learning new material at the same time as other people and discussing it in the forums is very motivational. Additionally it is much easier to work through exercises and projects when there is a deadline and some element of competition than to plow through the end of chapter exercises in a book. This is especially true, I believe, when the learning is for a long term goal, rather than to be used immediately in work, for example.

<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.
 
P.S.  Overall the article is pretty good.

<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

<p>Introduction: Philip Cohen  asks , “Why are mothers becoming moms?”  These aren’t just two words for the same thing:  in political terms “mother” is merely descriptive while “mom” is more positive.  Indeed, we speak of “mom and apple pie” as unquestionable American icons.
 
Cohen points out that motherhood is sometimes but not always respected in political discourse:
  
On the one hand, both President Obama and pundit Hilary Rosen have now called motherhood the world’s hardest job. And with the Romneys flopping onto the all-mothers-work bandwagon, it appears we’re reaching a rare rhetorical consensus.


On the other hand, the majority in both major political parties agrees that poor single mothers and their children need one thing above all – a (real) job, one that provides the “dignity of an honest day’s work.” For welfare purposes, taking care of children is not only not the toughest job in the world, it is more akin to nothing at all. When Bill Clinton’s endorsed welfare-to-work he famously decla</p><p>5 0.9620167 <a title="896-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-04-Too_many_MC%E2%80%99s_not_enough_MIC%E2%80%99s%2C_or_What_principles_should_govern_attempts_to_summarize_bivariate_associations_in_large_multivariate_datasets%3F.html">1706 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-04-Too many MC’s not enough MIC’s, or What principles should govern attempts to summarize bivariate associations in large multivariate datasets?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Justin Kinney writes:
  
Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

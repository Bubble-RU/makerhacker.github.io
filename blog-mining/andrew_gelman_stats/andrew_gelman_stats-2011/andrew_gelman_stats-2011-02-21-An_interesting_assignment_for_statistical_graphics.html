<p>Introduction: By now you all must be tired of my one-sided presentations of the differences between infovis and statgraphics (for example,  this article  with Antony Unwin).
 
Today is something different.  Courtesy of Martin Theus, editor of the Statistical Computing and Graphics Newsletter, we have two short articles offering competing perspectives:
 
Robert Kosara writes from an Infovis view:
  
Information visualization is a field that has had trouble defining its boundaries, and that consequently is often misunderstood. It doesn’t help that InfoVis, as it is also known, produces pretty pictures that people like to look at and link to or send around. But InfoVis is more than pretty pictures, and it is more than statistical graphics.


The key to understanding InfoVis is to ignore the images for a moment and focus on the part that is often lost: interaction. When we use visualization tools, we don’t just create one image or one kind of visualization. In fact, most people would argue that there is</p><p>6 0.15335588 <a title="583-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-25-A_statistical_graphics_course_and_statistical_graphics_advice.html">2266 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-25-A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joshua Vogelstein points us to  an article  by Shaaron Ainsworth, Vaughan Prain, and Russell Tytler:
  
Should science learners be challenged to draw more? Certainly making visualizations is integral to scientific thinking. Scientists do not use words only but rely on diagrams, graphs, videos, photographs, and other images to make discoveries, explain findings, and excite public interest. . . . However, in the science classroom, learners mainly focus on interpreting others’ visualizations; when drawing does occur, it is rare that learners are systematically encouraged to create their own visual forms to develop and show understanding (6). Drawing includes constructing a line graph from a table of values, sketching cells observed through a microscope, or inventing a way to show a scientific phenomenon (e.g., evaporation). Although interpretation of visualizations and other information is clearly critical to learning, becoming proficient in science also requires learners to develop many</p><p>3 0.71276355 <a title="583-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-25-A_statistical_graphics_course_and_statistical_graphics_advice.html">2266 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-25-A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .

<p>Introduction: Every once in awhile I get a question that I can directly answer from my published research.  When that happens it makes me so happy.
 
Here’s an example.  Patrick Lam wrote,
  
Suppose one develops a Bayesian model to estimate a parameter theta.  Now suppose one wants to evaluate the model via simulation by generating fake data where you know the value of theta and see how well you recover theta with your model, assuming that you use the posterior mean as the estimate.  The traditional frequentist way of evaluating it might be to generate many datasets and see how well your estimator performs each time in terms of unbiasedness or mean squared error or something.  But given that unbiasedness means nothing to a Bayesian and there is no repeated sampling interpretation in a Bayesian model, how would you suggest one would evaluate a Bayesian model?
  
My reply:
  
I actually have  a paper on this !  It is by Cook, Gelman, and Rubin.  The idea is to draw theta from the prior distribution.</p><p>2 0.97962642 <a title="583-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Thinking_outside_the_%28graphical%29_box%3A__Instead_of_arguing_about_how_best_to_fix_a_bar_chart%2C_graph_it_as_a_time_series_lineplot_instead.html">294 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Thinking outside the (graphical) box:  Instead of arguing about how best to fix a bar chart, graph it as a time series lineplot instead</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

<p>Introduction: Antony Unwin writes:
  
I [Unwin] find it an interesting exercise for students to ask them to write headlines (and subheadlines) for graphics, both for ones they have drawn themselves and for published ones.  The results are sometimes depressing, often thought-provoking and occasionally highly entertaining.
  
This seems like a great idea, both for teaching students how to read a graph and also for teaching how to make a graph.  I’ve long said that when making a graph (or, for that matter, a table), you want to think about what message the reader will get out of it. “Displaying a bunch of numbers” doesn’t cut it.</p><p>4 0.97262764 <a title="583-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-20-Andy_vs._the_Ideal_Point_Model_of_Voting.html">355 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-20-Andy vs. the Ideal Point Model of Voting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression   
book (p. 317), using the U.S. Senate instead of the Supreme Court, and

<p>Introduction: Pablo Verde sends in  this letter  he and Daniel Curcio just published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. They had published a meta-analysis with a boundary estimate which, he said, gave nonsense results.  Here’s Curcio and Verde’s key paragraph:
  
The authors [of the study they are criticizing] performed a test of heterogeneity between studies. Given that the test result was not significant at 5%, they decided to pool all the RRs by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in meta-analysis, which usually leads to very misleading results. First of all, the pooled RR as well as its standard	error are sensitive to 2 the estimation of the between-studies standard deviation (SD).	SD is difficult to estimate with a small number of studies. On the other hand, it is very well known that the significant test of hetero- geneity lacks statistical power to detect values of SD greater than zero. In addition, the statistically non-significant re</p><p>6 0.96976542 <a title="583-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-31-Response_by_Jessica_Tracy_and_Alec_Beall_to_my_critique_of_the_methods_in_their_paper%2C_%E2%80%9CWomen_Are_More_Likely_to_Wear_Red_or_Pink_at_Peak_Fertility%E2%80%9D.html">1963 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-31-Response by Jessica Tracy and Alec Beall to my critique of the methods in their paper, “Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Inti Pedroso writes:
  
Today during the group meeting at my new job we were revising a paper whose main conclusions were sustained by an ANOVA.


One of the first observations is that the experiment had a small sample size. Interestingly (may not so), some of the reported effects (most of them interactions) were quite large. One of the experience group members said that “there is a common wisdom that one should not believe effects from small sample sizes but [he thinks] if they [the effects] are large enough to be picked on a small study they must be real large effects”. I argued that if the sample size is small one could incur on a M-type error in which the magnitude of the effect is being over-estimated and that if larger samples are evaluated the magnitude may become smaller and also the confidence intervals. The concept of M-type error is completely new to all other members of the group (on which I am in my second week) and I was given the job of finding a suitable ref to explain</p><p>5 0.14257419 <a title="695-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-25-Design_of_nonrandomized_cluster_sample_study.html">820 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-25-Design of nonrandomized cluster sample study</a></p>

My response:
 
You can generalize the results even if you didn’t randomly sample the health facilities.  The only thing is that your generalization applies to the implicit population of facilities to which your sample is representative.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan sends me  this article  from the research-methods all-star team of Katherine Button, John Ioannidis, Claire Mokrysz,  Brian Nosek , Jonathan Flint, Emma Robinson, and Marcus Munafo:
  
A study with low statistical power has a reduced chance of detecting a true effect, but it is less well appreciated that low power also reduces the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect. Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but often ignored methodological principles.
  
I agree completely.

<p>Introduction: Last month a history professor sent me a note regarding plagiarism at Arizona State University:
  
Matthew Whitaker, who had received an expedited promotion to full professor and was made Director of a new Center for the Study of Race and Democracy by Provost Elizabeth Capaldi and President Michael Crow, was charged by most of the full professors in the History Faculty with having plagiarized throughout his corpus of work, copying from regular works of scholarship and from web sources. Indeed, in his response, which claimed that the petitioners were racist, Whitaker admitted to plagiarism in his work, defending himself in part by stating that he had not reviewed carefully the research and writing he had hired others to do. . . .
  
What bothered my correspondent was that Whitaker remains an ASU Foundation Professor of History despite all the plaig. According to Whitaker’s  webpage , he “is also a highly sought after speaker, having offered commentaries on NPR, PBS, . . . and other medi</p><p>2 0.97262383 <a title="695-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-22-To_Throw_Away_Data%3A_Plagiarism_as_a_Statistical_Crime.html">1867 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-22-To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: A graduate student in public health writes:
  
I have been asked to do the statistical analysis for a medical unit that is delivering a pilot study of a program to [details redacted to prevent identification]. They are using a prospective, nonrandomized, cohort-controlled trial study design.


The investigator thinks they can recruit only a small number of treatment and control cases, maybe less than 30 in total.  After I told the Investigator that I cannot do anything statistically with a sample size that small, he responded that small sample sizes are common in this field, and he send me an example of analysis that someone had done on a similar study.


So he still wants me to come up with a statistical plan. Is it unethical for me to do anything other than descriptive statistics? I think he should just stick to qualitative research. But the study she mentions above has 40 subjects and apparently had enough power to detect some effects. This is a pilot study after all so the n does n</p><p>4 0.96832365 <a title="695-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-23-My_last_post_on_albedo%2C_I_promise.html">625 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-23-My last post on albedo, I promise</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After seeing my recent  blogs  on Nathan Myhrvold, a friend told me that, in the tech world, the albedo-obsessed genius is known as a patent troll.
 
Really?
 
Yup.  My friend writes:
  
 
It’s perhaps indicative that Myhrvold comes up in the top-ten hits on Google for [patent troll]. These blog posts lay it out pretty clearly:

Just about anyone’s that’s been in the tech game thinks patents are ridiculous.  The lab where I used to work wanted us to create an “intellectual mine field” in our field so the companycould block anyone from entering the space.  Yes, we made stuff, but the patents were for totally obvious ideas that anyone would have.

<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>6 0.96669322 <a title="695-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-14-How_the_ignorant_idiots_win%2C_explained.__Maybe..html">765 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-14-How the ignorant idiots win, explained.

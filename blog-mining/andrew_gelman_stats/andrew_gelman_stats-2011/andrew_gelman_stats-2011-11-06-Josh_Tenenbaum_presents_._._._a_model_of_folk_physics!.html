<p>Introduction: As I’ve written before, I was a math and physics major in college but I switched to statistics because math seemed pointless if you weren’t the best (and I knew there were people better than me), and I just didn’t feel like I had a good physical understanding.
 
My lack of physical understanding comes up from time to time.  An example occurred the other day.  I was viewing a demonstration of Foucault’s pendulum and the guide said the period was something like 35 hours.  I was surprised, having always thought it had a 24-hour period.  Sure, I can understand it in words, but, even after reflecting on it for a minute, I couldn’t see my way to even an approximate derivation.  If I wanted to, I think I could go through the math (for example  here ), but I feel that if I really had the intuition, I wouldn’t need to.
 
I’m sure I have a lot more physical understanding than the average person but I don’t think I have enough to be a real physicist.</p><p>3 0.10991991 <a title="994-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-25-Classical_probability_does_not_apply_to_quantum_systems_%28causal_inference_edition%29.html">2037 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-25-Classical probability does not apply to quantum systems (causal inference edition)</a></p>

To viewers of Dr. Andrew Gelman’s blog,


I [Wallsten] am pleased to invite you to participate in an important research project to develop improved methods for predicting future events and outcomes. More specifically, our goal is to develop methods for aggregating many individual judgments in a manner that yields more accurate predictions than any one person or small group alone could provide. Our research is funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity (IARPA,  iarpa.gov ), but its application will extend far beyond intelligence to such areas as business forecasting or medical diagnosis. Our team consists of researchers at ARA, a private company; as well as researchers at the University of Maryland-College Park, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Fordham University, University of California-Irvine, Wake Forest University, and the University of Missouri.

<p>Introduction: Professor of business management Edwin Locke sent me  an article :
  
This paper argues that theory building in the social sciences, management and psychology included, should be inductive. It begins by critiquing contemporary philosophy of science, e.g., Popper’s falsifiability theory, his stress on deduction, and the hypothetico-deductive method. Next I present some history of the concept of induction in philosophy and of inductive theory building in the hard sciences (e.g., Aristotle, Bacon, Newton). This is followed by three examples of successful theory building by induction in psychology and management (Beck’s theory, Bandura’s social-cognitive theory, goal setting theory). The paper concludes with some suggested guidelines for successful theory building through induction and some new policies that journal editors might encourage.

<p>Introduction: Lee Sechrest sends along  this article  by Brian Haig and writes that it “presents what seems to me a useful perspective on much of what scientists/statisticians do and how science works, at least in the fields in which I work.”  Here’s Haig’s abstract: 
  
  
A broad theory of scientific method is sketched that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods that are used in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

I’ve been following  your recent discussions  about how an AI could do statistics [see also  here ].  I was especially excited about your suggestion for new statistical methods using “a language-like approach to recursively creating new models from a specified list of distributions and transformations, and an automatic approach to checking model fit.”


Your discussion of these ideas was exciting to me and my colleagues because we recently  did some work  taking a step in this direction, automatically searching through a grammar over Gaussian process regression models.


Roger Grosse previously  did the same thing , but over matrix decomposition models using held-out predictive likelihood to check model fit.


These are both examples of automatic Bayesian model-building by a search over more and more complex models, as you suggested.  One nice thing is that both grammars include lots of standard models for free, and they seem to work pretty well, although the</p><p>6 0.6977191 <a title="994-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Applying_quantum_probability_to_political_science.html">877 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Applying quantum probability to political science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Josh Tenenbaum describes some new work modeling people’s physical reasoning as probabilistic inferences over intuitive theories of mechanics. 
  
A general-purpose capacity for “physical intelligence”—inferring physical properties of objects and predicting future states in complex dynamical scenes—is central to how humans interpret their environment and plan safe and effective actions.  The computations and representations underlying physical intelligence remain unclear, however. Cognitive studies have focused on mapping out judgment biases and errors, or on testing simple heuristic models suitable only for highly specific cases; they have not attempted to give general-purpose unifying models.  In computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics researchers have long sought to formalize common-sense physical reasoning but without success in approaching human-level competence.  Here we show that a wide range of human physical judgments can be explained by positing an “intuitive me</p><p>2 0.93855023 <a title="994-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-21-Judea_Pearl_on_why_he_is_%E2%80%9Conly_a_half-Bayesian%E2%80%9D.html">1133 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-21-Judea Pearl on why he is “only a half-Bayesian”</a></p>

I [Pearl] turned Bayesian in 1971, as soon as I began reading Savage’s monograph The Foundations of Statistical Inference [Savage, 1962]. The arguments were unassailable: (i) It is plain silly to ignore what we know, (ii) It is natural and useful to cast what we know in the language of probabilities, and (iii) If our subjective probabilities are erroneous, their impact will get washed out in due time, as the number of observations increases.


Thirty years later, I [Pearl] am still a devout Bayesian in the sense of (i), but I now doubt the wisdom of (ii) and I know that, in general, (iii) is false.
  
He elaborates:
  
The bulk of human knowledge is organized around causal, not probabilistic relationships, and the grammar of probability calculus is insufficient for capturing those relationships. Specifically, the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as “mud does not cause rain” and “symptom</p><p>3 0.90216339 <a title="994-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Lindley%E2%80%99s_paradox.html">1355 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Lindley’s paradox</a></p>

I [Seaver] happened to be reading an ironic  article  by Karl Friston when I learned something new about frequentist vs bayesian, namely Lindley’s paradox, on page 12.  The text is as follows:

 
So why are we worried about trivial effects? They are important because the probability that the true effect size is exactly zero is itself zero and could cause us to reject the null hypothesis inappropriately. This is a fallacy of classical inference and is not unrelated to Lindley’s paradox (Lindley 1957). Lindley’s paradox describes a counterintuitive situation in which Bayesian and frequentist approaches to hypothesis testing give opposite results. It occurs when; (i) a result is significant by a frequentist test, indicating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis d=0 and (ii) priors render the posterior probability of d=0 high, indicating strong evidence that the null hypothesis is true.

treatment, Lindley (1957) showed that – under a parti</p><p>4 0.899831 <a title="994-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-31-Type_S_error_rates_for_classical_and_Bayesian_single_and_multiple_comparison_procedures.html">494 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-31-Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian single and multiple comparison procedures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

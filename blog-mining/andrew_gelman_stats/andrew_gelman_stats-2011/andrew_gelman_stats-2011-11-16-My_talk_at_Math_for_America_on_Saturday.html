My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.

<p>Introduction: See below for the job announcement.  It’s for Teachers College, which is about 2 blocks from the statistics department and 2 blocks from the political science department.  So even though I don’t have any official connection with Teachers College (besides occasionally working with them on research projects), I very much would like to have another exciting young applied researcher here, to complement all the people we currently have in stat, poli sci, engineering, etc.  In particular, we have zillions of interesting and important social science research projects going on here, and they all need statistics work.  A lot of social scientists do statistics, but it’s not so easy to find a statistician who does serious social science research.
 
All this is to say that I hope this job gets some applicants from some people who are serious about applied statistics and the development of new models and methods.

<p>Introduction: Anish Thomas writes:
  
 
I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitztein sent around the following graph:
 
 
 
(The x-axis goes from 2000 to 2012 and the y=axis goes from 0 to 120.)
 
100 statistics majors (this combines sophomores, juniors, and seniors, but still, that’s a lot more than the 1 or 2 or 3 a year we’re used to seeing).  At first I was like, whoa!  But then I thought, why  not  100 or even 200 or 300 statistics majors?  Statistics is important in itself, it’s relatively easy as far as quantitative majors go, it’s applicable to lots of other areas.  The real question should be not, What’s been happening that’s made statistics so trendy lately? but rather, What took so long for this to happen, and why isn’t statistics more popular?  Both places where I studied as an undergraduate, statistics was just a subset of the math department, and maybe the only reason I ended up in statistics is that I took a probability course one semester because, at 5pm, it fit my schedule.</p><p>5 0.70497471 <a title="1013-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-19-%E2%80%9CRonald_Reagan_is_a_Statistician_and_Other_Examples_of_Learning_From_Diverse_Sources_of_Information%E2%80%9D.html">1771 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-19-“Ronald Reagan is a Statistician and Other Examples of Learning From Diverse Sources of Information”</a></p>

Statistics—Inside and Outside the Classroom
 
(1)  Of Beauty, Sex, and Power:  Statistical Challenges in the Estimation of Small Effects .  A silly example of the frequencies of boy and girl babies leads us to some important research involving the meaning of statistical significance. 
(2)  Mathematics, Statistics, and Political Science .  We explore the differences between mathematical and statistical thinking, developing the ideas using examples from my own research in political science.

<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>3 0.90668571 <a title="1013-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-29-Data_mining_and_allergies.html">685 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-29-Data mining and allergies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all this data floating around, there are some interesting analyses one can do. I came across  “The Association of Tree Pollen Concentration Peaks and Allergy Medication Sales in New York City: 2003-2008″  by  Perry Sheffield . There they correlate pollen counts with anti-allergy medicine sales – and indeed find that two days after high pollen counts, the medicine sales are the highest.
 
 
 
Of course, it would be interesting to play with the data to see *what* tree is actually causing the sales to increase the most. Perhaps this would help the arborists what trees to plant. At the moment they seem to be following  a rather sexist approach  to tree planting:
  

Ogren says the city could solve the problem by planting only female trees, which don’t produce pollen like male trees do.


City arborists shy away from females because many produce messy – or in the case of ginkgos, smelly – fruit that litters sidewalks.


In Ogren’s opinion, that’s a mistake. He says the females only pro</p><p>4 0.90509999 <a title="1013-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-16-The_lamest%2C_grudgingest%2C_non-retraction_retraction_ever.html">1626 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-16-The lamest, grudgingest, non-retraction retraction ever</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>5 0.87325573 <a title="1013-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-12-Peter_Thiel_is_writing_another_book%21.html">1895 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-12-Peter Thiel is writing another book!</a></p>

“I’m writing this book because we need to think about the future for more than just 140 characters or 15 minutes at a time if we want to make real long-term progress,” Mr. Thiel said in a statement. “’Zero to One’ is about learning from Silicon Valley how to solve hard problems and build great things that have never existed before.”

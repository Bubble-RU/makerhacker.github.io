 An example:  my papers with Basbøll 
 
Thomas Basbøll and I got into a long discussion on our blogs about business school professor Karl Weick and other cases of  plagiarism  copying text without attribution.  We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:   To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime  went into American Scientist and  When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences  will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.

<p>Introduction: Carl Bialik of the Wall Street Journal writes:
  
I’m working on a column this week about numerical/statistical tips and resolutions for writers and people in other fields in the new year. 2013 is the International Year of Statistics, so I’d like to offer some ways to better grapple with statistics in the year ahead. Here’s where you come in. If you have time in the next couple of days, please send me an idea or three about what people often do incorrectly when it comes to numbers, and how they could do better, without making things much more complicated. Maybe with an example of something you’ve seen that rubbed you the wrong way, and how you’d fix it. Bonus if you can tie it in to some sort of statistic that will be particularly relevant in 2013.


Any ideas of yours I use, I’ll credit, of course.


Examples of what I have in mind:

<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.11790091 <a title="532-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.1152602 <a title="532-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-02-Fragment_of_statistical_autobiography.html">390 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-02-Fragment of statistical autobiography</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrew Anthony  tells the excellent story  of how Nick Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman shot down some particularly silly work in psychology.  (“According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.”  And, yes, the work they were shooting down really is that bad.)
 
If you want to see what the fuss is about, just google “2.9013.”   Here’s  an example (from 2012) of an uncritical reporting of the claim,  here’s  another one from 2010,  here’s  one from 2011 . . . well, you get the idea.
 
And  here’s a quick summary  posted by Rolf Zwaan after Brown et al. came out with their paper.
 
I know Sokal and Brown and so this story was not news to me.  I didn’t post anything about it on this blog because it seemed like it was getting enough coverage elsewhere.

<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.
  
I’m lucky enough not to ever have had to bale hay or go door-to-door for a living, but I find writing to be enjoyable!

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.
 
I’m reminded of a bizarrely-retro  remark  from a couple years ago by Colin (“at age 22″) Camerer.  In response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer said:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”

<p>Introduction: Our research assistants have unearthed the following guest column by H. L. Mencken which appeared in the New York Times of 5 Nov 1933, the date at which Prohibition ended in the United States. As a public service we are reprinting it here.
 
I’m particularly impressed at how the Sage of Baltimore buttressed his article with references to the latest scientific literature of the time. I think you’ll all agree that Mencken’s column, in which he took a stand against the legality of alcohol consumption, has  contemporary relevance , more than 80 years later.
 
Because of the challenge of interpreting decades-old references, we have asked a leading scholar of Mencken’s writings to add notes where appropriate, to clarify any points of confusion. And now here’s Mencken’s column (with notes added in brackets), in its entirety:
  
For a little while in my teenage years, my friends and I drank alcohol. It was fun. I have some fond memories of us all being silly together.

<p>Introduction: I was talking with someone the other day about the book by that Yale law professor who called her kids “garbage” and didn’t let them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano . . . apparently it wasn’t so bad as all that, she was  misrepresented  by the Wall Street Journal excerpt:
  
“I was very surprised,” she says. “The Journal basically strung together the most controversial sections of the book. And I had no idea they’d put that kind of a title on it. . . . “And while it’s ultimately my responsibility — my strict Chinese mom told me ‘never blame other people for your problems!’ — the one-sided nature of the excerpt has really led to some major misconceptions about what the book says, and about what I really believe.”
  
I don’t completely follow her reasoning here:  just because, many years ago, her mother told her a slogan about not blaming other people, therefore she can say, “it’s ultimately my responsibility”?  You can see the illogic of this by flipping it around.  Wha</p><p>2 0.9571203 <a title="532-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>3 0.95654166 <a title="532-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project_qualifying_exam_process%3A__An_intensified_dialogue_between_students_and_faculty.html">308 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project qualifying exam process:  An intensified dialogue between students and faculty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>4 0.95304865 <a title="532-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-19-%E2%80%9CThe_British_amateur_who_debunked_the_mathematics_of_happiness%E2%80%9D.html">2177 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-19-“The British amateur who debunked the mathematics of happiness”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andrew Anthony  tells the excellent story  of how Nick Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman shot down some particularly silly work in psychology.  (“According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.”  And, yes, the work they were shooting down really is that bad.)
 
If you want to see what the fuss is about, just google “2.9013.”   Here’s  an example (from 2012) of an uncritical reporting of the claim,  here’s  another one from 2010,  here’s  one from 2011 . . . well, you get the idea.
 
And  here’s a quick summary  posted by Rolf Zwaan after Brown et al. came out with their paper.
 
I know Sokal and Brown and so this story was not news to me.  I didn’t post anything about it on this blog because it seemed like it was getting enough coverage elsewhere.

<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>6 0.95091909 <a title="532-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-09-Experimental_work_on_market-based_or_non-market-based_incentives.html">1410 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-09-Experimental work on market-based or non-market-based incentives</a></p>

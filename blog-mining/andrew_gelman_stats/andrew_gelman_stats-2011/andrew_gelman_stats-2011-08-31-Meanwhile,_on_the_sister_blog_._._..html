<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>4 0.098736979 <a title="882-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: My coblogger John Sides  feeds  a troll.  It’s a tough call.  Yesterday I gave my  reasoning  for ignoring these provocateurs, but in this case the troll in question is writing for a major newspaper so it makes sense for John to go to the trouble of shooting him down.  Even though I suspect the columnist was trolling for no better reason than . . . he had a deadline and nothing to say so he thought he’d wade into a controversy.
 
On the plus side, as a statistician I’m happy that statistics is considered important enough that it’s worth trolling!  When they start attacking like this, they must feel a bit on the defensive. . . .</p><p>6 0.079131387 <a title="882-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-02-I%E2%80%99ve_already_written_next_year%E2%80%99s_April_Fools_post%21.html">2085 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-02-I’ve already written next year’s April Fools post!</a></p>

Dear Editor 


We have done research in some of the cutting edge technology and engineering field and would like to if you will be able to write about it in your news section. 
Our Primarily research focus on building high performance systems that are helping in social networks, web, finding disease, cancer and sports using BIG DATA . Hope to hear from you some time soon.

<p>Introduction: There is live debate that will available this week for those that might be interested.  The topic:  Can early stopped trials result in misleading results of systematic reviews?
  

 
It’s sponsored by the Cochrane Collaboration and although the level of discussion is often not very technical, it does in my opinion provide a nice window into clinical research and as Tukey might put it “the real uncertainties involved”. 
 
(As a disclaimer – I once assigned some reading from this group to my graduate students and they were embarrassed and annoyed at the awkward handling of even minor technical issues – but the statistical research community is not their target audience.)
 
I have a favourite in this debate, and a quick search on co-authors (not me) would likely tip that off to most members of this blog. 
 
Here’s the directions kindly supplied by Jonathan Sterne, who will be in the chair.

<p>Introduction: As someone who relies strongly on survey research, it’s good for me to be reminded that some surveys are useful, some are useless, but one thing they almost all have in common is . . . they waste the respondents’ time.
 
I thought of this after receiving the following email, which I shall reproduce here.  My own comments appear after.
     
Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10 minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of the email appears below). We are emailing you today to debrief you on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study. We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced. Our hope is that this letter will provide a sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of our study to alleviate any concerns you may have about your involvement.

<p>Introduction: Respected political scientist Tim Groseclose just came out with a book, “Left Turn:  How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.”  I was familiar with Groseclose’s article (with Jeffrey Milyo) on media bias that came out several years ago–it was an interesting study but I was not convinced by its central claim that they were measuring an absolute level of bias–and then recently heard about this new book in the context of some  intemperate  things Groseclose said in a interview on the conservative Fox TV network.
 
Groseclose’s big conclusion is that in the absence of media bias, the average American voter would be positioned at around 25 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is a right-wing Republican and 100 is a left-wing Democrat.  (Seeing as the number line is conventionally drawn from left to right, I think it would make more sense for 0 to represent the left and 100 to be on the right, but I guess it’s too late for him to change now.)  Groseclose places the average voter now at around</p><p>6 0.6251604 <a title="882-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-23-Participate_in_a_research_project_on_combining_information_for_prediction.html">866 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-23-Participate in a research project on combining information for prediction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Ebert sends this along:
  
Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>4 0.71814859 <a title="882-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-26-Reflections_on_ethicsblogging.html">1694 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-26-Reflections on ethicsblogging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have to say, it distorts my internal incentives when I am happy to see really blatant examples of ethical lapses.  Sort of like when you’re cleaning the attic and searching for roaches:  on one hand, you’d be happy if there were none, but, still, there’s a thrill each time you find a roach and catch it—and, at that point, you want it to be a big ugly one!</p><p>5 0.71286821 <a title="882-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-Three_hours_in_the_life_of_a_statistician.html">1001 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-Three hours in the life of a statistician</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung tells  what it’s really like .
 
Here’s a sample:
  
As soon as I [Kaiser] put the substring-concatenate expression together with two lines of code that generate data tables, it choked.
  
Sorta like Dashiell Hammett without the broads and the heaters.

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.

<p>Introduction: From a comment I made in an email exchange:
 
My  work  on survey adjustments has very much been inspired by the ideas of Rod Little.  Much of my efforts have gone toward the goal of integrating hierarchical modeling (which is so helpful for small-area estimation) with post stratification (which adjusts for known differences between sample and population).  In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.
 
As I wrote in the first sentence of the above-linked paper, I do think the current theory and practice of survey weighting is a mess, in that much depends on so</p><p>6 0.17245829 <a title="761-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic_screening_to_get_an_approximate_self-weighted_sample.html">1455 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-12-Probabilistic screening to get an approximate self-weighted sample</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago we had an amazing all-star session at the Joint Statistical Meetings.  The topic was new approaches to survey weighting (which is  a mess , as I’m sure you’ve heard).
 
Xiao-Li Meng  recommended shrinking weights by taking them to a fractional power (such as square root) instead of trimming the extremes. 
 
Rod Little  combined design-based and model-based survey inference. 
 
Michael Elliott  used mixture models for complex survey design.

<p>Introduction: Here’s what I’ll talk about  for 3 hours : 
   
Statistics—Inside and Outside the Classroom
 
(1)  Of Beauty, Sex, and Power:  Statistical Challenges in the Estimation of Small Effects .  A silly example of the frequencies of boy and girl babies leads us to some important research involving the meaning of statistical significance. 
(2)  Mathematics, Statistics, and Political Science .  We explore the differences between mathematical and statistical thinking, developing the ideas using examples from my own research in political science. 
(3)  Statistics Teaching Activities .  For twenty years I have been collecting class-participation demonstrations in statistics and probability.  Here are some of my favorites.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97604716 <a title="761-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-A_survey%E2%80%99s_not_a_survey_if_they_don%E2%80%99t_tell_you_how_they_did_it.html">761 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-A survey’s not a survey if they don’t tell you how they did it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we’re on  the topic  of nonreplicable research . . . see  here  (link from  here ) for a story of a survey that’s so bad that the people who did it won’t say how they did it.
 
I know too many cases where people screwed up in a survey when they were actually trying to get the right answer, for me to trust any report of a survey that doesn’t say what they did.
 
I’m reminded of  this survey  which may well have been based on a sample of size 6 (again, the people who did it refused to release any description of methodology).</p><p>3 0.96787095 <a title="761-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-21-Exponential_increase_in_the_number_of_stat_majors.html">1816 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-21-Exponential increase in the number of stat majors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitztein sent around the following graph:
 
 
 
(The x-axis goes from 2000 to 2012 and the y=axis goes from 0 to 120.)
 
100 statistics majors (this combines sophomores, juniors, and seniors, but still, that’s a lot more than the 1 or 2 or 3 a year we’re used to seeing).  At first I was like, whoa!  But then I thought, why  not  100 or even 200 or 300 statistics majors?  Statistics is important in itself, it’s relatively easy as far as quantitative majors go, it’s applicable to lots of other areas.  The real question should be not, What’s been happening that’s made statistics so trendy lately? but rather, What took so long for this to happen, and why isn’t statistics more popular?  Both places where I studied as an undergraduate, statistics was just a subset of the math department, and maybe the only reason I ended up in statistics is that I took a probability course one semester because, at 5pm, it fit my schedule.</p><p>4 0.96679115 <a title="761-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-12-Peter_Thiel_is_writing_another_book%21.html">1895 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-12-Peter Thiel is writing another book!</a></p>

“I’m writing this book because we need to think about the future for more than just 140 characters or 15 minutes at a time if we want to make real long-term progress,” Mr. Thiel said in a statement. “’Zero to One’ is about learning from Silicon Valley how to solve hard problems and build great things that have never existed before.”

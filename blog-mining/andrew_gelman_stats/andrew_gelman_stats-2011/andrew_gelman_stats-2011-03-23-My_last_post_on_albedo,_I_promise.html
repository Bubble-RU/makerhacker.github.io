<p>Introduction: Readers of  this  bizarre story (in which a dubious claim about reflectivity of food in cooking transmuted into a flat-out wrong claim about the relevance of reflectivity of solar panels) might wonder how genius Nathan Myhrvold (Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton at age 24, postdoc with Stephen Hawking for chrissake) could make such a basic mistake.
 
In an earlier comment, I  dismissed  this with a flip allusion to Wile E. Coyote.  But now I’m thinking there’s something more going on.
 
In our blog discussion (see links above), Phil is surprised I didn’t take a stronger stance on the albedo issue after reading Pierrehumbert’s explanation.  Phil asks:  Why did I write “experts seem to think the albedo effect is a red herring” instead of something stronger such as, “as Pierrehumbert shows in detail, the albedo effect is a red herring”?
 
I didn’t do this because my physics credentials are no better than Myhrvold’s.  And, given that Myhrvold got it wrong, I don’t completely trus</p><p>3 0.34486431 <a title="625-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-18-Trolls%21.html">860 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-18-Trolls!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert points to  this  absurd patent of the Monte Carlo method (which, as Christian notes, was actually invented by Stanislaw Ulam and others in the 1940s).
 
The whole thing is pretty unreadable.  I wonder if they first wrote it as a journal article and then it got rejected everywhere, so they decided to submit it as a patent instead.
 
What’s even worse is this bit:
  
This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 0612170 and 0347408 awarded by the National Science Foundation.
  
So our tax dollars are being given to IBM so they can try to bring statistics to a halt by patenting one of our most basic tools?  I’d say this is just a waste of money, but given that our country is run by lawyers, there must be some outside chance that this patent could actually succeed?

<p>Introduction: This guy (Michael Risch) actually  did a survey .  It seems like cheating to add actual systematic knowledge to the debate. . . .
 
What Iâ&euro;&trade;m wondering is, can I file a retroactive patent on the concept of albedo?  I think I could make millions off the applications to  cooking  alone.</p><p>6 0.69123518 <a title="625-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-21-A_possible_resolution_of_the_albedo_mystery%21.html">622 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-21-A possible resolution of the albedo mystery!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Delia Baldassarri and Amir Goldberg  write :
  
Americans’ political beliefs present a long observed paradox. Whereas the mainstream political discourse is structured on a clearly defined polarity between conservative and liberal views, in practice, most people exhibit ideologically incoherent belief patterns. This paper challenges the notion that political beliefs are necessarily defined by a singular ideological continuum. It applies a new, network-based method for detecting heterogeneity in collective patterns of opinion, relational class analysis (RCA), to Americans’ political attitudes as captured by the American National Election Studies. By refraining from making a-priori assumptions about how beliefs are interconnected, RCA looks for opinion structures, belief networks, that are not necessarily congruent with received wisdom. It finds that in the twenty years between 1984 and 2004 Americans’ political attitudes were consistently structured by two alternative belief systems: one</p><p>2 0.979388 <a title="625-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-10-The_U.S._as_welfare_state.html">196 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-10-The U.S. as welfare state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My Columbia colleague Irv Garfinkel recently came out with a book (with coauthors Lee Rainwater and Timothy Smeeding), “Mythbusters:  The U.S. Social Welfare State,” where they argue:
  
The United States is a capitalist nation that has eschewed Scandinavian-style socialist policies in favor of capitalism and economic growth, right? Wrong. The U.S. is not only one of the largest welfare states in the world, but it is strong economically precisely because of its adoption of some socialist policies–with public education as the primary driver.


The American welfare state faces large challenges. Restoring its historical lead in education is the most important but requires investing large sums in education–beginning with universal pre-school–and in complementary programs–including selected cash benefits for families with children–that aid children’s development. The American health insurance system is by far the most costly in the rich world, yet fails to insure one sixth of its population</p><p>3 0.97581863 <a title="625-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-16-My_talk_in_Chicago_this_Thurs_6%3A30pm.html">1806 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-16-My talk in Chicago this Thurs 6:30pm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Choices in Visualizing Data 
 
This time, it’s not at the university, it’s at a data science meetup.   Here are the slides .
 
I actually prefer the term “statistical graphics” or “visualizing quantitative information” rather than “visualizing data.”  I spend a lot of time graphing inferences and fitted models, understanding my fits and doing exploratory model analysis.  Graphs aren’t just for raw data.
 
P.S.  Mike Stringer, who prepared the blurb for my talk at the above link, wrote that ARM “has the most understandable description of causal inference I’ve ever read.”  I appreciate the compliment, but, to be fair, Jennifer deserves most of the credit for the  causal chapters  of that book.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.9749462 <a title="625-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-23-My_last_post_on_albedo%2C_I_promise.html">625 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-23-My last post on albedo, I promise</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After seeing my recent  blogs  on Nathan Myhrvold, a friend told me that, in the tech world, the albedo-obsessed genius is known as a patent troll.
 
Really?
 
Yup.  My friend writes:
  
 
It’s perhaps indicative that Myhrvold comes up in the top-ten hits on Google for [patent troll]. These blog posts lay it out pretty clearly:

Just about anyone’s that’s been in the tech game thinks patents are ridiculous.  The lab where I used to work wanted us to create an “intellectual mine field” in our field so the companycould block anyone from entering the space.  Yes, we made stuff, but the patents were for totally obvious ideas that anyone would have.  Even Google’s PageRank was just a simple application of standard social network analysis models of authorities in netw</p><p>5 0.97125846 <a title="625-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-28-My_talk_at_American_University.html">376 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-28-My talk at American University</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Red State Blue State:  How Will the U.S. Vote? 
 
It’s the “annual Halloween and pre-election extravaganza” of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and they suggested I could talk on the zombies paper (of course), but I thought the material on voting might be of more general interest.
 
The “How will the U.S. vote?” subtitle was not of my choosing, but I suppose I can add a few slides about the forthcoming election.
 
Fri 29 Oct 2010, 7pm in Ward I, in the basement of the Ward Circle building.
 
Should be fun.  I haven’t been to AU since taking a class there, over 30 years ago.
 
P.S.  It was indeed fun.   Here’s  the talk.  I did end up briefly describing my zombie research but it didn’t make it into any of the slides.</p><p>6 0.96756321 <a title="625-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-12-Why_it_doesn%E2%80%99t_make_sense_to_chew_people_out_for_not_reading_the_help_page.html">955 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-12-Why it doesn’t make sense to chew people out for not reading the help page</a></p>

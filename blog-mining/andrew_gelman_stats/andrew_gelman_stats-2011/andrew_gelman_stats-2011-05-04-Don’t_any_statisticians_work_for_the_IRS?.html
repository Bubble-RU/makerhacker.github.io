<p>Introduction: Congressman  Kevin Brady  from Texas  distributes this visualization of reformed  health care  in the US (click for a bigger picture):
 
   
 
Here’s a  PDF  at Brady’s page, and a local  copy  of it.
 
Complexity has its costs. Beyond the cost of writing it, learning it, following it, there’s also the cost of checking it. John Walker has some  funny examples  of what’s hidden in the almost 8000 pages of IRS code.
 
Text mining and applied statistics will solve all that, hopefully. Anyone interested in developing a pork detection system for the legislation? Or an analysis of how much entropy to the legal code did each congressman contribute?
 
There are already  spin   detectors , that help you detect whether the writer is a Democrat (“stimulus”, “health care”) or a Republican (“deficit spending”, “ObamaCare”).

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
 This DC Streets Blog post  gives a concise summary of a report by “The Tax Foundation”.  The money shot is  here , a table that shows what fraction spending on roads in each state in the U.S. is covered by local, state, and federal gas taxes, tolls, registration fees, etc. (Click on the ‘rank’ table heading to put it in useful order). The national average is 51%, and in no state do drivers directly pay more than 80% of the cost of the roads and highways. That means that, nationwide, half the cost of the roads is paid out of general government funds. Even if it were 100% this still wouldn’t cover additional government costs of driving (such as military spending to protect the oil supply, and law enforcement costs, etc.) but I’ll ignore those in this post.
 
Of course, most of the general funds that make up the difference are themselves paid by people who drive, so this isn’t as grossly unfair as it seems. But it’s still pretty unfair, and it is a huge “market di</p><p>5 0.084374212 <a title="693-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-27-Question_17_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1348 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-27-Question 17 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 17. In a survey of n people, half are asked if they support “the health care law recently passed by Congress” and half are asked if they support “the law known as Obamacare.” The goal is to estimate the effect of the wording on the proportion of Yes responses. How large must n be for the effect to be estimated within a standard error of 5 percentage points?
 
 Solution to question 16 
 
From  yesterday :
  
16. You are doing a survey in a war-torn country to estimate what percentage of unemployed men support the rebels in a civil war. Express this as a ratio estimation problem, where goal is to estimate Y.bar/X.bar.  What are x and y here? Give the estimate and standard error for the percentage of unemployed men who support the rebels.
  
Solution:  x is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man, 0 otherwise.  y is 1 if the respondent is an unemployed man and supports the rebels, 0 otherwise.  The estimate is y.bar/x.bar [typo fixed], the standard error is (1/x.bar)*(1/sqrt(n))*s.z, whe</p><p>6 0.083384916 <a title="693-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-09-Recently_and_not-so-recently_in_the_sister_blog.html">1795 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-09-Recently and not-so-recently in the sister blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reihan Salam  discusses  a theory of Tyler Cowen regarding “threshold earners,” a sort of upscale version of a slacker.   Here’s Cowen :
  
A threshold earner is someone who seeks to earn a certain amount of money and no more. If wages go up, that person will respond by seeking less work or by working less hard or less often. That person simply wants to “get by” in terms of absolute earning power in order to experience other gains in the form of leisure.
  
Salam continues:
  
This clearly reflects the pattern of wage dispersion among my friends, particularly those who attended elite secondary schools and colleges and universities. I [Salam] know many “threshold earners,” including both high and low earners who could earn much more if they chose to make the necessary sacrifices. But they are satisficers.
  
OK, fine so far.  But then the claim is made that “threshold earning” behavior increases income inequality.  In Cowen’s words:
  
The funny thing is this: For years, many cultural c</p><p>3 0.79560494 <a title="693-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-28-Writing_for_free.html">2080 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-28-Writing for free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.
  
I’m lucky enough not to ever have had to bale hay or go door-to-door for a living, but I find writing to be enjoyable!  So I can see how it can be hard for Kreider to compete wi</p><p>4 0.77748603 <a title="693-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-%24.html">1003 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.

<p>Introduction: Our research assistants have unearthed the following guest column by H. L. Mencken which appeared in the New York Times of 5 Nov 1933, the date at which Prohibition ended in the United States. As a public service we are reprinting it here.
 
I’m particularly impressed at how the Sage of Baltimore buttressed his article with references to the latest scientific literature of the time. I think you’ll all agree that Mencken’s column, in which he took a stand against the legality of alcohol consumption, has  contemporary relevance , more than 80 years later.
 
Because of the challenge of interpreting decades-old references, we have asked a leading scholar of Mencken’s writings to add notes where appropriate, to clarify any points of confusion. And now here’s Mencken’s column (with notes added in brackets), in its entirety:
  
For a little while in my teenage years, my friends and I drank alcohol. It was fun. I have some fond memories of us all being silly together.

<p>Introduction: Steven Brams and James Jorash propose  a system  for reducing the advantage that comes from winning the coin flip in overtime:
  
Dispensing with a coin toss, the teams would bid on where the ball is kicked from by the kicking team. In the NFL, it’s now the 30-yard line. Under Brams and Jorasch’s rule, the kicking team would be the team that bids the lower number, because it is willing to put itself at a disadvantage by kicking from farther back. However, it would not kick from the number it bids, but from the average of the two bids.


To illustrate, assume team A bids to kick from the 38-yard line, while team B bids its 32-yard line.  Team B would win the bidding and, therefore, be designated as the kick-off team. But B wouldn’t kick from 32, but instead from the average of 38 and 32–its 35-yard line. 


This is better for B by 3 yards than the 32-yard line that it proposed, because it’s closer to the end zone it is kicking towards. It’s also better for A by 3 yards to have B kick fr</p><p>2 0.94927007 <a title="693-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-17-Stan_and_RStan_1.1.0.html">1627 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-17-Stan and RStan 1.1.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A friend asks the above question and writes:
  
 This article  left me thinking – how could the IRS not notice that this guy didn’t file taxes for several years? Don’t they run checks and notice if you miss a year? If I write a check our of order, there’s an asterisk next to the check number in my next bank statement showing that there was a gap in the sequence.


If you ran the IRS, wouldn’t you do this: SSNs are issued sequentially. Once a SSN reaches 18, expect it to file a return. If it doesn’t, mail out a postage paid letter asking why not with check boxes such as Student, Unemployed, etc. Follow up at reasonable intervals. Eventually every SSN should be filing a return, or have an international address. Yes this is intrusive, but my goal is only to maximize tax revenue. Surely people who do this for a living could come up with something more elegant.
  
My response:
 
I dunno, maybe some confidentiality rules?  The other thing is that I’m guessing that IRS gets lots of pushback w</p><p>4 0.91790056 <a title="693-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-13-CmdStan%2C_RStan%2C_PyStan_v2.2.0.html">2209 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-13-CmdStan, RStan, PyStan v2.2.0</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We’re happy to announce the release of Stan C++, CmdStan, 
RStan, and PyStan 2.1.0.  This is a minor feature release, 
but it is also an important bug fix release.  As always, the 
place to start is the (all new) Stan web pages:
 
 http://mc-stan.org 
 
 
 
 Major Bug in 2.0.0, 2.0.1 
 
Stan 2.0.0 and Stan 2.0.1 introduced a bug in the implementation 
of the NUTS criterion that led to poor tail exploration and 
thus biased the posterior uncertainty downward.  There was no 
bug in NUTS in Stan 1.3 or earlier, and 2.1 has been extensively tested 
and tests put in place so this problem will not recur.
 
If you are using Stan 2.0.0 or 2.0.1, you should switch to 2.1.0 as 
soon as possible and rerun any models you care about.
 
 
 
 New Target Acceptance Rate Default for Stan 2.1.0 
  Another big change aimed at reducing posterior estimation bias 
was an increase in the target acceptance rate during adaptation 
from 0.65 to 0.80.  The bad news is that iterations will take 
around 50% longer</p><p>6 0.88856077 <a title="693-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-21-Going_viral_%E2%80%94_not%21.html">864 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-21-Going viral — not!</a></p>

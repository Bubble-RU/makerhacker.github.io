I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.

I’m dealing with a situation where I have two datasets, one that assigns each participant a discrete score out of five for a set of particular traits (Dog behavior characteristics by breed), and another from an independent source that ranks each breed by each characteristic. It’s also possible to obtain the results of a survey, where experts were asked to rank 7 randomly picked breeds by characteristics.


I’m interested in obtaining estimates for each trait, and intuitively, it seems clear that the second and third dataset provide a lot of information. But it’s unclear how to incorporate them to infer latent variables, since only sample ranks are observed. This seems like it is a common problem, do you have any suggestions?
  
My quick answer is that you can treat ranks as numbers (a point we make somewhere in Bayesian Data Analysis, I believe) and just fit an item-response model from there.

<p>Introduction: I received an email from the Royal Statistical Society asking if I wanted to submit a 400-word discussion to the article,  Vignettes and health systems responsiveness in cross-country comparative analyses  by Nigel Rice, Silvana Robone and Peter C. Smith.
 
My first thought was No, I can’t do it, I don’t know anything about health systems responsiveness etc.  But then I thought, sure, I always have  something  to say.  So I skimmed the article and was indeed motivated to write something.  Here’s what I sent in:
  
As a frequent user of survey data, I am happy to see this work on improving the reliability and validity of subjective responses.  My only comment is to recommend that the statistical sophistication that is evident in the in the design and modeling in this study be applied to the summaries as well.  I have three suggestions in particular.

I get a lot out of these article-discussion-rejoinder packages, in all three of my roles as reader, writer, and discussant.
 
 Part 1:  The story of an unsuccessful discussion 
 
The first time I had a discussion article was the result of an unfortunate circumstance.  I had a research idea that resulted in an  article  with Don Rubin on monitoring the mixing of Markov chain simulations. I new the idea was great, but back then we worked pretty slowly so it was awhile before we had a final version to submit to a journal.  (In retrospect I wish I’d just submitted the  draft version  as it was.)  In the meantime I presented the paper at a conference.  Our idea was very well received (I had a sheet of paper so people could write their names and addresses to get preprints, and we got either 50 or 150 (I can’t remembe</p><p>6 0.11675341 <a title="744-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-28-Economists_argue_about_Bayes.html">1695 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-28-Economists argue about Bayes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following note from someone who’d like to remain anonymous: 
  
  
I read  your post  on ethics and statistics, and the comments therein, with much interest.


I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?

<p>Introduction: From Bannerjee and Duflo, “The Experimental Approach to Development Economics,” Annual Review of Economics (2009):
  
One issue with the explicit acknowledgment of randomization as a fair way to allocate the program is that implementers may find that the easiest way to present it to the community is to say that an expansion of the program is planned for the control areas in the future (especially when such is indeed the case, as in phased-in design).
  
I can’t quite figure out whether Bannerjee and Duflo are saying that  they  would lie and tell people that an expansion is planned when it isn’t, or whether they’re deploring that other people do it.
 
I’m not bothered by a lot of the deception in experimental research–for example, I think the Milgram obedience experiment was just fine–but somehow the above deception bothers me.  It just seems wrong to tell people that an expansion is planned if it’s not.
 
P.S.  Overall the article is pretty good.  My only real problem with it is that</p><p>4 0.79185838 <a title="744-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-04-Patterns.html">556 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-04-Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pete Gries writes:
  
I [Gries] am not sure if what you are  suggesting  by “doing data analysis in a patternless way” is a pitch for deductive over inductive approaches as a solution to the problem of reporting and publication bias. If so, I may somewhat disagree. A constant quest to prove or disprove theory in a deductive manner is one of the primary causes of both reporting and publication bias. I’m actually becoming a proponent of a remarkably non-existent species – “applied political science” – because there is so much animosity in our discipline to inductive empirical statistical work that seeks to answer real world empirical questions rather than contribute to parsimonious theory building. Anyone want to start a JAPS – Journal of Applied Political Science? Our discipline is in danger of irrelevance.

<p>Introduction: Some things I respect 
 
When it comes to meta-models of statistics, here are two philosophies that I respect:
 
1.  (My) Bayesian approach, which I associate with E. T. Jaynes, in which you construct models with strong assumptions, ride your models hard, check their fit to data, and then scrap them and improve them as necessary.
 
2.  At the other extreme, model-free statistical procedures that are designed to work well under very weak assumptions—for example, instead of assuming a distribution is Gaussian, you would just want the procedure to work well under some conditions on the smoothness of the second derivative of the log density function.
 
Both the above philosophies recognize that (almost) all important assumptions will be wrong, and they resolve this concern via aggressive model checking or via robustness.  And of course there are intermediate positions, such as working with Bayesian models that have been shown to be robust, and then still checking them.  Or, to flip it arou</p><p>6 0.77119523 <a title="744-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-18-You%E2%80%99ll_get_a_high_Type_S_error_rate_if_you_use_classical_statistical_methods_to_analyze_data_from_underpowered_studies.html">1944 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-18-You’ll get a high Type S error rate if you use classical statistical methods to analyze data from underpowered studies</a></p>

The importance of graphical displays in statistical practice has been recognized sporadically in the statistical literature over the past century, with wider awareness following Tukey’s Exploratory Data Analysis (1977) and Tufte’s books in the succeeding decades. But statistical graphics still occupies an awkward in-between position: Within statistics, exploratory and graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well-integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) is huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statisti</p><p>2 0.96244049 <a title="744-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-21-Model_complexity_as_a_function_of_sample_size.html">1543 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-21-Model complexity as a function of sample size</a></p>

 Robert Zubrin  writes in  “How Much Is an Astronaut’s Life Worth?”  ( Reason ,  Feb 2012 ):
     
…policy analyst John D. Graham and his colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found in 1997 that the median cost for lifesaving expenditures and regulations by the U.S. government in the health care, residential, transportation, and occupational areas ranges from about $1 million to $3 million spent per life saved in today’s dollars. The only marked exception to this pattern occurs in the area of environmental health protection (such as the Superfund program) which costs about $200 million per life saved.


Graham and his colleagues call the latter kind of inefficiency “ statistical murder ,” since thousands of additional lives could be saved each year if the money were used more cost-effectively. To avoid such deadly waste, the Department of Transportation has a policy of rejecting any proposed safety expenditure that costs more than $3</p><p>same-blog 4 0.96113729 <a title="744-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-03-Statistical_methods_for_healthcare_regulation%3A_rating%2C_screening_and_surveillance.html">744 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-03-Statistical methods for healthcare regulation: rating, screening and surveillance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here is my discussion of  a recent article  by David Spiegelhalter, Christopher 
Sherlaw-Johnson, Martin Bardsley, Ian Blunt, Christopher Wood and Olivia Grigg, that is scheduled to appear in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
 
I applaud the authors’ use of a mix of statistical methods to attack an important real-world problem. Policymakers need results right away, and I admire the authors’ ability and willingness to combine several different modeling and significance testing ideas for the purposes of rating and surveillance.
 
That said, I am uncomfortable with the statistical ideas here, for three reasons. First, I feel that the proposed methods, centered as they are around data manipulation and corrections for uncertainty, has serious defects compared to a more model-based approach. My problem with methods based on p-values and z-scores–however they happen to be adjusted–is that they draw discussion toward error rates, sequential analysis, and other technical statistical</p><p>5 0.94319153 <a title="744-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-07-X_on_JLP.html">1792 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-07-X on JLP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert  writes  on the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.  I have nothing to add to this beyond my recent  comments :
  
To me, the Lindley paradox falls apart because of its noninformative prior distribution on the parameter of interest. If you really think there’s a high probability the parameter is nearly exactly zero, I don’t see the point of the model saying that you have no prior information at all on the parameter. In short: my criticism of so-called Bayesian hypothesis testing is that it’s insufficiently Bayesian.


To clarify, I’m speaking of all the examples I’ve ever worked on in social and environmental science, where in some settings I can imagine a parameter being very close to zero and in other settings I can imagine a parameter taking on just about any value in a wide range, but where I’ve never seen an example where a parameter could be either right at zero or taking on any possible value. But such examples might occur in areas of application that I haven’t worked on.</p><p>6 0.94309735 <a title="744-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-18-Understanding_posterior_p-values.html">2029 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-18-Understanding posterior p-values</a></p>

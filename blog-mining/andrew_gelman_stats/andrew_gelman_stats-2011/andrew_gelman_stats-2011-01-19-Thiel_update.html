<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links :
  
“I’m writing this book because we need to think about the future for more than just 140 characters or 15 minutes at a time if we want to make real long-term progress,” Mr. Thiel said in a statement. “’Zero to One’ is about learning from Silicon Valley how to solve hard problems and build great things that have never existed before.”
  
I wonder how  Thiel’s previous book  turned out?</p><p>3 0.10144771 <a title="525-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-11-%24.html">1003 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-11-$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Felix Salmon relates the  story  of an economics Nobel Prize winner getting paid by a hedge fund.  It would all seems pretty silly—sort of like Coca-Cola featuring Michael Jordan in their ads—except that hedge funds are disreputable nowadays and so it seems vaguely sleazy for a scholar to trade on his academic reputation to make free money in this way.
 
It falls roughly in the same category as that notorious b-school prof in Inside Job who got $125K for writing a b.s. report about the financial stability of Iceland—and then, when they came back to him later and asked how he could’ve written it, he basically said:  Hey, I don’t know anything about Iceland, I was just taking their money!
 
That said, if a hedge fund offered  me  $125K to sit on their board, I’d probably take it!  It’s hard to turn down free money.
 
Or maybe not, I don’t really know.  So far, when companies have paid me $, it’s been to do something for them, to consult or give a short course.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  reviews  a recent book, “Lifecyle Investing,” by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff, two professors of management at Yale.  The book recommends that young adults take out loans to buy stocks and then hold these stocks for many years to prepare for retirement.
 
What I’m wondering is:  What’s the goal of writing this sort of book?  The main audience has got to be young adults (and their parents) who are already pretty well fixed, financially.  Students at Yale, for example.  And the book must be intended for people who are already beyond the standard recommendations of personal-investment books (pay off your credit card debt, don’t waste so much money on restaurant meals and fancy clothes, buy 1 used car instead of 2 new ones, etc).  Basically it sounds like they’re talking to people who have a lot of money but want to make sure that they retire rich rather than merely middle-class.
 
I can’t say that I’m morally opposed to helping the rich get richer.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been following with mild interest the recent news  stories  on the lawbreaking at the Steven A. Cohen hedge fund, for the silly reason that I gave a  paid lecture  for them a few years ago.  I wasn’t thinking too hard about whether they would be using my wonderful statistical ideas to be more effective at insider trading . . .
 
Recently Paul Alper sent me an email pointing out that one of the lawbreakers involved is named Gilman—perhaps he’s related to me?  Everyone is related to everyone else but I don’t know my relation to this particular guy.  I actually have an aunt whose last name is Gilman.  Here’s how it happened.  A few years after my father was born (but before the birth of his sister), my grandfather changed his name from Gelman to Gilman.  The story was that he was tired of people always calling him Gilman so he just changed his name.  I’d call that a true commitment to the descriptive approach to linguistics.  On the minus side, he gave my father’s older sister Luther</p><p>6 0.067907244 <a title="525-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-20-Domain_specificity%3A__Does_being_really_really_smart_or_really_really_rich_qualify_you_to_make_economic_policy%3F.html">45 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-20-Domain specificity:  Does being really really smart or really really rich qualify you to make economic policy?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reihan Salam  discusses  a theory of Tyler Cowen regarding “threshold earners,” a sort of upscale version of a slacker.   Here’s Cowen :
  
A threshold earner is someone who seeks to earn a certain amount of money and no more. If wages go up, that person will respond by seeking less work or by working less hard or less often. That person simply wants to “get by” in terms of absolute earning power in order to experience other gains in the form of leisure.
  
Salam continues:
  
This clearly reflects the pattern of wage dispersion among my friends, particularly those who attended elite secondary schools and colleges and universities. I [Salam] know many “threshold earners,” including both high and low earners who could earn much more if they chose to make the necessary sacrifices. But they are satisficers.
  
OK, fine so far.  But then the claim is made that “threshold earning” behavior increases income inequality.  In Cowen’s words:

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.

<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture.

<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.


Firstly, just because someone is a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, or any kind of successful entrepreneur for that matter, doesn’t mean they should be trusted with oth</p><p>2 0.87650436 <a title="525-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-19-%E2%80%9CThe_best_living_writer_of_thrillers%E2%80%9D.html">581 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-19-“The best living writer of thrillers”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the back of my yellowing pocket book of “The Mask of Dimitros” is the following blurb:
  
‘Eric Ambler is the best living writer of thrillers.’ — News Chonicle
  
What I’m wondering is, why the qualifier “living”?  Did the News Chronicle think there was a better writers of thrillers than Ambler who was no longer alive?  I can’t imagine who that could be, considering that Ambler pretty much defined the modern thriller.</p><p>3 0.86441088 <a title="525-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert_update%3A__cartooning_can_give_you_the_strength_to_open_jars_with_your_bare_hands.html">664 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert update:  cartooning can give you the strength to open jars with your bare hands</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>4 0.85616404 <a title="525-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-08-Gregor_Mendel%E2%80%99s_suspicious_data.html">1449 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-08-Gregor Mendel’s suspicious data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer points me to a  thoughtful discussion  by Moti Nissani on “Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox.”
 
The paradox, as Nissani defines it, is that Mendel’s data seem in many cases too good to be true, yet Mendel had a reputation for probity and it seems doubtful that he had a Mark-Hauser-style attitude toward reporting scientific data.  Nissani writes:
  
Taken together, the situation seems paradoxical. On the one hand, we have evidence that “the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel’s expectations.” We also have good reasons to believe that Mendel encountered linkage but failed to report it and that he may have taken the somewhat unusual step of having his scientific records destroyed shortly after his death. On the other hand, everything else we know about him/in addition to his undisputed genius/suggests a man of unimpeachable integrity, fine observational powers, and a pa</p><p>5 0.84581602 <a title="525-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-26-Antman_again_courts_controversy.html">973 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-26-Antman again courts controversy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>6 0.82761681 <a title="525-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-04-%E2%80%9CTurn_a_Boring_Bar_Graph_into_a_3D_Masterpiece%E2%80%9D.html">1154 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-04-“Turn a Boring Bar Graph into a 3D Masterpiece”</a></p>

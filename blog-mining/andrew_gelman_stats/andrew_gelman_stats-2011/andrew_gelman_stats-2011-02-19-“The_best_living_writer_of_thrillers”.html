<p>Introduction: I was stunned  this  from Jenny Davidson about mystery writers:
  
The crime fiction community is smart and adult and welcoming, and so many good books are being written (Lee Child was mentioning his peer group – i.e. they were the new kids around the same tie – being Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman – the list speaks for itself) . . .
  
Why was I stunned?  Because just a few days earlier I had a look at a book by Robert Crais.  It just happened that Phil, when he was visiting, had finished this book (which he described as “pretty good”) and left it with me so he wouldn’t have to take it back with him.  I’d never heard of Crais, but it had pretty amazing blurbs on the cover and Phil recommended it, so I took a look.
 
It was bad.  From page 1 it was bad.  It was like a bad cop show.  I could see the seams where the sentences were stitched together.  I could see how  somebody  might like this sort of book, but I certainly can’t understand the blurbs or the i</p><p>3 0.067170851 <a title="581-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-21-Careers%2C_one-hit_wonders%2C_and_an_offer_of_a_free_book.html">46 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-21-Careers, one-hit wonders, and an offer of a free book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: J. Robert Lennon  writes :
  
At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest. 
  
This naturally got me thinking about statisticians.  Some statisticians are famous (within</p><p>4 0.059700061 <a title="581-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-11-Debutante_Hill.html">1977 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-11-Debutante Hill</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was curious  so I ordered a used copy.  It was pretty good.  It fit in my pocket and I read it on the plane.  It was written in a bland, spare manner, not worth reading for any direct insights it would give into human nature, but the plot moved along.  And the  background material  was interesting in the window it gave into the society of the 1950s.  It was fun to read a book of pulp fiction that didnâ&euro;&trade;t have any dead bodies in it.
 
I wonder what Jenny Davidson would think of it.</p><p>5 0.057075121 <a title="581-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-06-Fun_with_google_autocomplete.html">1302 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-06-Fun with google autocomplete</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just finished reading this book by Kevin Cook.  Nothing surprising, but it’s got almost all the stories, including many that I’d never previously read.  Excellent if you like that sort of thing.

<p>Introduction: This  looks cool:
  
Ten years ago researchers in America took two groups of three-year-olds and showed them a blob of paint on a canvas. Children who were told that the marks were the result of an accidental spillage showed little interest. The others, who had been told that the splodge of colour had been carefully created for them, started to refer to it as “a painting”.


Now that experiment . . . has gone on to form part of the foundation of an influential new book that questions the way in which we respond to art. . . . The book, which is subtitled The New Science of Why We Like What We Like, is not an attack on modern or contemporary art and Bloom says fans of more traditional art are not capable of making purely aesthetic judgments either. “I don’t have a strong position about the art itself,” he said this weekend. “But I do have a strong position about why we actually like it.”
  
This sounds fascinating.  But I’m skeptical about this part:

<p>Introduction: This was an good idea:  take a bunch of old (and some recent) news articles on developments in mathematics and related ares from the past hundred years.  Fun for the math content and historical/nostalgia value.  Relive the four-color theorem, Fermat, fractals, and early computing.
 
I have too much of a technical bent to be the ideal reader for this sort of book, but it seems like an excellent gift for a non-technical reader who nonetheless enjoys math.  (I assume that such people are out there, just as there are people like me who canâ&euro;&trade;t read music but still enjoy reading about the subject.)
 
The book is organized by topic.  My own preference would have been chronological and with more old stuff.  I particularly enjoyed the material from many decades ago, such as the news report on one of the early computers.  This must have been a fun book to compile.</p><p>6 0.76547539 <a title="581-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-28-History_is_too_important_to_be_left_to_the_history_professors.html">2189 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-28-History is too important to be left to the history professors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On the back of my yellowing pocket book of “The Mask of Dimitros” is the following blurb:
  
‘Eric Ambler is the best living writer of thrillers.’ — News Chonicle
  
What I’m wondering is, why the qualifier “living”?  Did the News Chronicle think there was a better writers of thrillers than Ambler who was no longer alive?  I can’t imagine who that could be, considering that Ambler pretty much defined the modern thriller.</p><p>2 0.86064786 <a title="581-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert_update%3A__cartooning_can_give_you_the_strength_to_open_jars_with_your_bare_hands.html">664 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert update:  cartooning can give you the strength to open jars with your bare hands</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We were having so much fun on  this thread  that I couldn’t resist linking to  this news item  by Adrian Chen.  The good news is that Scott Adams (creater of the Dilbert comic strip) “has a certified genius IQ” and that he “can open jars with [his] bare hands.”  He is also “able to lift heavy objects.”  Cool!
 
In all seriousness, I knew nothing about this aspect of Adams when I wrote the earlier blog.  I was just surprised (and remain surprised) that he was so impressed with Charlie Sheen for being good-looking and being able to remember his lines.  At the time I thought it was just a matter of Adams being overly-influenced by his direct experience, along with some satisfaction in separating himself from the general mass of Sheen-haters out there.  But now I wonder if something more is going on, that maybe he feels that he and Sheen are on the same side in a culture war.
 
In any case, the ultimate topic of interest here is not Sheen or Adams but rather more general questions of what</p><p>3 0.85275757 <a title="581-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-19-Thiel_update.html">525 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-19-Thiel update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.


Firstly, just because someone is a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, or any kind of successful entrepreneur for that matter, doesn’t mean they should be trusted with oth</p><p>4 0.84172952 <a title="581-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-26-Antman_again_courts_controversy.html">973 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-26-Antman again courts controversy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>5 0.83478725 <a title="581-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-04-%E2%80%9CTurn_a_Boring_Bar_Graph_into_a_3D_Masterpiece%E2%80%9D.html">1154 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-04-“Turn a Boring Bar Graph into a 3D Masterpiece”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jimmy sends in  this .
 
   
 
Steps include “Make whimsical sparkles by drawing an ellipse using the Ellipse Tool,” “Rotate the sparkles . . . Give some sparkles less Opacity by using the Transparency Palette,” and “Add a haze around each sparkle by drawing a white ellipse using the Ellipse Tool.”
 
The punchline:
  
Now, the next time you need to include a boring graph in one of your designs you’ll be able to add some extra emphasis and get people to really pay attention to those numbers!

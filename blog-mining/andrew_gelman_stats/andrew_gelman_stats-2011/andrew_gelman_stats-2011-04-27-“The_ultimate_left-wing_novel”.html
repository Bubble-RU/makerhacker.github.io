My vote for the ultimate left-wing novel is 1984.  The story and the political philosophy fit together well, and it’s also widely read (which is an important part of being the “ultimate” novel of any sort, I think; it wouldn’t do to choose something too obscure).  Or maybe Gulliver’s Travels, but I’ve never actually read that, so I don’t know if it qualifies as being left-wing.

<p>Introduction: This  amusing-yet-so-true video directed by Eléonore Pourriat shows a sex-role-reversed world where women are in charge and men don’t get taken seriously.  It’s convincing and affecting, but the twist that interests me comes at the end, when the real world returns.  It’s really creepy.
 
And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat’s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don’t think would’ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.
 
The point here is that the real world is indeed what is real.  This alternative sex-role-reversed world is not actually possible, and what makes it interesting to think about is the contrast to what really is.

<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>4 0.11976835 <a title="682-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive_psychology_research_helps_us_understand_confusion_of_Jonathan_Haidt_and_others_about_working-class_voters.html">1373 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-09-Cognitive psychology research helps us understand confusion of Jonathan Haidt and others about working-class voters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s some psychology research that’s relevant to  yesterday’s discussion  on working-class voting.  In  a paper  to appear in the journal  Cognitive Science , Andrei Cimpian, Amanda Brandone, and Susan Gelman write:
  
Generic statements (e.g., “Birds lay eggs”) express generalizations about categories. In this paper, we hypothesized that there is a paradoxical asymmetry at the core of generic meaning, such that these sentences have extremely strong implications but require little evidence to be judged true. Four experiments confirmed the hypothesized asymmetry: Participants interpreted novel generics such as “Lorches have purple feathers” as referring to nearly all lorches, but they judged the same novel generics to be true given a wide range of prevalence levels (e.g., even when only 10% or 30% of lorches had purple feathers). A second hypothesis, also confirmed by the results, was that novel generic sentences about dangerous or distinctive properties would be more acceptable than</p><p>5 0.11416321 <a title="682-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-Whassup_with_those_crappy_thrillers%3F.html">115 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-Whassup with those crappy thrillers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was stunned  this  from Jenny Davidson about mystery writers:
  
The crime fiction community is smart and adult and welcoming, and so many good books are being written (Lee Child was mentioning his peer group – i.e. they were the new kids around the same tie – being Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman – the list speaks for itself) . . .
  
Why was I stunned?  Because just a few days earlier I had a look at a book by Robert Crais.  It just happened that Phil, when he was visiting, had finished this book (which he described as “pretty good”) and left it with me so he wouldn’t have to take it back with him.  I’d never heard of Crais, but it had pretty amazing blurbs on the cover and Phil recommended it, so I took a look.
 
It was bad.  From page 1 it was bad.  It was like a bad cop show.  I could see the seams where the sentences were stitched together.  I could see how  somebody  might like this sort of book, but I certainly can’t understand the blurbs or the i</p><p>6 0.10916648 <a title="682-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-29-Splitting_the_data.html">544 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-29-Splitting the data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I don’t have much sympathy for well-paid academic plagiarists who are too lazy to do their jobs, but I actually can feel for the author in  this story  who posted fake positive Amazon reviews of his own books and negative reviews of his competitors’.
 
I mean, sure, this is despicable behavior, I won’t deny that, but it’s gotta be harder and harder to make money writing books.  Even a so-called bestselling author must feel under a lot of pressure.  I was recently reading a book by Jonathan Coe—he’s just great, and famous, and celebrated, but I doubt he’s getting rich from his books.  Not that there’s any reason that he has to get rich, but if even  Jonathan Coe  isn’t living the high life, that’s not good for authors in general.  It’s a far cry from the days in which Updike, Styron, etc., could swagger around like bigshots.</p><p>3 0.8275013 <a title="682-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-02-The_new_Helen_DeWitt_novel.html">886 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-02-The new Helen DeWitt novel</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read the excerpt in n+1.  As one would expect of DeWitt, it was great, while being nothing at all like her  other  book.  THe new book reminded me a bit of Philip K. Dick.  Here’s a brief excerpt (which is not actually particularly PKD-like) of the main character talking to himself:
  
“I don’t have what it takes,” he said.  He had never said it before because saying it would be like admitting he couldn’t make the grade.
  
I’m not pulling out this quote to sell you on the book.  The lines just struck me because of the exquisite distinctions, the idea that “don’t have what it takes” is somehow different than “couldn’t make the grade,” the idea that this character, who expresses his thoughts in empty phrases, ends up assigning to these phrases a set of precise meanings that make sense only to him.
 
One reason Lightning Rods was so fun and refreshing to read is that it’s a non-formula novel that, unlike ChabonFranzenLethemBakerEtc—and, for that matter, unlike Virginia Woolf—is about c</p><p>4 0.82260084 <a title="682-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-08-Different_attitudes_about_parenting%2C_possibly_deriving_from_different_attitudes_about_self.html">564 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-08-Different attitudes about parenting, possibly deriving from different attitudes about self</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  discusses  his and Bryan Caplan’s reaction to that notorious book by Amy Chua, the Yale law professor who boasts of screaming at her children, calling them “garbage,” not letting them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano, etc.  Caplan thinks Chua is deluded (in the sense of not being aware of research showing minimal effects of parenting on children’s intelligence and personality), foolish (in writing a book and making recommendations without trying to lean about the abundant research on child-rearing), and cruel.  Cowen takes a middle view in that he doesn’t subscribe to Chua’s parenting strategies but he does think that his friends’ kids will do well (and partly because of his friends’ parenting styles, not just from their genes).
 
 Do you view yourself as special? 
 
I have a somewhat different take on the matter, an idea that’s been stewing in my mind for awhile, ever since I  heard about  the Wall Street Journal article that started this all.  My story is</p><p>5 0.80683374 <a title="682-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-13-Trips_to_Cleveland.html">30 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-13-Trips to Cleveland</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  writes about  The Ask, the new book by Sam Lipsyte, author of a hilarious book I read a couple years ago about a loser guy who goes to his high school reunion.  I haven’t read Lipsyte’s new book but was interested to see that he teaches at Columbia.  Perhaps I can take him to lunch (either before or after I work up the courage to call Gary Shteyngart and ask him about my theory that the main character of that book is a symbol of modern-day America).
 
In any case, in the grand tradition of reviewing the review, I have some thoughts inspired by DeWitt, who quotes from  this interview :

<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>2 0.91057837 <a title="682-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-The_Fixie_Bike_Index.html">1127 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-The Fixie Bike Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>3 0.9058187 <a title="682-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-30-History_is_too_important_to_be_left_to_the_history_professors%2C_Part_2.html">2192 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-30-History is too important to be left to the history professors, Part 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Completely non-gay historian Niall Ferguson, a man who  we can be sure  would never be caught at a ballet or a poetry reading,  informs us  that the British decision to enter the first world war on the side of France and Belgium was “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
Ummm, here are a few bigger errors: 
   
The German decision to invade Russia in 1941.
 
The Japanese decision to attack America in 1941.
 
 Oh yeah , the German decision to invade Belgium in 1914.
 
The Russian decision to invade Afghanistan in 1981 doesn’t look like such a great decision either.
 
And it wasn’t so smart for Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, but maybe the countries involved were too small for this to count as “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
It’s striking that, in considering the biggest error in modern history, Ferguson omits all these notorious acts of aggression (bombing Pearl Harbor, leading to the destruction of much of your country, that was pretty bad, huh?), and decides that the worst</p><p>4 0.88791025 <a title="682-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood_in_the_math_curriculum.html">992 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-05-Deadwood in the math curriculum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  asks :  What are the worst examples of curriculum dead wood?
 
Here’s the background:
  
One of the first things that hit me [Palko] when I started teaching high school math was how much material there was to cover. . . . The most annoying part, though, was the number of topics that could easily have been cut, thus giving the students the time to master the important skills and concepts.


The example that really stuck with me was synthetic division, a more concise but less intuitive way of performing polynomial long division. Both of these topics are pretty much useless in daily life but polynomial long division does, at least, give the student some insight into the relationship between polynomials and familiar base-ten numbers. Synthetic division has no such value; it’s just a faster but less interesting way of doing something you’ll never have to do.


I started asking hardcore math people — mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, rocket scientists — if they.’d ever u</p><p>5 0.87867981 <a title="682-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-The_Subtle_Micro-Effects_of_Peacekeeping.html">242 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-The Subtle Micro-Effects of Peacekeeping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>6 0.87275422 <a title="682-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-Classic_probability_mistake%2C_this_time_in_the_%28virtual%29_pages_of_the_New_York_Times.html">386 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-Classic probability mistake, this time in the (virtual) pages of the New York Times</a></p>

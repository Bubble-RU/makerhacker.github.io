<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>3 0.17734772 <a title="794-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-An_epithet_I_can_live_with.html">1604 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-An epithet I can live with</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.

<p>Introduction: Ricardo Pietrobon writes, regarding my  post  from last year on attitudes toward data graphics,
  
Wouldn’t it be the case to start formally studying the usability of graphics from a cognitive perspective? with platforms such as the mechanical turk it should be fairly straightforward to test alternative methods and come to some conclusions about what might be more informative and what might better assist in supporting decisions. btw, my guess is that these two constructs might not necessarily agree with each other.
  
And Jessica Hullman provides some background: 
  
  
Measuring success for the different goals that you hint at in your article is indeed challenging, and I don’t think that most visualization researchers would claim to have met this challenge (myself included). Visualization researchers may know the user psychology well when it comes to certain dimensions of a graph’s effectiveness (such as quick and accurate responses), but I wouldn’t agree with this statement as a gene</p><p>5 0.17491385 <a title="794-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-06-Thinking_seriously_about_social_science_research.html">1249 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-06-Thinking seriously about social science research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .


Yes, it can sometimes be possible for a graph to</p><p>4 0.77622038 <a title="794-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-22-%E2%80%9CInformation_visualization%E2%80%9D_vs._%E2%80%9CStatistical_graphics%E2%80%9D.html">816 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-22-“Information visualization” vs. “Statistical graphics”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By now you all must be tired of my one-sided presentations of the differences between infovis and statgraphics (for example,  this article  with Antony Unwin).
 
Today is something different.  Courtesy of Martin Theus, editor of the Statistical Computing and Graphics Newsletter, we have two short articles offering competing perspectives:
 
Robert Kosara writes from an Infovis view:
  
Information visualization is a field that has had trouble defining its boundaries, and that consequently is often misunderstood. It doesn’t help that InfoVis, as it is also known, produces pretty pictures that people like to look at and link to or send around. But InfoVis is more than pretty pictures, and it is more than statistical graphics.


The key to understanding InfoVis is to ignore the images for a moment and focus on the part that is often lost: interaction. When we use visualization tools, we don’t just create one image or one kind of visualization. In fact, most people would argue that there is</p><p>5 0.77581024 <a title="794-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>

I was just going through the latest draft of  your paper with Anthony Unwin . I heard part of it at  the talk  you gave (remotely) here at UMich.  I’m curious about your discussion of the  Baby Name Voyager .


The tool in itself is simple, attractive, and useful.  No argument from me there.  It’s an awesome demonstration of how subtle interactions can be very helpful (click and it zooms, type and it filters… falls perfectly into the Shneiderman visualization mantra). It satisfies a very common use case: finding appropriate names for children.


That said, I can’t help but feeling that what you are really excited about is  the very static analysis on last letters  (you spend most of your time on this).  This analysis, incidentally, is not possible to infer from the interactive application (which doesn’t support this type of filtering and pivoting).  In a sense, the two visualizations don’t have anything to do with each other (other than a shared context/dataset).</p><p>2 0.8964327 <a title="794-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-10-%E2%80%9CVersatile%2C_affordable_chicken_has_grown_in_popularity%E2%80%9D.html">655 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-10-“Versatile, affordable chicken has grown in popularity”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stan  is written in C++ and can be run from the command line and from R.  We’d like for  Python  users to be able to run Stan as well.  If anyone is interested in doing this, please let us know and we’d be happy to work with you on it.
 
Stan, like Python, is completely free and open-source.
 
P.S.  Because Stan is open-source, it of course would also be possible for people to translate Stan into Python, or to take whatever features they like from Stan and incorporate them into a Python package.  That’s fine too.  But we think it would make sense in addition for users to be able to run Stan directly from Python, in the same way that it can be run from R.</p><p>6 0.84530985 <a title="794-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk_worked.html">2238 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-09-Hipmunk worked</a></p>

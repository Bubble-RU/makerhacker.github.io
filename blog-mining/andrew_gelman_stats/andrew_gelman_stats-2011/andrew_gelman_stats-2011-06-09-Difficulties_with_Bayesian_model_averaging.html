 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables). Bayesian inference involves calculating the objective degree of plausibility of a hypothesis (typically the truth value of the hypothesis is a function of the variables mentioned above) given such a</p><p>3 0.26252368 <a title="754-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-28-The_holes_in_my_philosophy_of_Bayesian_data_analysis.html">781 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-28-The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been writing a lot about my philosophy of Bayesian statistics and how it fits into Popper’s ideas about falsification and Kuhn’s ideas about scientific revolutions.
 
 Here’s  my long, somewhat technical paper with Cosma Shalizi. 
 Here’s  our shorter overview for the volume on the philosophy of social science. 
 Here’s  my latest try (for an online symposium), focusing on the key issues.
 
I’m pretty happy with my approach–the familiar idea that Bayesian data analysis iterates the three steps of model building, inference, and model checking–but it does have some unresolved (maybe unresolvable) problems.  Here are a couple mentioned in the third of the above links.
 
Consider a simple model with independent data y_1, y_2, .., y_10 ~ N(θ,σ^2), with a prior distribution θ ~ N(0,10^2) and σ known and taking on some value of approximately 10. Inference about μ is straightforward, as is model checking, whether based on graphs or numerical summaries such as the sample variance and skewn</p><p>4 0.25140733 <a title="754-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-07-When_you%E2%80%99re_planning_on_fitting_a_model%2C_build_up_to_it_by_fitting_simpler_models_first.__Then%2C_once_you_have_a_model_you_like%2C_check_the_hell_out_of_it.html">1972 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-07-When you’re planning on fitting a model, build up to it by fitting simpler models first.

<p>Introduction: In response to  my remarks  on his online book, Think Bayes, Allen Downey wrote: 
   
I [Downey] have a question about one of your comments: 
   My [Gelman's] main criticism with both books is that they talk a lot about inference but not so much about model building or model checking (recall the three steps of Bayesian data analysis). I think it’s ok for an introductory book to focus on inference, which of course is central to the data-analytic process—but I’d like them to at least mention that Bayesian ideas arise in model building and model checking as well. 

This sounds like something I agree with, and one of the things I tried to do in the book is to put modeling decisions front and center.  But the word “modeling” is used in lots of ways, so I want to see if we are talking about the same thing.


For example, in many chapters, I start with a simple model of the scenario, do some analysis, then check whether the model is good enough, and iterate.

I had a question about BMA [Bayesian model averaging] and model combinations in general, and direct it to you since they are a basic form of hierarchical model, albeit in the simplest of forms. I wanted to ask what the underlying assumptions are that could lead to BMA improving on a larger model. 


I know model combination is a topic of interest in the (frequentist) econometrics community (e.g., Bates & Granger, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3008764?uid=3738032&uid;=2&uid;=4&sid;=21101948653381) but at the time it was considered a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps small models combined outperform a big model due to standard errors, insufficient data, etc. But I haven’t seen much in way of Bayesian justification.


In simplest terms, you might have a joint density P(Y,theta_1,theta_2) from which you could use the two marginals P(Y,theta_1) and P(Y,theta_2) to derive two separate forecasts. A BMA-er would do a weighted average of the two forecast densities, having p</p><p>6 0.23448287 <a title="754-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-20-Kind_of_Bayesian.html">811 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-20-Kind of Bayesian</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In my comments on David MacKay’s 2003 book on Bayesian inference, I  wrote  that I hate all the Occam-factor stuff that MacKay talks about, and I linked to  this quote  from Radford Neal:
  
Sometimes a simple model will outperform a more complex model . . . Nevertheless, I believe that deliberately limiting the complexity of the model is not fruitful when the problem is evidently complex. Instead, if a simple model is found that outperforms some particular complex model, the appropriate response is to define a different complex model that captures whatever aspect of the problem led to the simple model performing well.
  
MacKay replied as follows:
  
When you said you disagree with me on Occam factors I think what you meant was that you agree with me on them.  I’ve read your post on the topic and completely agreed with you (and Radford) that we should be using models the size of a  house, models that we believe in, and that anyone who thinks it is a good idea to  bias the model toward</p><p>3 0.91857457 <a title="754-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-05-Does_posterior_predictive_model_checking_fit_with_the_operational_subjective_approach%3F.html">320 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-05-Does posterior predictive model checking fit with the operational subjective approach?</a></p>

I have been thinking a lot lately about your Bayesian model checking approach.  This is in part because I have been working on exploratory data analysis and wishing to avoid controversy and mathematical statistics we omitted model checking from our discussion.  This is something that the refereeing process picked us up on and we ultimately added a critical discussion of null-hypothesis testing to  our paper .  The exploratory technique we discussed was essentially a 2D histogram approach, but we used Polya models as a formal model for the histogram.  We are currently working on a new paper, and we are thinking through how or if we should do “confirmatory analysis” or model checking in the paper.


What I find most admirable about your statistical work is that you clearly use the Bayesian approach to do useful applied statistical analysis.  My own attempts at applied Bayesian analysis makes me greatly admire your applied successes.

<p>Introduction: Cosma Shalizi  and  Larry Wasserman  discuss some papers from a conference on Ockham’s Razor.  I don’t have anything new to add on this so let me link to  past blog entries  on the topic and repost the following  from 2004 :
  
A lot has been written in statistics about “parsimony”—that is, the desire to explain phenomena using fewer parameters–but I’ve never seen any good general justification for parsimony.  (I don’t count “Occam’s Razor,” or “Ockham’s Razor,” or whatever, as a justification.  You gotta do better than digging up a 700-year-old quote.)


Maybe it’s because I work in social science, but my feeling is:  if you can approximate reality with just a few parameters, fine.  If you can use more parameters to fold in more information, that’s even better.


In practice, I often use simple models—because they are less effort to fit and, especially, to understand.  But I don’t kid myself that they’re better than more complicated efforts!

I know model combination is a topic of interest in the (frequentist) econometrics community (e.g., Bates & Granger, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3008764?uid=3738032&uid;=2&uid;=4&sid;=21101948653381) but at the time it was considered a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps small models combined outperform a big model due to standard errors, insufficient data, etc. But I haven’t seen much in way of Bayesian justification.


In simplest terms, you might have a joint density P(Y,theta_1,theta_2) from which you could use the two marginals P(Y,theta_1) and P(Y,theta_2) to derive two separate forecasts. A BMA-er would do a weighted average of the two forecast densities, having p</p><p>6 0.90642679 <a title="754-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-20-Kind_of_Bayesian.html">811 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-20-Kind of Bayesian</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Sides  points  to this discussion (with over 200 comments!) by political scientist Charli Carpenter of her response to a student from another university who emailed with questions that look like they come from a homework assignment.  Here’s the student’s original  email :
  
Hi Mr. Carpenter,


I am a fourth year college student and I have the honor of reading one of your books and I just had a few questions… I am very fascinated by your work and I am just trying to understand everything. Can you please address some of my questions? I would greatly appreciate it. It certainly help me understand your wonderful article better. Thank you very much! :)


1. What is the fundamental purpose of your article?


2. What is your fundamental thesis?


3. What evidence do you use to support your thesis?

<p>Introduction: Karri Seppa writes:
  
My topic is regional variation in the cause-specific survival of breast cancer patients across the 21 hospital districts in Finland, this component being modeled by random effects. I am interested mainly in the district-specific effects, and with a hierarchical model I can get reasonable estimates also for sparsely populated districts.


Based on the recommendation given in the book by yourself and Dr. Hill (2007) I tend to think that the finite-population variance would be an appropriate measure to summarize the overall variation across the 21 districts. However, I feel it is somewhat incoherent first to assume a Normal distribution for the district effects, involving a “superpopulation” variance parameter, and then to compute the finite-population variance from the estimated district-specific parameters. I wonder whether the finite-population variance were more appropriate in the context of a model with fixed district effects?

<p>Introduction: Robert Bell pointed me to  this post  by Brad De Long on Bayesian statistics, and then I also noticed  this  from Noah Smith, who wrote:
  
My impression is that although the Bayesian/Frequentist debate is interesting and intellectually fun, there’s really not much “there” there… despite being so-hip-right-now, Bayesian is not the Statistical Jesus.
  
I’m happy to see the discussion going in this direction.  Twenty-five years ago or so, when I got into this biz, there were some serious anti-Bayesian attitudes floating around in mainstream statistics.  Discussions in the journals sometimes devolved into debates of the form, “Bayesians:  knaves or fools?”.  You’d get all sorts of free-floating skepticism about any prior distribution at all, even while people were accepting without question (and doing theory on) logistic regressions, proportional hazards models, and all sorts of strong strong models.

<p>Introduction: I’ve talked about this a bit but it’s never had its own blog entry (until now).
 
Statistically significant findings tend to overestimate the magnitude of effects.  This holds in general (because E(|x|) > |E(x)|) but even more so if you restrict to statistically significant results.
 
Here’s an example.  Suppose a true effect of theta is unbiasedly estimated by y ~ N (theta, 1).  Further suppose that we will only consider statistically significant results, that is, cases in which |y| > 2.
 
The estimate “|y| conditional on |y|>2″ is clearly an overestimate of |theta|.  First off, if |theta|<2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance is not only too high in expectation, it's  always  too high.  This is a problem, given that |theta| is in reality probably is less than 2.  (The low-hangning fruit have already been picked, remember?)
 
But even if |theta|>2, the estimate |y| conditional on statistical significance will still be too high in expectation.

<p>Introduction: In response to  this article  by Cosma Shalizi and myself on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, David Hogg writes:
  
I [Hogg] agree–even in physics and astronomy–that the models are not “True” in the God-like sense of being absolute reality (that is, I am not a realist); and I  have argued  (a philosophically very naive 
paper, but hey, I was new to all this) that for pretty fundamental reasons we could never arrive at the True (with a capital “T”) model of the Universe.  The goal of inference is to find the “best” model, where “best” might have something to do with prediction, or explanation, or message length, or (horror!) our utility.  Needless to say, most of my physics friends *are* realists, even in the face of “effective theories” as Newtonian mechanics is an effective theory of GR and GR is an effective theory of “quantum gravity” (this plays to your point, because if you think any theory is possibly an effective theory, how could you ever find Truth?).

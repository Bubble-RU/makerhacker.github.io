<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>4 0.12123359 <a title="937-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-This_is_a_link_to_a_news_article_about_a_scientific_paper.html">302 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-This is a link to a news article about a scientific paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody I know sent me a link to  this news article  by Martin Robbins describing a potential scientific breakthrough.  I express some skepticism but in a vague enough way that, in the unlikely event that the research claim turns out to be correct, there’s no paper trail showing that I was wrong.  I have some comments on the graphs–the tables are horrible, no need to even discuss them!–and I’d prefer if the authors of the paper could display their data and model on a single graph.  I realize that their results reached a standard level of statistical significance, but it’s hard for me to interpret their claims until I see their estimates on some sort of direct real-world scale.  In any case, though, I’m sure these researchers are working hard, and I wish them the best of luck in their future efforts to replicate their findings.
 
I’m sure they’ll have no problem replicating, whether or not their claims are actually true.

<p>Introduction: John Cook  links  to a blog by Ben Deaton  arguing  that people often waste time trying to set up ideal working conditions, even though (a) your working conditions will never be ideal, and (b) the sorts of constraints and distractions that one tries to avoid, can often stimulate new ideas.
 
Deaton seems like my kind of guy–for one thing, he  works  on nonlinear finite element analysis, which is one of my longstanding interests–and in many ways his points are reasonable and commonsensical (I have little doubt, for example, that Feynman made a good choice in staying clear of the Institute for Advanced Study!), but I have a couple of points of disagreement.

<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>3 0.82585931 <a title="937-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-26-%E2%80%9CDo_you_need_ideal_conditions_to_do_great_work%3F%E2%80%9D.html">592 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-26-“Do you need ideal conditions to do great work?”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Journalist Jonathan Rauch  writes  that the internet is Sturgeon squared:
  
This is the blogosphere. I’m not getting paid to be here. I’m here to get incredibly famous (in my case, even more incredibly famous) so that I can get paid somewhere else. . . .


The average quality of newspapers and (published) novels is far, far better than the average quality of blog posts (and–ugh!–comments). This is because people pay for newspapers and novels. What distinguishes newspapers and novels is how much does not get published in them, because people won’t pay for it. Payment is a filter, and a pretty good one. Imperfect, of course. But pointing out the defects of the old model is merely changing the subject if the new model is worse. . . .


Yes, the new model is bringing a lot of new content into being. But most of it is bad. And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. Even in the information economy, there’s no free lunch. . . .


Yes, there’s g</p><p>5 0.80490261 <a title="937-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-28-Writing_for_free.html">2080 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-28-Writing for free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.
  
I’m lucky enough not to ever have had to bale hay or go door-to-door for a living, but I find writing to be enjoyable!  So I can see how it can be hard for Kreider to compete wi</p><p>6 0.80274767 <a title="937-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-24-Blogging.html">49 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-24-Blogging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We often hear that at the end of life, people often wish they hadn’t worked so hard.  (I’m assuming this is coming from executive types who have the option of working less, not people who had to work hard just to put food on the table.)
 
I don’t understand this.  Work is ok, but in almost any moment I much prefer relaxing to working.  Nonetheless I often wish I were working harder or had worked harder.  I don’t feel that I work too much.
 
So I don’t know what to think.  Am I just unusual?  Or maybe I already don’t work so hard, so there’s nothing for me to regret?  Or—and this is the scary option—maybe  right now  I wish I were working harder, but in twenty years I’ll regret that I spent so much time working?
 
Here’s one thing.  I like almost all the research papers I’ve written, but the vast majority (including some of my favorites) have had very few citations and, I assume, very little impact.  So maybe I worked too hard on some of them?</p><p>2 0.9766919 <a title="937-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-03-More_research_on_the_role_of_puzzles_in_processing_data_graphics.html">1747 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-03-More research on the role of puzzles in processing data graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ruth Rosenholtz of the department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT writes:
  
 We mostly do  computational modeling of human vision.  We try to do on the one hand the sort of basic science that fits in the human vision community, while on the other hand developing predictive models which might actually lend insight into design.  


 Your talk  resonated with me in part because of  this paper  [Do Predictions of Visual Perception Aid Design?, by Ruth Rosenholtz, Amal Dorai, and Rosalind Freeman].  We went into our study thinking that people would like to have a quantitative tool to help analyze designs.  But what we concluded, somewhat anecdotally, was that its main use seemed to be as a conversation-starter, and a means of communicating ideas about the design.  And  the reason it seemed to work is that our visualizations were the right level of a “puzzle” — challenging enough to be a bit fun to work out.

<p>Introduction: Sam Roberts  writes :
  
The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>4 0.97156286 <a title="937-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Two_stories_about_the_election_that_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">384 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Two stories about the election that I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>5 0.96961123 <a title="937-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Creating_a_good_wager_based_on_probability_estimates.html">138 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Creating a good wager based on probability estimates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose you and I agree on a probability estimate…perhaps we both agree there is a 2/3 chance Spain will beat Netherlands in tomorrow’s World Cup.  In this case, we could agree on a wager: if Spain beats Netherlands, I pay you $x.  If Netherlands beats Spain, you pay me $2x.  It is easy to see that my expected loss (or win) is $0, and that the same is true for you. Either of us should be indifferent to taking this bet, and to which side of the bet we are on.  We might make this bet just to increase our interest in watching the game, but neither of us would see a money-making opportunity here. 
 
By the way, the relationship between “odds” and the event probability — a 1/3 chance of winning turning into a bet at 2:1 odds — is that if the event probability is p, then a fair bet has odds of (1/p – 1):1.  
 
More interesting, and more relevant to many real-world situations, is the case that we disagree on the probability of an event.  If we disagree on the probability, then there should be</p><p>6 0.96763003 <a title="937-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-09-%E2%80%9C%E2%80%98Why_work%3F%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D.html">461 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-09-“‘Why work?’”</a></p>

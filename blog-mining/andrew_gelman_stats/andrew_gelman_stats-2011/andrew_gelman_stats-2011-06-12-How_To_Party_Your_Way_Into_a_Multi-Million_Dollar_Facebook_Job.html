<p>Introduction: More and more I feel like economics reporting is based on crude principles of adding up “good news” and “bad news.”  Sometimes this makes sense:  by almost any measure, an unemployment rate of 10% is bad news compared to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Other times, though, the good/bad news framework seems so tangled.
 
For example:  house prices up is considered good news but inflation is considered bad news.  A strong dollar is considered good news but it’s also an unfavorable exchange rate, which is bad news.  When facebook shares go down, that’s bad news, but if they automatically go up, that means they were underpriced which doesn’t seem so good either.  Pundits are torn between rooting for the euro to fail (which means our team (the U.S.) is better than Europe (their team)) and rooting for it to survive (because a collapse in Europe is bad news for the U.S. economy).

<p>Introduction: Biostatistician Jeff Leek  writes :
  
Think about this headline: “Hospital checklist cut infections, saved lives.” I [Leek] am a pretty skeptical person, so I’m a little surprised that a checklist could really save lives. I say the odds of this being true are 1 in 4.
  
I’m actually surprised that he’s surprised, since over the years I’ve heard about the benefits of checklists in various arenas, including hospital care.  In particular, there was  this article  by Atul Gawande from a few years back.  I mean, sure, I could imagine that checklists might hurt:  after all, it takes some time and effort to put together the checklist and to use it, and perhaps the very existence of the checklist could give hospital staff a false feeling of security, which would ultimately cost lives.  But my first guess would be that people still don’t do enough checklisting, and that the probability is greater than 1/4 that a checklist in a hospital will save lives.

Maybe…but not yet.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Loken  explains :
  
Some newspapers and radio stations recently picked up a story that Facebook profiles can be revealing, and can yield information more predictive of job performance than typical self-report personality questionnaires or even an IQ test. . . .


A most consistent finding from the last 50 years of organizational psychology research is that cognitive ability is the strongest predictor of job performance, sometimes followed closely by measures of conscientiousness (and recently there has been interest in perseverance or grit).  So has the Facebook study upended all this established research?  Not at all, and the reason lies in the enormous gap between the claims about the study’s outcomes, and the details of what was actually done.


The researchers had two college population samples.  In Study 1 they had job performance ratings for the part-time college jobs of about 10% of the original sample.  But in study 1 they did not have any IQ or cognitive ability measure.</p><p>5 0.073534206 <a title="760-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Data_mining_efforts_for_Obama%E2%80%99s_campaign.html">951 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Data mining efforts for Obama’s campaign</a></p>

Users of the  Obama 2012 – Are You In?  app are not only giving the campaign personal data like their name, gender, birthday, current city, religion and political views, they are sharing their list of friends and information those friends share, like their birthday, current city, religion and political views.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Salmon is dismissive of the claim that there are fifty million over-the-air television viewers:

 
The 50 million number, by the way, should not be considered particularly reliable: it’s Aereo’s guess as to the number of people who ever watch free-to-air TV, even if they mainly watch cable or satellite. (Maybe they have a hut somewhere with an old rabbit-ear TV in it.)
 

And he strongly suggests the number is not only smaller but shrinking. By comparison, here’s a story from the broadcasting news site TV News Check from June of last year (if anyone has more recent numbers please let me know):

 
According to new research by GfK Media, the number of Americans now relying solely on over-the-air (OTA) television reception increased to almost 54 million, up from 46 million just a year ago. The recently completed survey also found that the demographics of broadcast-only households skew towards younger adults, minorities and lower-income families.
 
  
As Palko says,</p><p>4 0.67656678 <a title="760-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-18-Florida_backlash.html">2216 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-18-Florida backlash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a post entitled, “A holiday message from the creative class to Richard Florida — screw you,” Mark Palko  argues  that Florida’s famous theories about the rise of the creative class have not held up over time:
  
Florida paints a bright picture of these people and their future, with rapidly increasing numbers, influence and wealth. He goes so far as to say “Places that succeed in attracting and retaining creative class people prosper; those that fail don’t.” . . .
  
But, Palko argues,
  
Except for a few special cases, this may be the worst time to make a living in the arts since the emergence of modern newspapers and general interest magazines and other mass media a hundred and twenty years ago . . . Though we now have tools that make creating and disseminating art easier than ever, no one has come up with a viable business model that supports creation in today’s economy. . . .
  
OK, fine, so individual creatives aren’t doing so well?  But what about the larger urban economies?

<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar points me to this  post :
  
At Priceonomics, we’ve learned that our users don’t want to buy used products. Rather, they want to buy inexpensive products, and used items happen to be inexpensive. Let someone else eat the initial depreciation, Priceonomics users will swoop in later and get a good deal. . . .


But if you want to buy a used television, you are in for a world of hurt. As you peruse through the Craigslist listings for used TVs, you may notice something surprising – the prices are kind of high. Do a quick check on Amazon and your suspicions will be confirmed; lots of people try to sell their used television for more than that same TV would cost brand new. . . .


To test our suspicions that something was amiss in the used television market, we compared used TV prices to the prices of buying them new instead. . . .

<p>Introduction: This news article  by Ryan Tate is an amazing bit of sociology:
  
If you want Facebook to spend millions of dollars hiring you, it helps to be a talented engineer, as the New York Times today [18 May 2011] suggests. But it also helps to carouse with Facebook honchos, invite them to your dad’s Mediterranean party palace, and get them introduced to your father’s venture capital pals, like Sam Lessin did.


Lessin is the poster boy for today’s Times story on Facebook “talent acquisitions.” Facebook spent several million dollars to buy Lessin’s drop.io, only to shut it down and put Lessin to work on internal projects. To the Times, Lessin is an example of how “the best talent” fetches tons of money these days. “Engineers are worth half a million to one million,” a Facebook executive told the paper.


We’ll let you in on a few things the Times left out: Lessin is not an engineer, but a Harvard social studies major and a former Bain consultant. His file-sharing startup drop.io was an also-r</p><p>2 0.94218278 <a title="760-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-10-Psychology_can_be_improved_by_adding_some_economics.html">1717 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-10-Psychology can be improved by adding some economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On this blog I’ve occasionally written about the problems that arise when economists act as amateur psychologists.  But the problem can go the other way, too.  For example, consider  this blog  by Berit Brogaard and Kristian Marlow ( link  from Abbas Raza).  Brogaard and Marlow give several amusing stories about ripoffs (a restaurant that scams customers into buying expensive bottles of wine, a hairdresser that sucks customers into unnecessary treatments, a ghostwriter who takes thousands of dollars in payments and doesn’t do the job, etc.).  Then they ask, “How did it happen? Why did you act in this impulsive way? Why didn’t you learn your lesson the first time around? Do you have some kind of brain damage?”
 
They continue with some discussion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula, etc etc etc., and then conclude with the following advice:
  
Is there anything we can do to avoid these moments of crazy decision-making? Yes but only by intentionally turning on our</p><p>3 0.93262672 <a title="760-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-28-Homework_and_treatment_levels.html">542 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-28-Homework and treatment levels</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>4 0.92314827 <a title="760-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-26-What_do_people_do_wrong%3F__WSJ_columnist_is_looking_for_examples%21.html">1640 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-26-What do people do wrong?

I’m working on a column this week about numerical/statistical tips and resolutions for writers and people in other fields in the new year. 2013 is the International Year of Statistics, so I’d like to offer some ways to better grapple with statistics in the year ahead. Here’s where you come in. If you have time in the next couple of days, please send me an idea or three about what people often do incorrectly when it comes to numbers, and how they could do better, without making things much more complicated. Maybe with an example of something you’ve seen that rubbed you the wrong way, and how you’d fix it. Bonus if you can tie it in to some sort of statistic that will be particularly relevant in 2013.


Any ideas of yours I use, I’ll credit, of course.

I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

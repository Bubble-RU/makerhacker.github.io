Adam Gopnik, writing for the  New Yorker , has a review called  Get Smart  in the most recent issue (4 April 2011).  Ostensibly, the piece is a review of new books, one by Joshua Foer,  Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything , and one by Stephen Baker  Final Jeopardy: Man vs. Machine and the Quest to Know Everything  (which would explain Baker’s spate of  Jeopardy!-related blog posts ).  But like many such pieces in highbrow magazines, the book reviews are just a cover for staking out a philosophical position.  Gopnik does a typically  New Yorker  job in explaining the title of this blog post.

<p>Introduction: Psychology researcher Alison Gopnik  discusses  the idea that some of the systematic problems with human reasoning can be explained by systematic flaws in the statistical models we implicitly use.
 
I really like this idea and I’ll return to it in a bit.  But first I need to discuss a minor (but, I think, ultimately crucial) disagreement I have with how Gopnik describes Bayesian inference.  She writes:
  
The Bayesian idea is simple, but it turns out to be very powerful. It’s so powerful, in fact, that computer scientists are using it to design intelligent learning machines, and more and more psychologists think that it might explain human intelligence. Bayesian inference is a way to use statistical data to evaluate hypotheses and make predictions. These might be scientific hypotheses and predictions or everyday ones.
  
So far, so good.  Next comes the problem (as I see it).  Gopnik writes:

<p>Introduction: Under the heading, “Why Preschool Shouldn’t Be Like School,” cognitive psychologist Alison Gopnik  describes  research showing that four-year-olds learn better if they’re encouraged to discover and show to others, rather than if they’re taught what to do.  This makes sense, but it’s not clear to me why this wouldn’t apply to older kids and adults.  It’s a commonplace in teaching at all levels that students learn by doing and by demonstrating what they can do.  Even when a student is doing nothing but improvising from a template, we generally believe the student will learn better by explaining what’s going on, by having a mental model of the process to go along with the proverbial 10,000 hours or practice.  The challenge is in the implementation, how to get students interested, motivated, and focused enough to put the effort into learning.
 
So why the headline above?  Why does Gopnik’s research support the idea that preschool should be different from school?

<p>Introduction: Gary Marcus  writes ,
  
An algorithm that is good at chess won’t help parsing sentences, and one that parses sentences likely won’t be much help playing chess.
  
That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.  I’d much rather have had twice as much detail on the first part of the life and then had the post-1972 era compr</p><p>3 0.73178607 <a title="634-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-22-Goal%3A__Rules_for_Turing_chess.html">1818 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-22-Goal:  Rules for Turing chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Daniel Murell has more thoughts on  Turing chess  (last discussed  here ):
  
When I played with my brother, we had it that if you managed to lap someone while running around the house, then you got an additional move. This means that if you had the option to take the king on your additional move, you could, and doing so won you the game. He was fitter at the time so he slipped in two additional moves over the course of the game. I still won :) I am much better at him at chess though, so I’m sure he would have beaten me had we been more even.


W.r.t. dsquared’s  comment  and your response, I’m not overly concerned about the first move, because you can enforce that white must reach a halfway point or that some time interval elapse before black makes his first move.


This version though does have one significant weakness that is evident to me. If you wait a little for your opponent to return to make his second move in a row against you, you get your breath back.

We’ve recently put up some interesting new competitions. Last week, Jeff Sonas, the creator of the Chessmetrics rating system,  launched a competition  to find a chess rating algorithm that performs better than the official Elo system. Already  nine teams  have created systems that make more accurate predictions than Elo. It’s not a surprise that Elo has been outdone – the system was invented half a century ago before we could easily crunch large amounts of historical data. However, it is a big surprise that Elo has been outperformed so quickly given that it is the product of many years’ work (at least it was a surprise to me).

Personally my Kasparov number is two: I beat ** in a regular tournament game, and ** beat Kasparov!
  
That’s pretty impressive, especially given that I didn’t know this guy played chess at all!  Anyway, this got me thinking, what’s my Kasparov number?  OK, that’s easy.  I beat Magnus Carlsen the other day when he was passing through town on vacation, Carlsen beat Anand, . . .
 
OK, just kidding.  What  is  my Kasparov number, though? Note that the definition, unlike that of the Erdos or Bacon numbers, is asymmetric:  it has to be that I had a victory over person 1, and person 1 had a victory over person 2, etc., and ultimately person N-1 had a victory over Kasparov.

<p>Introduction: David Schminovich points me to  this paper  by Yu Lu, H. Mo, Martin Weinberg, and Neal Katz:
  
We believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape the observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions. The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. . . .
  
And here’s  another  from the same authors, this time on “Bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the K-band luminosity function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation.”

Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>4 0.89478624 <a title="634-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-More_reason_to_like_Sims_besides_just_his_name.html">952 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-More reason to like Sims besides just his name</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Horton points to  Sims ‘s  comment on Angrist and Pischke :
  
Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)

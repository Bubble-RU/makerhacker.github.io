<p>Introduction: Jim Thomson writes:
  
I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>3 0.16212389 <a title="918-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-07-An_%28impressive%29_increase_in_survival_rate_from_50%25_to_60%25_corresponds_to_an_R-squared_of_%28only%29_1%25.__Counterintuitive%2C_huh%3F.html">1524 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-07-An (impressive) increase in survival rate from 50% to 60% corresponds to an R-squared of (only) 1%.

<p>Introduction: I was just reading  an old post  and came across this example which I’d like to share with you again:
  
Here’s a story of R-squared = 1%. Consider a 0/1 outcome with about half the people in each category. For.example, half the people with some disease die in a year and half live. Now suppose there’s a treatment that increases survival rate from 50% to 60%. The unexplained sd is 0.5 and the explained sd is 0.05, hence R-squared is 0.01.</p><p>4 0.11107472 <a title="918-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-09-%E2%80%9CHeterogeneity_of_variance_in_experimental_studies%3A__A_challenge_to_conventional_interpretations%E2%80%9D.html">1891 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-09-“Heterogeneity of variance in experimental studies:  A challenge to conventional interpretations”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Avi sent along  this old paper  from Bryk and Raudenbush, who write:
  
The presence of heterogeneity of variance across groups indicates that the standard statistical model for treatment effects no longer applies. Specifically, the assumption that treatments add a constant to each subject’s development fails. An alternative model is required to represent how treatment effects are distributed across individuals. We develop in this article a simple statistical model to demonstrate the link between heterogeneity of variance and random treatment effects. Next, we illustrate with results from two previously published studies how a failure to recognize the substantive importance of heterogeneity of variance obscured significant results present in these data. The article concludes with a review and synthesis of techniques for modeling variances. Although these methods have been well established in the statistical literature, they are not widely known by social and behavioral scientists.

<p>Introduction: For awhile I’ve been fitting most of my multilevel models using lmer/glmer, which gives point estimates of the group-level variance parameters (maximum marginal likelihood estimate for lmer and an approximation for glmer).  I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.  Typically, when this happens, it’s not that we’re so sure the variance is close to zero or that the correlation is close to 1 or -1; rather, the marginal likelihood does not provide a lot of information about these parameters of the group-level error distribution.
 
I don’t want point estimates on the boundary.  I don’t want to say that the unexplained variance in some dimension is exactly zero.

<p>Introduction: David Hsu writes: 
   
 I have a (perhaps) simple question about uncertainty in parameter estimates using multilevel models — what is an appropriate threshold for measure parameter uncertainty in a multilevel model? 
 
The reason why I ask is that I set out to do a crossed two-way model with two varying intercepts, similar to your flight simulator example in your 2007 book.  The difference is that I have a lot of predictors specific to each cell (I think equivalent to airport and pilot in your example), and I find after modeling this in JAGS, I happily find that the predictors are much less important than the variability by cell (airport and pilot effects).  Happily because this is what I am writing a paper about.
 
However, I then went to check subsets of predictors using lm() and lmer().  I understand that they all use different estimation methods, but what I can’t figure out is why the errors on all of the coefficient estimates are *so* different.

<p>Introduction: Continuing our discussion of general measures of correlations, Ben Murrell sends along  this paper  (with  corresponding  R package), which begins:
  
When two variables are related by a known function, the coefficient of determination (denoted R-squared) measures the proportion of the total variance in the observations that is explained by that function. This quantifies the strength of the relationship between variables by describing what proportion of the variance is signal as opposed to noise. For linear relationships, this is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient, ρ. When the parametric form of the relationship is unknown, however, it is unclear how to estimate the proportion of explained variance equitably – assigning similar values to equally noisy relationships. Here we demonstrate how to directly estimate a generalized R-squared when the form of the relationship is unknown, and we question the performance of the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) – a recently pr</p><p>4 0.64045924 <a title="918-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-28-Difficulties_of_using_statistical_significance_%28or_lack_thereof%29_to_sift_through_and_compare_research_hypotheses.html">2042 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-28-Difficulties of using statistical significance (or lack thereof) to sift through and compare research hypotheses</a></p>

Thought you might be interested in an example that touches on a couple recurring topics: 
1. The  difference  between a statistically significant finding and one that is non-significant need not be itself statistically significant (thus highlighting the problems of using NHST to declare whether an effect exists or not). 
2. Continued issues with the credibility of high profile studies of “social contagion”, especially by  Christakis and Fowler .


A new paper in  Archives of Sexual Behavior  produces observational estimates of peer effects in sexual behavior and same-sex attraction. In the text, the authors (who include C&F;) make repeated comparisons of the results for peer effects in sexual intercourse and those for peer effects in same-sex attraction. However, the 95% CI for the later actually includes the point estimate for the former! This is most clear in Figure 2, as highlighted by Real Clear Science’s  blog post  about the study.

The authorâ&euro;&trade;s estimate was far lower than many scholars and activists had contended, and it included a relatively high proportion of persons self-identifying as bisexuals. This article responds to two of the central criticisms that arose in the controversy that followed. First, in response to claims that his estimate did not account for people who are in the closet, the author describes how demographers might measure the size of the closet. Second, in response to those who either ignored the reported large incidence of bisexuality or misconstrued the meaning of that incidence, the Author considers how varying frameworks for conceptualizing sexual orientation might alter the ratio of lesbian or gay individuals to bisexuals.

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>2 0.9437412 <a title="918-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-Getting_into_hot_water_over_hot_graphics.html">225 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-Getting into hot water over hot graphics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pablo Verde sends in  this letter  he and Daniel Curcio just published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. They had published a meta-analysis with a boundary estimate which, he said, gave nonsense results.  Here’s Curcio and Verde’s key paragraph:
  
The authors [of the study they are criticizing] performed a test of heterogeneity between studies. Given that the test result was not significant at 5%, they decided to pool all the RRs by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in meta-analysis, which usually leads to very misleading results. First of all, the pooled RR as well as its standard	error are sensitive to 2 the estimation of the between-studies standard deviation (SD).	SD is difficult to estimate with a small number of studies. On the other hand, it is very well known that the significant test of hetero- geneity lacks statistical power to detect values of SD greater than zero. In addition, the statistically non-significant re</p><p>4 0.89972615 <a title="918-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-20-Andy_vs._the_Ideal_Point_Model_of_Voting.html">355 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-20-Andy vs. the Ideal Point Model of Voting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression   
book (p. 317), using the U.S. Senate instead of the Supreme Court, and 
ignoring the dis</p><p>5 0.88546157 <a title="918-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-25-Lauryn_Hill_update.html">233 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-25-Lauryn Hill update</a></p>

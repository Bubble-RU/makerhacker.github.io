<p>Introduction: There has been an increasing discussion about the proliferation of flawed research in psychology and medicine, with some landmark events being John Ioannides’s  article , “Why most published research findings are false” (according to Google Scholar, cited 973 times since its appearance in 2005), the scandals of Marc Hauser and Diederik Stapel, two leading psychology professors who resigned after disclosures of scientific misconduct, and Daryl Bem’s  dubious  recent paper on ESP, published to much  fanfare  in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, one of the top journals in the field.
 
Alongside all this are the plagiarism scandals, which are uninteresting from a scientific context but are relevant in that, in many cases, neither the institutions housing the plagiarists nor the editors and publishers of the plagiarized material seem to care.  Perhaps these universities and publishers are more worried about bad publicity (and maybe lawsuits, given that many of the plagiarism cas</p><p>3 0.30569017 <a title="762-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-25-A_new_Bem_theory.html">1998 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-25-A new Bem theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I was talking with someone who knows Daryl Bem a bit, and he was sharing his thoughts on that  notorious  ESP paper that was published in a leading journal in the field but then was mocked, shot down, and was repeatedly replicated with no success.  My friend said that overall the Bem paper had positive effects in forcing psychologists to think more carefully about what sorts of research results should or should not be published in top journals, the role of replications, and other things.
 
I expressed agreement and shared my thought that, at some level, I don’t think Bem himself fully believes his ESP effects are real.  Why do I say this?  Because he seemed oddly content to publish results that were not quite conclusive.  He ran a bunch of experiments, looked at the data, and computed some post-hoc p-values in the .01 to .05 range.  If he really were confident that the phenomenon was real (that is, that the results would apply to new data), then he could’ve easily run the</p><p>4 0.30052418 <a title="762-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-24-Difficulties_in_publishing_non-replications_of_implausible_findings.html">1137 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-24-Difficulties in publishing non-replications of implausible findings</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Tassone points me to  this  news article by Christopher Shea on the challenges of debunking ESP.  Shea  writes :
  
Earlier this year, a major psychology journal published a paper suggesting that there was some evidence for “pre-cognition,” a form of ESP. Stuart Ritchie, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh, is part of a team that tried, but failed, to replicate those results. Here, he tells the Chronicle of Higher Education’s Tom Bartlett about the difficulties he’s had getting the results published.


Several journals told the team they wouldn’t publish a study that did no more than disprove a previous study. . . . An editor at another journal said he’d “only accept our paper if we ran a fourth experiment where we got a believer [in ESP] to run all the participants, to control for . . . experimenter effects.”
  
My reaction is, this isn’t as easy a question as it might seem.  At first, one’s reaction might share Ritchie’s frustration that a shoddy paper by Bem got p</p><p>5 0.22317475 <a title="762-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-With_a_bit_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_again_on_this_topic%2C_and_with_a_lot_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_today.html">576 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-With a bit of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post again on this topic, and with a lot of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post today</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Masse points me to  this response  by Daryl Bem and two statisticians (Jessica Utts and Wesley Johnson) to criticisms by Wagenmakers et.al. of Bem’s recent ESP study.  I have nothing to add but would like to repeat a couple bits of my discussions of last month, of  here :
  
Classical statistical methods that work reasonably well when studying moderate or large effects (see the work of Fisher, Snedecor, Cochran, etc.) fall apart in the presence of small effects.


I think it’s naive when people implicitly assume that the study’s claims are correct, or the study’s statistical methods are weak. Generally, the smaller the effects you’re studying, the better the statistics you need. ESP is a field of small effects and so ESP researchers use high-quality statistics.


To put it another way: whatever methodological errors happen to be in the paper in question, probably occur in lots of researcher papers in “legitimate” psychology research. The difference is that when you’re studying a</p><p>6 0.20050889 <a title="762-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-06-That_silly_ESP_paper_and_some_silliness_in_a_rebuttal_as_well.html">506 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-06-That silly ESP paper and some silliness in a rebuttal as well</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Are women three times more likely to wear red or pink when they are most fertile? No, probably not. But here’s how hardworking researchers, prestigious scientific journals, and gullible journalists have been fooled into believing so.


The paper I’ll be talking about appeared online this month in Psychological Science, the flagship journal of the Association for Psychological Science, which represents the serious, research-focused (as opposed to therapeutic) end of the psychology profession. . . .


In focusing on this (literally) colorful example, I don’t mean to be singling out this particular research team for following what are, unfortunately, standard practices in experimental research. Indeed, that this article was published in a leading journal is evidence that its statistical methods were considered acceptable. Statistics textbooks do warn against multiple comparisons, but there is a tendency for researchers to consider any given comparison alone without considering it as one o</p><p>5 0.77494723 <a title="762-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-19-The_replication_and_criticism_movement_is_not_about_suppressing_speculative_research%3B_rather%2C_it%E2%80%99s_all_about_enabling_science%E2%80%99s_fabled_self-correcting_nature.html">2217 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-19-The replication and criticism movement is not about suppressing speculative research; rather, it’s all about enabling science’s fabled self-correcting nature</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  points to  a post by Alex Holcombe, who disputes the idea that science is self-correcting.  Holcombe  writes  [scroll down to get to his part]:
  
The pace of scientific production has quickened, and self-correction has suffered. Findings that might correct old results are considered less interesting than results from more original research questions. Potential corrections are also more contested. As the competition for space in prestigious journals has become increasingly frenzied, doing and publishing studies that would confirm the rapidly accumulating new discoveries, or would correct them, became a losing proposition.
  
Holcombe picks up on some points that we’ve discussed a lot here in the past year.  Here’s Holcombe:
  
In certain subfields, almost all new work appears in only a very few journals, all associated with a single professional society. There is then no way around the senior gatekeepers, who may then suppress corrections with impunity. . . .

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  reports :
  
Recently  Ben Goldacre wrote  about a group of researchers (Stuart Ritchie, Chris French, and Richard Wiseman) whose null replication of 3 experiments from the infamous Bem ESP paper was rejected by JPSP – the same journal that published Bem’s paper.
  
Srivastava recognizes that JPSP does not usually publish replications but this is a different story because it’s an anti-replication.
 
Here’s the paradox:
 
- From a scientific point of view, the Ritchie et al. results are boring.  To find out that there’s no evidence for ESP . . . that adds essentially zero to our scientific understanding.  What next, a paper demonstrating that pigeons can fly higher than chickens?  Maybe an article in the Journal of the Materials Research Society demonstrating that diamonds can scratch marble but not the reverse??
 
- But from a science-communication perspective, the null replication is a big deal because it adds credence to  my hypothesis  that the earlier ESP claims</p><p>2 0.84685689 <a title="762-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-10-Don%E2%80%99t_trust_the_Turk.html">1932 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-10-Don’t trust the Turk</a></p>

I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?


One proposal has been to fit ‘black boxes’ into cars so more individual data can be collected, as opposed to relying heavily on aggregates.

<p>Introduction: A colleague writes:
  
When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

<p>Introduction: Blogger Deep Climate  looks at  another paper by the 2002 recipient of the American Statistical Association’s Founders award. This time it’s not funny, it’s just sad. 
   
Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero. The allowance for “uphill” moves saves the method from becoming stuck at local minima—which are the bane of greedier methods.
  
And here’s Wegman:
  
During each step of the algorithm, the variable that will eventually represent the minimum is replaced by a random solution that is chosen according to a temperature</p><p>6 0.81603271 <a title="762-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-08-Gratuitous_use_of_%E2%80%9CBayesian_Statistics%2C%E2%80%9D_a_branding_issue%3F.html">133 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-08-Gratuitous use of “Bayesian Statistics,” a branding issue?</a></p>

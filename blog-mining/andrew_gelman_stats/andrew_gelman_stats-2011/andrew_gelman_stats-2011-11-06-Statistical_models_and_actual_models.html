<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>3 0.15241969 <a title="995-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-25-A_new_Bem_theory.html">1998 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-25-A new Bem theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day I was talking with someone who knows Daryl Bem a bit, and he was sharing his thoughts on that  notorious  ESP paper that was published in a leading journal in the field but then was mocked, shot down, and was repeatedly replicated with no success.  My friend said that overall the Bem paper had positive effects in forcing psychologists to think more carefully about what sorts of research results should or should not be published in top journals, the role of replications, and other things.
 
I expressed agreement and shared my thought that, at some level, I don’t think Bem himself fully believes his ESP effects are real.  Why do I say this?  Because he seemed oddly content to publish results that were not quite conclusive.  He ran a bunch of experiments, looked at the data, and computed some post-hoc p-values in the .01 to .05 range.  If he really were confident that the phenomenon was real (that is, that the results would apply to new data), then he could’ve easily run the</p><p>4 0.11598078 <a title="995-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-23-Advice_on_writing_research_articles.html">1338 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-23-Advice on writing research articles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  a few years ago :
  
Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend  rewriting both articles from scratch , using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.


4. Now go back and write the literature review</p><p>5 0.1107863 <a title="995-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-09-My_homework_success.html">896 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-09-My homework success</a></p>

You will be amused to know that students in our Bayesian Inference paper at 4th year found solutions to exercises from your book on-line.  The amazing thing was that some of them were dumb enough to copy out solutions verbatim.   However, I thought you might like to know you have done well in this class!

<p>Introduction: I’ve always thought it looked strange to see people referred to in print as Black or White rather than black or white.  For example consider this sentence:  “A black guy was walking down the street and he saw a bunch of white guys standing around.”  That looks fine, whereas “A Black guy was walking down the street and he saw a bunch of White guys standing around”—that looks weird to me, as if the encounter was taking place in an Ethnic Studies seminar.
 
But maybe I’m wrong on this.  Jay Livingston  argues  that black and white are colors whereas Black and White are races (or, as I would prefer to say, ethnic categories) and illustrates with this picture of a white person and a White person:
 
   
 
In conversation, I sometimes talk about pink people, brown people, and tan people, but that won’t work in a research paper.
 
P.S.  I suspect Carp will argue that I’m being naive:  meanings of words change across contexts and over time.

<p>Introduction: Readers of  this  bizarre story (in which a dubious claim about reflectivity of food in cooking transmuted into a flat-out wrong claim about the relevance of reflectivity of solar panels) might wonder how genius Nathan Myhrvold (Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton at age 24, postdoc with Stephen Hawking for chrissake) could make such a basic mistake.
 
In an earlier comment, I  dismissed  this with a flip allusion to Wile E. Coyote.  But now I’m thinking there’s something more going on.
 
In our blog discussion (see links above), Phil is surprised I didn’t take a stronger stance on the albedo issue after reading Pierrehumbert’s explanation.  Phil asks:  Why did I write “experts seem to think the albedo effect is a red herring” instead of something stronger such as, “as Pierrehumbert shows in detail, the albedo effect is a red herring”?
 
I didn’t do this because my physics credentials are no better than Myhrvold’s.  And, given that Myhrvold got it wrong, I don’t completely trus</p><p>4 0.7321803 <a title="995-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian_inference_for_the_parameter_of_a_uniform_distribution.html">979 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-29-Bayesian inference for the parameter of a uniform distribution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Subhash Lele writes:
  
I was wondering if you might know some good references to Bayesian treatment of parameter estimation for U(0,b) type distributions. I am looking for cases where the parameter is on the boundary. I would appreciate any help and advice you could provide. I am, in particular, looking for an MCMC (preferably in WinBUGS) based approach.  I figured out the WinBUGS part but I am still curious about the theoretical papers, asymptotics etc.
  
I actually can’t think of any examples!  But maybe you, the readers, can.
 
We also should think of the best way to implement this model in Stan.  We like to transform to avoid hard boundary constraints, but it seems a bit tacky to do a data-based transformation (which itself would not work if there are latent variables).
 
P.S.    I actually saw Lele speak at a statistics conference around 20 years ago.  There was a lively exchange between Lele and an older guy who was working on similar problems using a different method.

<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  on paid expert consulting (of the sort that I do sometime, and is common among economists and statisticians).  Hanson agrees with Keith Yost, who says:
  
Fellow consultants and associates . . . [said] fifty percent of the job is nodding your head at whatever’s being said, thirty percent of it is just sort of looking good, and the other twenty percent is raising an objection but then if you meet resistance, then dropping it.
  
On the other side is Steven Levitt, who Hanson quotes as saying:
  
My own experience has been that even though I know nothing about an industry, if you give me a week, and you get a bunch of really smart people to explain the industry to me, and to tell me what they do, a lot of times what I’ve learned in economics, what I’ve learned in other places can actually be really helpful in changing the way that they see the world.

<p>Introduction: A statistician friend reports the following conversation at a dinner party:
  
My friend:  “So what do you do?” 
A good looking fellow:  “I do modeling. What about you?” 
My friend: “Actually, I do modeling too…”
  
Which reminds me . . . on Halloween I went out trick-or-treating straight from work.  I decided to tell people I was dressed as a “dork.”  Everyone was amused.

Postdoctoral Researcher (3 years) in State-Space Modeling of Animal Movement and Population Dynamics in Universities of Turku and Helsinki, Finland


We seek for a statistician/mathematician with experience in ecological modeling or an ecologist with strong quantitative training to join an interdisciplinary research team focusing on dispersal and dynamics of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans).


The Postdoctoral Researcher will develop modeling approaches (from individual based models to population level models) to assess the dispersal and population dynamics of the flying squirrel. A key challenge will be the integration of different kinds of data (census data, telemetry data, mark-recapture data, life-history data, and data on environmental covariates such as forest structure) into the modeling framework using Bayesian State-Space models or other such approaches.


The project will be supervised by Dr. Vesa Selonen (a flying squirrel specialist;</p><p>5 0.89066815 <a title="995-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-03-%E2%80%9CDo_you_guys_pay_your_bills%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1193 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-03-“Do you guys pay your bills?”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer sends in this rejection letter from Sir David Brewster of The Edinburgh Journal of Science to Charles Babbage:
  
It is no inconsiderable degree of reluctance that I decline the offer of any Paper from you. I think, however, you will upon reconsideration of the subject be of the opinion that I have no other alternative. The subjects you propose for a series of Mathematical and Metaphysical Essays are so profound, that there is perhaps not a single subscriber to our Journal who could follow them.
  
Nowadays, he could just submit to  Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews  . . .</p><p>3 0.17361005 <a title="930-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-16-Wikipedia_author_confronts_Ed_Wegman.html">1324 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-16-Wikipedia author confronts Ed Wegman</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wegman:  “It’s not reprinted 100 percent like you had it.”
 
Wikipedia guy:  “No, you added another paragraph at the end and you changed the headline. . . . You even copied the typos that I’ve corrected on my website.  It was taken verbatim and reprinted in your paper.”
 
The original author got a  check  for $500 but, unfortunately, no free subscription to “Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics” (a $1400-$2800  value ).
 
P.S.  To those who think I’m being mean to Wegman:  I haven’t yet heard that he’s apologized to the people whose work he copied without attribution, or to the people who spent their time tracking all this down, or to the U.S. Congress for misrepresenting his expertise in his official report.
 
Everyone makes mistakes, and just about everyone has ethical lapses at times.  But when you get caught you’re supposed to make apology and restitution.</p><p>4 0.16690637 <a title="930-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-31-Why_Edit_Wikipedia%3F.html">640 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-31-Why Edit Wikipedia?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Zoe Corbyn’s article for  The Guardian  (UK), titled  Wikipedia wants more contributions from academics , and the followup  discussion on Slashdot  got me thinking about my own Wikipedia edits.  
 
The article quotes Dario Taraborelli, a research analyst for the Wikimedia Foundation, as saying “Academics are trapped in this paradox of using Wikipedia but not contributing,”  Huh?  I’m really wondering what man-in-the-street wrote all the great stats stuff out there.  And what’s the paradox?  I use lots of things without contributing to them.  
 
Taraborelli is further quoted as saying “The Wikimedia Foundation is looking at how it might capture expert conversation about Wikipedia content happening on other websites and feed it back to the community as a way of providing pointers for improvement.”
 
This struck home.  I recently went through the entry for  latent Dirichlet allocation  and found a bug in their derivation.  I wrote up a revised derivation and  posted it on my own blog .</p><p>5 0.12055205 <a title="930-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-13-My_wikipedia_edit.html">904 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-13-My wikipedia edit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day someone mentioned my complaint about the Wikipedia article on “Bayesian inference” (see footnote 1 of  this article ) and he said I should fix the Wikipedia entry myself.
 
And  so I did .  I didn’t have the energy to rewrite the whole article–in particular, all of its examples involve discrete parameters, whereas the Bayesian problems I work on generally have continuous parameters, and its “mathematical foundations” section focuses on “independent identically distributed observations x” rather than data y which can have different distributions.  It’s just a wacky, unbalanced article.  But I altered the first few paragraphs to get rid of the stuff about the posterior probability that a model is true.
 
I much prefer the  Scholarpedia article on Bayesian statistics  by David Spiegelhalter and Kenneth Rice, but I couldn’t bring myself to simply delete the Wikipedia article and replace it with the Scholarpedia content.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>3 0.68376625 <a title="930-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-27-Huh%3F.html">1915 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-27-Huh?</a></p>

Dear  Andrew Gelman


You are receiving this notice because you have published a paper with the American Journal of Public Health within the last few years. Currently, content on the Journal is closed access for the first 2 years after publication, and then freely accessible thereafter.  On June 1, 2013, the Journal will be extending its closed-access window from 2 years to 10 years. Extending this window will close public access to your article via the Journal web portal, but public access will still be available via the National Institutes of Health PubMedCentral web portal. 


If you would like to make your article available to the public for free on the Journal web portal, we are extending this limited time offer of open access at a steeply discounted rate of  $1,000 per article. If interested in purchasing this access, please contact Brian Selzer, Publications Editor, at brian.selzer@apha.org

<p>Introduction: Blogger Deep Climate  looks at  another paper by the 2002 recipient of the American Statistical Association’s Founders award. This time it’s not funny, it’s just sad. 
   
Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero.

<p>Introduction: I was pleasantly surprised to have my recreational reading about baseball in the  New Yorker  interrupted by a digression on statistics.   Sam Fuld  of the Tampa Bay Rays, was the subjet of a Ben McGrath profile in the 4 July 2011 issue of the  New Yorker , in an article titled  Super Sam .  After quoting a minor-league trainer who described Fuld as “a bit of a geek” (who isn’t these days?), McGrath gets into that lovely  New Yorker  detail:
  

One could have pointed out the more persuasive and telling examples, such as the fact that in 2005, after his first pro season, with the Class-A Peoria Chiefs, Fuld applied for a fall internship with Stats, Inc., the research firm that supplies broadcasters with much of the data anad analysis that you hear in sports telecasts.

  
After a description of what they had him doing, reviewing footage of games and cataloguing, he said
  

“I thought, They have a stat for everything, but they don’t have any stats regarding foul balls.”

<p>Introduction: Our “arm” package in R requires Doug Bates’s “lme4″ which fits multilevel models.
 
lme4 is currently having some problems on the Mac.  But installation on the Mac can be done; it just takes a bit of work.
 
I have two sets of instructions below.
  

 
From Yu-Sung:
  
If you have MAC OS DVD, you should install developer X code packages from it. Otherwise, install them from  here .


After this, do the following in R:


install.packages(“lme4″, type = “source”)


Then you will have lme4 in R and you can install arm without a problem.
  
And, from David Ozonoff:
  
I installed the lme4 package via the Package Installer but this didn’t work, of course. I then installed, via  this link , gfortran which seemed to put the libraries in the right place (I had earlier installed via Fink the gcc42 compiler, so I’m not sure if this is required or not).


I then ran, in R, this:


install.packages(c(“Matrix”,”lme4″), repos=”http://R-Forge.R-project.org”)

<p>Introduction: John Keltz writes:
  
What do you think about curved lines connecting discrete data-points?  (For example,  here .)


The problem with the smoothed graph is it seems to imply that something is going on in between the discrete data points, which is false. However, the straight-line version isn’t representing actual events either- it is just helping the eye connect each point. So maybe the curved version is also just helping the eye connect each point, and looks better doing it.


In my own work (value-added modeling of achievement test scores) I use straight lines, but I guess I am not too bothered when people use smoothing. I’d appreciate your input.
  
Regular readers will be unsurprised that, yes, I have an opinion on this one, and that this opinion is connected to some more general ideas about statistical graphics.
 
In general I’m not a fan of the curved lines.  They’re ok, but I don’t really see the point.  I can connect the dots just fine without the curves.

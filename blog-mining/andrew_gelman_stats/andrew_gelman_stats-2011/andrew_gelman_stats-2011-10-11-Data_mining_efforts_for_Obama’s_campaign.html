Data Scientist 
Position Overview


Data Scientists are responsible for providing the fundamental data science that powers our work – including predictive analytics, data mining, experimental design and ad-hoc statistical analysis.  As a Data Scientist, you will join our Chicago-based data science team, working closely and collaboratively with analysts and engineers to identify, quantify and solve big, meaningful problems. Data Scientists will have the opportunity to dive deeply into big problems and work in a variety of areas.  Civis Analytics has opportunities for applicants who are seasoned professionals, brilliant new comers, and anywhere in between.

<p>Introduction: Raphael Silberzahn writes:
  
Brian Nosek, Eric Luis Uhlmann, Dan Martin, and I just launched a project through the Open Science Center we think you’ll find interesting.


The basic idea is to “Crowdstorm a Dataset”. Multiple independent analysts are recruited to test the same hypothesis on the same data set in whatever manner they see as best. If everyone comes up with the same results, then scientists can speak with one voice. If not, the subjectivity and conditionality of results on analysis strategy is made transparent. For this first project, we are crowdstorming the question of whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players.


The full project description is  here .


If you’re interested in being one of the crowdstormer analysts, you can register  here .


All analysts will receive an author credit on the final paper. We would love to have Bayesian analysts represented in the group.

Your  recent post  on sharing data was of great interest to me, as my own research in computer science asks how to incentivize and lower barriers to data sharing.   I was particularly curious about your highlighting of effort as the major dis-incentive to sharing.  I would love to hear more, as this question of effort is on we specifically target in our development of tools for data authoring and publishing.


As a straw man, let me point out that sharing data technically requires no more than posting an excel spreadsheet online.  And that you likely already produced that spreadsheet during your own analytic work.   So, in what way does such low-tech publishing fail to meet your data sharing objectives?


Our own hypothesis has been that the effort is really quite low, with the problem being a lack of *immediate/tangible* benefits (as opposed to the long-term values you accurately describe).

 I’m helping with a  Data Science for Social Good  summer fellowship program at the University of Chicago. 
  
 The goal is to train data scientists that can tackle problems in education, healthcare, energy, transportation, and more. Working with full-time mentors from academia, industry, and the  Obama campaign , fellows will build high-impact analytics projects using statistics, machine learning, data mining, and big data technologies. 
  
 
   
 
 For fellows, we’re looking for grad students, advanced undergrads, and professionals in computer science, machine learning, statistics, and the computational and quantitative sciences. For mentors, we’re looking for folks with practical data science experience. 
  
 
   
 
 
 Fellows and mentors will be paid competitively and housed in Chicago for duration of the program, from early June to late August.

<p>Introduction: The National Climatic Data Center has  tentatively announced  that 2010 is, get this, “tied” for warmest on record.  Presumably they mean it’s tied to the precision that they quote (1.12 F above the 20th-century average). The uncertainty in the measurements, as well as some fuzziness about exactly what is being measured (how much of the atmosphere, and the oceans) makes these global-average things really suspect.  For instance, if there’s more oceanic turnover one year, that can warm the deep ocean but cool the shallow ocean and atmosphere, so even though the heat content of the atmosphere-ocean system goes up, some of these “global-average” estimates can go down. The reverse can happen too.  And of course there are various sources of natural variability that are not, these days, what most people are most interested in.  So everybody who knows about the climate professes to hate the emphasis on climate records.  And yet, they’re irresistible.  I’m sure we’ll see the usual clamor of som</p><p>3 0.93269956 <a title="951-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-17-Yes%2C_your_wish_shall_be_granted_%28in_25_years%29.html">665 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-17-Yes, your wish shall be granted (in 25 years)</a></p>

From the New York Times, 9 Sept 1981:
  
IF I COULD CHANGE PARK SLOPE


If I could change Park Slope I would turn it into a palace with queens and kings and princesses to dance the night away at the ball. The trees would look like garden stalks. The lights would look like silver pearls and the dresses would look like soft silver silk. You should see the ball. It looks so luxurious to me.


The Park Slope ball is great. Can you guess what street it’s on? “Yes. My street. That’s Carroll Street.”

<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

<p>Introduction: As I  wrote  a couple years ago:
  
Even though statistical analysis has demonstrated that presidential elections are predictable given economic conditions and previous votes in the states . . . it certainly doesn’t mean that every election can be accurately predicted ahead of time.  Presidential general election campaigns have several distinct features that distinguish them from most other elections:


1.  Two major candidates; 
2.  The candidates clearly differ in their political ideologies and in their positions on economic issues; 
3.  The two sides have roughly equal financial and organizational resources; 
4.  The current election is the latest in a long series of similar contests (every four years); 
5.  A long campaign, giving candidates a long time to present their case and giving voters a long time to make up their minds.


Other elections look different. . . .
  
Or, as I  said  in reference to the current NYC mayoral election:

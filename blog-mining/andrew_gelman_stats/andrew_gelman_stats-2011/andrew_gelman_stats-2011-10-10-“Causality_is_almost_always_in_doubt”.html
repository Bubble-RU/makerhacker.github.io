<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.

<p>Introduction: Following up on  my post  responding to his question about that controversial claim that high genetic diversity, or low genetic diversity, is bad for the economy, Kyle Peyton writes:
  
I’m happy to see you’ve articulated similar gripes I had w/ the piece, which makes me feel like I’m not crazy. I remember discussing this with colleagues (I work at a research institute w/ economists) and only a couple of them shared any concern. It seems that by virtue of being published in ‘the AER’ the results are unquestionable. I agree that the idea is interesting and worth pursuing but as you say it’s one thing to go from that to asserting ‘causality’ (I still don’t know what definition of causality they’re using?). All the data torture along the way is just tipping the hat to convention rather than serving any scientific purpose.
  
Some researchers are so uptight about identification that, when they think they have it, all their skepticism dissolves. Even in a case like this where that causal tr</p><p>4 0.14608218 <a title="950-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-More_reason_to_like_Sims_besides_just_his_name.html">952 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-More reason to like Sims besides just his name</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Horton points to  Sims ‘s  comment on Angrist and Pischke :
  
Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)
 
P.S.  I’m still miffed that this journal didn’t invite  me  to comment on that article!</p><p>5 0.14220247 <a title="950-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-15-New_prize_on_causality_in_statstistics_education.html">1624 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-15-New prize on causality in statstistics education</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judea Pearl writes:
  
Can you post the announcement below on your blog? And, by all means, if you find heresy in my interview with Ron Wasserstein, feel free to criticize it with your readers.
  
I responded that I’m not religious, so he’ll have to look for someone else if he’s looking for findings of heresy.  I did, however, want to share his announcement:
  
The American Statistical Association has announced  a new Prize , “Causality in Statistics Education”, aimed to encourage the teaching of basic causal inference in introductory statistics courses.  


The motivations for the prize are discussed in  an interview  I [Pearl] gave to Ron Wasserstein. I hope readers of this list will participate, either by innovating new tools for teaching causation or by nominating candidates who deserve the prize.

<p>Introduction: 1.   Causality and statistical learning  (Wed 12 Feb 2014, 16:00, at University of Bristol):
  
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences. There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.

This is a good one.  They laughed their asses off when I did it in Ann Arbor.  But it has serious stuff too.  As George Carlin (or, for that matter, John or Brad) might say, it’s funny because it’s true.   Here  are some old slides, but I plan to mix in a bit of new material.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  quotes  Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung on difficulties with instrumental variables.  This reminded me of some related things I’ve written.
 
In the official story the causal question comes first and then the clever researcher comes up with an IV.  I suspect that often it’s the other way around:  you find a natural experiment and look at the consequences that flow from it.  And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.  See section 4 of  this article .
 
More generally, I think economists and political scientists are currently a bit overinvested in identification strategies.  I agree with Heckman’s point (as I understand it) that ultimately we should be building models that work for us rather than always thinking we can get causal inference on the cheap, as it were, by some trick or another.  (This is a point I briefly discuss in a couple places  here  and also in my recent paper for the causality volume that Don Green etc are involved with.)

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Dave Backus writes:
  
We macroeconomists are thrilled with the Nobel prize for Sargent and Sims.  But on causality:  they spent more time showing how hard it was to identify causality than showing how to do it.  And that’s a fair assessment of our field [economics]: causality is almost always in doubt.
  
More  here .
 
If I were in a snarky mood, I’d say something like, Causality is always in doubt in economics . . . unless you’re talking about abortion and crime, in which case you can be absolutely certain.
 
But I’m in a good mood right now so I won’t say that.  Instead I’ll just remark that, as a statistician, I’m positively thrilled that somebody named “Sims” received a major award.</p><p>2 0.80133587 <a title="950-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-My_talk_at_the_University_of_Michigan_today_4pm.html">1778 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-My talk at the University of Michigan today 4pm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>3 0.7811861 <a title="950-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>5 0.77411067 <a title="950-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-10-I_guess_they_noticed_that_if_you_take_the_first_word_on_every_seventeenth_page%2C_it_spells_out_%E2%80%9CDeath_to_the_Shah%E2%80%9D.html">510 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-10-I guess they noticed that if you take the first word on every seventeenth page, it spells out “Death to the Shah”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following in email from our publisher:
  
I write with regards to the project to publish a China Edition of your book “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” (ISBN-13: 9780521686891) for the mainland Chinese market. I regret to inform you that we have been notified by our partner in China, Posts & Telecommunications Press (PTP), that due to various politically sensitive materials in the text, the China Edition has not met with the approval of the publishing authorities in China, and as such PTP will not be able to proceed with the publication of this edition. We will therefore have to cancel plans for the China Edition of your book. Please accept my apologies for this unforeseen development. If you have any queries regarding this, do feel free to let me know.

[sent-16, score-0.217]
</p><p>2 ”  I wouldn’t go quite so far as to say they don’t provide evidence, but it seems fair to say they don’t provide  convincing  or  compelling  evidence. [sent-17, score-0.221]
</p><p>3 In debates about empirical social science, there is often a tendency to simply accept descriptive claims and move straight to the arguments about their implications. [sent-21, score-0.216]
</p><p>4 But as I’ve learned in my own research, often the descriptive claims themselves should be disputed. [sent-22, score-0.216]
</p><p>5 )   So I’d like to separate Lyons’s criticism of the descriptive inferences and the causal implications. [sent-24, score-0.246]
</p><p>6 The descriptive criticism is that some of Christakis and Fowler’s observed differences are not statistically significant, thus there is some doubt about generalization to the larger population, it could all just be patterns in random noise. [sent-25, score-0.419]
</p><p>7 The causal criticism is that, if the descriptive patterns do generalize, they could be explained in other ways than contagion. [sent-26, score-0.306]
</p><p>8 In particular, he notes on page 6 that  the difference between significant and non-significant is not itself statistically significant , a point that should be familiar to regular readers of this space. [sent-29, score-0.234]
</p><p>9 Lyons goes a bit over the top in the conclusion of his article, slamming observational studies and modeling in general. [sent-34, score-0.291]
</p><p>10 But statistical modeling is important and useful in many many areas of science and engineering. [sent-35, score-0.22]

</p><p>16 Once you have good data, you might very well want to model to learn important things. [sent-67, score-0.202]
</p><p>17 Which involved lots of work, lots of interaction between the science and the data, and lots of checking. [sent-71, score-0.195]

<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points us to  a discussion in Statistics in Medicine  of the  famous claims  by Christakis and Fowler on the contagion of obesity etc.
 
 
 
 James O’Malley  and  Christakis and Fowler  present the positive case.
 
 Andrew Thomas  and  Tyler VanderWeele  present constructive criticism.
 
Christakis and Fowler  reply .
 
Coincidentally, a couple weeks ago an epidemiologist was explaining to me the differences between the Framingham Heart Study and the Nurses Health Study and why Framingham got the postmenopausal supplement risks right while Nurses got it wrong.
 
P.S.  The journal issue also includes a comment on “A distribution-free test of constant mean in linear mixed effects models.”  Wow!  I had no idea people still did this sort of thing.  How horrible.  But I guess that’s what half-life is all about.  These ideas last forever, they just become less and less relevant to people.</p><p>4 0.28533092 <a title="757-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-More_questions_on_the_contagion_of_obesity%2C_height%2C_etc..html">1412 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-More questions on the contagion of obesity, height, etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AT  discusses  [link broken; see P.P.S. below] a new paper of his that casts doubt on the robustness of the  controversial  Christakis and Fowler papers.  AT writes that he ran some simulations of contagion on social networks and found that (a) in a simple model assuming the contagion of the sort hypothesized by Christakis and Fowler, their procedure would indeed give the sorts of estimates they found in their papers, but (b) in another simple model assuming a different sort of contagion, the C&F; estimation would give indistinguishable estimates.  Thus, if you believe AT’s simulation model, C&F;’s procedure cannot statistically distinguish between two sorts of contagion (directional and simultaneous).
 
I have not looked at AT’s paper so I can’t fully comment, but I don’t fully understand his method for simulating network connections.  AT uses what he calls a “rewiring” model.  This makes sense:  as time progresses, we make new friends and lose old ones—but I am confused by the details</p><p>5 0.25758579 <a title="757-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.

<p>Introduction: Dave Backus points me to  this review  by anthropologist Mike McGovern of two books by economist Paul Collier on the politics of economic development in Africa.  My first reaction was that this was interesting but non-statistical so I’d have to either post it on the sister blog or wait until the 30 days of statistics was over.  But then I looked more carefully and realized that this discussion is very relevant to applied statistics. 
 
Here’s McGovern’s substantive critique:
  
Much of the fundamental intellectual work in Collier’s analyses is, in fact, ethnographic. Because it is not done very self-consciously and takes place within a larger econometric rhetoric in which such forms of knowledge are dismissed as “subjective” or worse still biased by the political (read “leftist”) agendas of the academics who create them, it is often ethnography of a low quality. . . .


Despite the adoption of a Naipaulian unsentimental-dispatches-from-the-trenches rhetoric, the story told in Collier’s</p><p>4 0.79750538 <a title="757-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis, a medical scientist perhaps best known for his  controversial  claim (see also  here ), based on joint work with James Fowler, that obesity is contagious,  writes : 
  
  
The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science. This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . .


I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics.

<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>2 0.99340761 <a title="757-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-13-Judea_Pearl_overview_on_causal_inference%2C_and_more_general_thoughts_on_the_reexpression_of_existing_methods_by_considering_their_implicit_assumptions.html">2170 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-13-Judea Pearl overview on causal inference, and more general thoughts on the reexpression of existing methods by considering their implicit assumptions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  material should be familiar to many of you but could be helpful to newcomers.  Pearl writes:
  
ALL causal conclusions in nonexperimental settings must be based on untested, judgmental assumptions that investigators are prepared to defend on scientific grounds. . . .


To understand what the world should be like for a given procedure to work is of no lesser scientific value than seeking evidence for how the world works . . .


Assumptions are self-destructive in their honesty. The more explicit the assumption, the more criticism it invites . . . causal diagrams invite the harshest criticism because they make assumptions more explicit and more transparent than other representation schemes.
  
As regular readers know (for example, search this blog for “Pearl”), I have not got much out of the causal-diagrams approach myself, but in general I think that when there are multiple, mathematically equivalent methods of getting the same answer, we tend to go with the framework we are used</p><p>3 0.99239069 <a title="757-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I studied math and physics at MIT. To be more precise, I started in math as default–ever since I was two years old, I’ve thought of myself as a mathematician, and I always did well in math class, so it seemed like a natural fit.
 
But I was concerned. In high school I’d been in the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad training program, and there I’d met kids who were clearly much much better at math than I was. In retrospect, I don’t think I was as bad as I’d thought at the time: there were 24 kids in the program, and I was probably around #20, if that, but I think a lot of the other kids had more practice working on “math olympiad”-type problems. Maybe I was really something like the tenth-best in the group.
 
Tenth-best or twentieth-best, whatever it was, I reached a crisis of confidence around my sophomore or junior year in college. At MIT, I started right off taking advanced math classes, and somewhere along the way I realized I wasn’t seeing the big picture. I was able to do the homework pr</p><p>5 0.99234271 <a title="757-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-21-Random_matrices_in_the_news.html">2258 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-21-Random matrices in the news</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From 2010 :
  
Mark Buchanan wrote  a cover article  for the New Scientist on random matrices, a heretofore obscure area of probability theory that his headline writer characterizes as “the deep law that shapes our reality.”


It’s interesting stuff, and he gets into some statistical applications at the end, so I’ll give you my take on it.


But first, some background.


About two hundred years ago, the mathematician/physicist Laplace discovered what is now called the central limit theorem, which is that, under certain conditions, the average of a large number of small random variables has an approximate normal (bell-shaped) distribution. A bit over 100 years ago, social scientists such as Galton applied this theorem to all sorts of biological and social phenomena. The central limit theorem, in its generality, is also important in the information that it indirectly conveys when it fails.


For example, the distribution of the heights of adult men or women is nicely bell-shaped, but the</p><p>6 0.99232042 <a title="757-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-29-We_go_to_war_with_the_data_we_have%2C_not_the_data_we_want.html">1289 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-29-We go to war with the data we have, not the data we want</a></p>

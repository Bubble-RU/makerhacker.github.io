<p>Introduction: Some recent blog discussion revealed some confusion that I’ll try to resolve here.
 
I  wrote  that I’m not a big fan of subjective priors.  Various commenters had difficulty with this point, and I think the issue was most clearly stated by Bill Jeff re erys, who  wrote :
  
It seems to me that your prior has to reflect your subjective information before you look at the data. How can it not?


But this does not mean that the (subjective) prior that you choose is irrefutable; Surely a prior that reflects prior information just does not have to be inconsistent with that information. But that still leaves a range of priors that are consistent with it, the sort of priors that one would use in a sensitivity analysis, for example.
  
I think I see what Bill is getting at.  A prior represents your subjective belief, or some approximation to your subjective belief, even if it’s not perfect.  That sounds reasonable but I don’t think it works.  Or, at least, it often doesn’t work.

<p>Introduction: Forest Gregg writes: 
  
  
I want to incorporate a prior belief into an estimation of a logistic regression classifier of points distributed in a 2d space. My prior belief is a funny kind of prior though. It’s a belief about where the decision boundary between classes should fall. Over the 2d space, I lay a grid, and I believe that a decision boundary that separates any two classes should fall along any of the grid line with some probablity, and that the decision boundary should fall anywhere except a gridline with a much lower probability.  


For the two class case, and a logistic regression model parameterized by W and data X, my prior could perhaps be expressed  


Pr(W) = (normalizing constant)/exp(d) where d = f(grid,W,X) such that when logistic(W^TX)= .5 and X is ‘far’ from grid lines, then d is large. Have you ever seen a model like this, or do you have any notions about a good avenue to pursue?

<p>Introduction: In a discussion of his variant of the write-a-thousand-words-a-day strategy (as he puts it, “a system for the production of academic results in writing”), Thomas Basbøll  writes :
  
Believe the claims you are making. That is, confine yourself to making claims you believe. I always emphasize this when I [Basbøll] define knowledge as “justified, true belief”. . . . I think if there is one sure way to undermine your sense of your own genius it is to begin to say things you know to be publishable without being sure they are true. Or even things you know to be “true” but don’t understand well enough to believe.
  
He points out that this is not so easy:
  
In times when there are strong orthodoxies it can sometimes be difficult to know what to believe. Or, rather, it is all too easy to know what to believe (what the “right belief” is). It is therefore difficult to stick to statements of one’s own belief.

<p>Introduction: I remember attending a talk a few years ago by my political science colleague John Huber in which he discussed cross-national comparisons of religious attitudes.  One thing I remember is that the U.S. is highly religious, another thing I remembered is that lots more Americans believe in heaven than believe in hell.
 
Some of this went into Red State Blue State—not the heaven/hell thing, but the graph of religiosity vs. GDP:
 
   
 
and the corresponding graph of religious attendance vs. GDP for U.S. states:
 
   
 
Also we learned that, at the individual level, the correlation of religious attendance with income is zero (according to survey reports, rich Americans are neither more nor less likely than poor Americans to go to church regularly):
 
   
 
while the correlation of prayer with income is strongly negative (poor Americans are much more likely than rich Americans to regularly pray):

<p>Introduction: Harold Pollack writes:
  
 
Over the past three years, we have experienced an amazing number of political, economic, and legislative trials. I suppose it’s human nature to respond to such events by doubling down on our own prior strongly-held beliefs. Health care reform/TARP/stimulus, whatever–that proves that I am even more right than I thought I was!


That’s really too bad. We’ve been through some hard trials recently, in multiple senses. We’ve been tested by difficult times. We’ve also had the opportunity to see many of our beliefs tested through real-world experiments that should challenge our ideological, strategic, and policy views. Anyone active and attentive should be thinking differently about _something_ important after having witnessed so much history being made so quickly on so many different fronts.

<p>Introduction: Radford  writes :
  
The word “conservative” gets used many ways, for various political purposes, but I would take it’s basic meaning to be someone who thinks there’s a lot of wisdom in traditional ways of doing things, even if we don’t understand exactly why those ways are good, so we should be reluctant to change unless we have a strong argument that some other way is better. This sounds very Bayesian, with a prior reducing the impact of new data.
  
I agree completely, and I think Radford will very much enjoy  my article with Aleks Jakulin , “Bayes: radical, liberal, or conservative?”  Radford’s comment also fits with my increasing inclination to use informative prior distributions.</p><p>4 0.68537855 <a title="721-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-19-Revised_evidence_for_statistical_standards.html">2140 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-19-Revised evidence for statistical standards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: X  and I heard about  this  much-publicized recent paper by Val Johnson, who suggests changing the default level of statistical significance from z=2 to z=3 (or, as he puts it, going from p=.05 to p=.005 or .001).  Val argues that you need to go out to 3 standard errors to get a Bayes factor of 25 or 50 in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  I don’t really buy this, first because Val’s model is a weird (to me) mixture of two point masses, which he creates in order to make a minimax argument, and second because I don’t see why you need a Bayes factor of 25 to 50 in order to make a claim.  I’d think that a factor of 5:1, say, provides strong information already—if you really believe those odds.  The real issue, as I see it, is that we’re getting Bayes factors and posterior probabilities we don’t believe, because we’re assuming flat priors that don’t really make sense.  This is a topic that’s come up over and over in recent months on this blog, for example in this discussion of why I  d</p><p>5 0.68343019 <a title="721-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-08-The_virtues_of_incoherence%3F.html">792 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-08-The virtues of incoherence?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kent Osband writes:
  
 
I just read your article  The holes in my philosophy of Bayesian data analysis . I agree on the importance of what you flagged as “comparable incoherence in all other statistical philosophies”. The problem arises when a string of unexpected observations persuades that one’s original structural hypothesis (which might be viewed as a parameter describing the type of statistical relationship) was false. 


However, I would phrase this more positively. Your Bayesian prior actually cedes alternative structural hypotheses, albeit with tiny epsilon weights. Otherwise you would never change your mind. However, these epsilons are so difficult to measure, and small differences can have such a significant impact on speed of adjustment (as in the example in Chapter 7 of Pandora’s Risk), that effectively we all look incoherent. This is a prime example of rational turbulence.

Drawing from My Mind’s Eye: 
Dorothea Rockburne in Conversation with David Cohen 
Introduced by Nina Samuel
 
Thursday, November 29 
6 pm 
BGC, 38 West 86th Street
 
Benoît Mandelbrot, unusual among mathematicians of the twentieth century, harnessed the power of visual images to express his theories and to pursue new lines of thought. In this conversation artist Dorothea Rockburne will share memories of studying with mathematician Max Dehn at Black Mountain College, of meeting Mandelbrot, and discuss her recent work.
 
Exhibition curator Nina Samuel will discuss the related exhibition “The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking,” on view in the BGC Focus Gallery through January 27, 2013.
 
  
   
David Cohen is editor and publisher of artcritical.com as well as founder and moderator of The Review Panel.

<p>Introduction: I’m a few weeks behind in my New Yorker reading and so just recently read  this fascinating article  by Ryan Lizza on the current administration’s foreign policy.  He gives some insights into the transformation Obama from antiwar candidate to a president conducting three wars.
 
Speaking as a statistician, though, what grabbed my eye was a doctrine of journalist/professor/policymaker Samantha Power.  Lizza writes:
  
In 2002, after graduating from Harvard Law School, she wrote “A Problem from Hell,” which surveyed the grim history of six genocides committed in the twentieth century. Propounding a liberal-interventionist view, Power argued that “mass killing” on the scale of Rwanda or Bosnia must be prevented by other nations, including the United States. She wrote that America and its allies rarely have perfect information about when a regime is about to commit genocide; a President, therefore, must have “a bias toward belief” that massacres are imminent.

<p>Introduction: I opened the paper today and saw  this  from Paul Krugman, on
  
Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, who posted an assertion on Twitter that the [recent unemployment data] had been cooked to help President Obama’s re-election campaign. His claim was quickly picked up by right-wing pundits and media personalities.


It was nonsense, of course. Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees. But then maybe Mr. Welch — under whose leadership G.E. reported remarkably smooth earnings growth, with none of the short-term fluctuations you might have expected (fluctuations that reappeared under his successor) — doesn’t know how hard it would be to cook the jobs data.
  
I was curious so I googled *general electric historical earnings*.  It was surprisingly difficult to find the numbers!  Most of the links just went back to 2011, or to 2008.  Eventually I came across  this blog  by Barry Ritholtz that showed this</p><p>5 0.85756731 <a title="721-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-21-%E2%80%9CHow_segregated_is_your_city%3F%E2%80%9D%3A__A_story_of_why_every_graph%2C_no_matter_how_clear_it_seems_to_be%2C_needs_a_caption_to_anchor_the_reader_in_some_numbers.html">289 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-21-“How segregated is your city?”:  A story of why every graph, no matter how clear it seems to be, needs a caption to anchor the reader in some numbers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aleks points me to  this article  showing some pretty maps by Eric Fisher showing where people of different ethnicity live within several metro areas within the U.S.  The idea is simple but effective; in the words of Cliff Kuang:
  
Fisher used a straight forward method borrowed from Rankin: Using U.S. Census data from 2000, he created a map where one dot equals 25 people. The dots are then color-coded based on race: White is pink; Black is blue; Hispanic is orange, and Asian is green.






The results for various cities are fascinating: Just like every city is different, every city is integrated (or segregated) in different ways. 
  
New York is shown below.
 
 No, San Francisco is not “very, very white” 
 
But I worry that these maps are difficult for non-experts to read.  For example, Kuang writes the following::
  
San Francisco proper is very, very white.
  
This is an understandable mistake coming from someone who, I assume, has never lived in the Bay Area.  But what’s amazing i</p><p>6 0.85020661 <a title="721-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-03-Somebody_listened_to_me%21.html">1603 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-03-Somebody listened to me!</a></p>

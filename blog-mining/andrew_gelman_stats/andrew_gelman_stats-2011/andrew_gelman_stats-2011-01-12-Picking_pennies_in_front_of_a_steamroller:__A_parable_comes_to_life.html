<p>Introduction: I was thinking more about David Brooks’s  anti-data column  from yesterday, and I realized what is really bothering me.
 
Brooks expresses skepticism about numbers, about the limitations of raw data, about the importance of human thinking.  Fine, I agree with all of this, to some extent.
 
But then Brooks turns around uses numbers and unquestioningly and uncritically (OK, not completely uncritically; see P.S. below).  In a  notorious  recent case, Brooks wrote, in the context of college admissions:
  
You’re going to want to argue with Unz’s article all the way along, especially for its narrow, math-test-driven view of merit. But it’s potentially ground-shifting. Unz’s other big point is that Jews are vastly overrepresented at elite universities and that Jewish achievement has collapsed. In the 1970s, for example, 40 percent of top scorers in the Math Olympiad had Jewish names. Now 2.5 percent do.
  
But these numbers are incorrect, as I learned from a professor of oncology at the Univ</p><p>6 0.084548987 <a title="512-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-03-Taleb_%2B_3.5_years.html">392 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-03-Taleb + 3.5 years</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Every time I hear  this  sort of story:
  
Morrone—listed at 48 years old, which would have made her the oldest Olympic cross-country skier of all time by seven years—didn’t even show up for the 10K women’s classic on Feb. 13, claiming injury. (She was the only one of the race’s 76 entrants who didn’t start.) A day later, in the 15K men’s classic, di Silvestri, 47, made it out of the starting gate but gave up just a few hundred meters later, claiming illness. He was reportedly the only starter who failed to make even the first checkpoint.
  
I think about my cousin  Bill .
 
At least when Bill skied in the winter olympics a bunch of years ago as part of the Puerto Rican team, he finished.  OK, he finished last, but  somebody  had to finish last.  At least he skied down the whole damn slope.
 
P.S.  I have no idea how Puerto Rico was allowed to have an olympic team.  As you might have heard, it’s not actually a country.

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.

<p>Introduction: Chapter 1 
 
On Sunday we were over on 125 St so I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Jesus Taco was next door so I went there instead.  What a mistake!  I don’t know what Masanao and Yu-Sung could’ve been thinking.  Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn’t impress me).  I’m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I’m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn’t tell anyone.  I can’t really figure out why I’m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.  It’s a good deal:  they’re small but not that small.  Sure, I ate 6 of them, but I was hungry.

<p>Introduction: Mickey Kaus does a public service by  trashing  Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics are local.”  As Kaus point out, all the congressional elections in recent decades have been nationalized.
 
I’d go one step further and say that, sure, all politics are local–if you’re Tip O’Neill and represent a ironclad Democratic seat in Congress.  It’s easy to be smug about your political skills if you’re in a safe seat and have enough pull in state politics to avoid your district getting gerrymandered.  Then you can sit there and sagely attribute your success to your continuing mastery of local politics rather than to whatever it took to get the seat in the first place.</p><p>4 0.59807491 <a title="512-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.
  
Assuming this story is accurate, I guess they don’t have one of those “three strikes” laws in Massachusetts?  Personally, I’m a lot more afraid of a dangerous driver than of some drug dealer.  I’d think a simple cost-benefit calculation would recommend taking away</p><p>5 0.55993891 <a title="512-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-Defining_ourselves_arbitrarily.html">1411 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-Defining ourselves arbitrarily</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robin Hanson  writes  that he does’t use slang:
  
I [Hanson] am not into slang. I want to talk to the widest possible audience, and to focus on timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics. I can see why people want to signal loyalty to their groups, especially in the military, but I have little confidence that this is good for the world as a whole.
  
I don’t know anything about the military (I don’t think  this  really counts) so I can’t comment on that part, and I don’t see the opposition between slang and “timeless issues and insights, as opposed to the latest fashionable topics” (after all, Mark Twain used slang and he had some timeless insights), but I’d like to pick up on a slightly different angle here, which is the set of quasi-arbitrary choices we make in order to define ourselves.
 
Robin Hanson happens not to use much slang and he uses this trait to define himself, not quite to stand out in the crowd but to put himself on one end of a scale.

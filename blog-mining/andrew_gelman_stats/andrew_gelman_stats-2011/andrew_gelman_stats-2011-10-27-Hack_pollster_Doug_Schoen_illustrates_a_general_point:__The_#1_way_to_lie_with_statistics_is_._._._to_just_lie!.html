<h1>977 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-27-Hack pollster Doug Schoen illustrates a general point:  The #1 way to lie with statistics is . . . to just lie!</h1>

The culprit is pollster Doug Schoen, and  the catch  was made by Jay Livingston.  Schoen wrote the following based on a survey he took of Occupy Wall Street participants:

</p><p>8 Our research shows clearly that the movement doesn’t represent unemployed America and is not ideologically diverse. [sent-10, score-0.154]
</p><p>9 Rather, it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence. [sent-11, score-0.486]
</p><p>10 Unfortunately for Schoen, he made the mistake of sharing his data with Azi Paybarah, who  posted  the raw numbers:    What would you like to see the Occupy Wall Street movement achieve? [sent-15, score-0.151]
</p><p>11 Here is Schoen in the WSJ:    Sixty-five percent say that government has a moral responsibility to guarantee all citizens access to affordable health care, a college education, and a secure retirement—no matter the cost. [sent-17, score-0.592]
</p><p>12 Here is the actual question:    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Government has a moral responsibility to guarantee healthcare, college education, and a secure retirement for all. [sent-18, score-0.464]
</p><p>13 As careful survey researchers know, even slight changes in wording can affect responses. [sent-20, score-0.357]
</p><p>14 And including or omitting “no matter the cost” is hardly a slight change. [sent-21, score-0.182]
</p><p>15 As evidence for the extreme radicalism of the protestors, Schoen says,    By a large margin (77%-22%), they support raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans,    Schoen doesn’t bother to mention that this isn’t much different from what you’d find outside Zucotti Park. [sent-22, score-0.506]
</p><p>16 Recent polls by Pew and Gallup find support for increased taxes on the wealthy ($250,000 or more) at 67%. [sent-23, score-0.196]

</p><p>18 I could be charitable and label these last two errors as accidental:  perhaps Schoen is so out of it that he did not actually realize that most Americans support higher taxes on the rich, and perhaps he did not bother to read the wording of his own survey item on health care attitudes. [sent-26, score-0.754]
</p><p>19 But the first mistake—labeling the group as supporting “radical redistribution of wealth” when  his own survey  reported only 4% with that opinion—that’s just flat-out unethical. [sent-27, score-0.315]

<p>Introduction: According to  Chris Wilson , there are two versions of the report of the Occupy Wall Street poll from  so-called  hack pollster Doug Schoen.
 
 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.

In your  review  of the Jacobs and Page book, you argued that while there was an open question of whether government could give voters what they wanted in light of the tax increases they might accept, Jacobs and Page were pretty persuasive about targeted tax hikes and specific programs especially against the freeloader view.  Recent discussions, and some focus groups  bear out these points exactly.

<p>Introduction: Leslie McCall spoke in the sociology department here the other day to discuss changes in attitudes about income inequality as well as changes in attitudes about attitudes about income inequality.  (That is, she talked about what survey respondents say, and she talked about what scholars have said about what survey respondents say.)
 
On the plus side, the talk was interesting.  On the downside, I had to leave right at the start of the discussion so I didn’t have a chance to ask my questions.  So I’m placing them below.
 
I can’t find a copy of McCall’s slides so I’ll link to  this recent op-ed  she wrote on the topic of “Rising Wealth Inequality: Should We Care?”  Her title was “Americans Aren’t Naive,” and she wrote:
  
Understanding what Americans think about rising income inequality has been hampered by three problems.

The parenting club Bounty, which distributes their packs through midwives, hospitals, and large UK supermarket and pharmacy chains, commissioned a  fun little survey for Halloween from the company  OnePoll .

(One does wonder how a parenting club with such close links to the UK National Health Service thought a survey on this topic was at all appropriate, but that’s another rant.)


So far, so awful, but what I [Wolters] thought might grab your attention was the excuse OnePoll offered for their work in their email to Petra. (Petra is very well known in the UK, and so was able to get a statement from the polling company.) Here it is in its full glory, taken from Petra’s post:

<p>Introduction: From my  New York Times blog  today, here’s an example of how contemporaneous poll results can be given exactly opposite interpretations.
 
Recently in the New Republic,  William Galston  shared some recent findings from Gallup:
  
Respondents were asked to categorize three economic objectives as extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not important. Here’s what they said:


Extremely/very important          Somewhat/not important


Grow and expand the economy                                         82                                            18


Increase equality of opportunity for people to get ahead                                             70                                            30


Reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and the poor                                  46                                            54

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>5 0.73846197 <a title="977-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-18-American_Beliefs_about_Economic_Opportunity_and_Income_Inequality.html">666 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-18-American Beliefs about Economic Opportunity and Income Inequality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Leslie McCall spoke in the sociology department here the other day to discuss changes in attitudes about income inequality as well as changes in attitudes about attitudes about income inequality.  (That is, she talked about what survey respondents say, and she talked about what scholars have said about what survey respondents say.)
 
On the plus side, the talk was interesting.  On the downside, I had to leave right at the start of the discussion so I didn’t have a chance to ask my questions.  So I’m placing them below.
 
I can’t find a copy of McCall’s slides so I’ll link to  this recent op-ed  she wrote on the topic of “Rising Wealth Inequality: Should We Care?”  Her title was “Americans Aren’t Naive,” and she wrote:
  
Understanding what Americans think about rising income inequality has been hampered by three problems.


First, polls rarely ask specifically about income inequality. They ask instead about government redistributive polices, such as taxes and welfare, which are not alw</p><p>6 0.73188883 <a title="977-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-10-Do_you_believe_that_%E2%80%9Chumans_and_other_living_things_have_evolved_over_time%E2%80%9D%3F.html">2167 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-10-Do you believe that “humans and other living things have evolved over time”?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Everybody knows how you can lie with statistics by manipulating numbers, making inappropriate comparisons, misleading graphs, etc.  But, as I like to remind students, the simplest way to lie with statistics is to just lie!  You see this all the time, advocates who make up numbers or present numbers with such little justification that they might as well be made up (as in  this  purported survey of the “super-rich”).
 
Here I’m not talking about the  innumeracy  of a Samantha Power or  a  David Runciman, or Michael Barone-style  confusion  or Gregg Easterbrook-style  cluelessness  or even Tucker Carlson-style  asininity .  No, I’m talking about flat-out lying by a professional who has the numbers and deliberately chooses to misrepresent them.
 
The culprit is pollster Doug Schoen, and  the catch  was made by Jay Livingston.  Schoen wrote the following based on a survey he took of Occupy Wall Street participants:

<p>Introduction: I was reading  this article  by Ariel Levy in the New Yorker and noticed something suspicious.  Levy was writing about an event in 1979 and then continued:
  
One year later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency, with overwhelming support from evangelicals. The evangelical vote has been a serious consideration in every election since.
  
From Chapter 6 of  Red State, Blue State :
 
 
 
According to the National Election Study, Reagan did quite a bit  worse   than Carter  among evangelical Protestants than among voters as a whole–no surprise, really, given that Reagan was not particularly religious and Cater was an evangelical himself.
 
It was 1992, not 1980, when evangelicals really started to vote Republican.
 
 What’s it all about? 
 
I wouldn’t really blame Ariel Levy for this mistake; a glance at her  website  reveals a lot of experience as a writer and culture reporter but not much on statistics or politics.  That’s fine by me:  there’s a reason I subscribe to the New Yorker and not</p><p>3 0.93825656 <a title="977-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-John_McPhee%2C_the_Anti-Malcolm.html">203 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-John McPhee, the Anti-Malcolm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This blog is threatening to turn into Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, Social Science, and Literature Criticism, but I’m just going to go with the conversational flow, so here’s another post about an essayist.  
 
I’m not a big fan of Janet Malcolm’s essays — and I don’t mean I don’t like her attitude or her pro-murderer attitude, I mean I don’t like them all that much as writing.  They’re fine, I read them, they don’t bore me, but I certainly don’t think she’s “our” best essayist.  But that’s not a debate I want to have right now, and if I did I’m quite sure most of you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.  So instead, I’ll just say something about John McPhee. 
 
As all right-thinking people agree, in McPhee’s long career he has written two kinds of books: good, short books, and bad, long books.  (He has also written many New Yorker essays, and perhaps other essays for other magazines too; most of these are good, although I haven’t seen any really good recent work from him, and so</p><p>4 0.93046176 <a title="977-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project_qualifying_exam_process%3A__An_intensified_dialogue_between_students_and_faculty.html">308 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-30-Nano-project qualifying exam process:  An intensified dialogue between students and faculty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>5 0.92931497 <a title="977-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-09-Experimental_work_on_market-based_or_non-market-based_incentives.html">1410 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-09-Experimental work on market-based or non-market-based incentives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Patterson writes:
  
I found  a discussion  at the Boston Review that I thought you’d be interested in, given your posts on the potentially dubious foundations of many neoclassical economics models.


Michael Sandel cites a few examples of markets crowding out moral behavior.  His longest discussion regards Frey and Oberholzer-Gee’s work demonstrating Swiss citizens’ willingness to admit a nuclear waste facility to town  decreasing  when offered monetary incentives.  It seems like this is a situation that really demands a discussion of the available empirical evidence (Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini have two papers, “Pay Enough or Don’t Pay At All” and “A Fine is a Price” that seem especially relevant.)


While the essay has sparked the usual sort of libertarian response, I’m struck by the fact that most people aren’t talking about the experimental work that’s actually available—it seems like this is the best way forward.

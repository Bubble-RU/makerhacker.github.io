</p><p>15 Here’s the quick summary, which (I think) both Bartels and Campbell would agree with:   - On average, the economy did a lot better under Democratic than Republican presidents in the first two years of the term. [sent-23, score-0.594]
</p><p>16 - On average, the economy did slightly better under Republican than Democratic presidents in years 3 and 4. [sent-24, score-0.594]

</p><p>18 Under the Bartels story, voters are myopically chasing short-term trends, whereas in Campbell’s version, voters are correctly picking up on the second derivative (that is, the trend in the change of the GNP from beginning to end of the term). [sent-27, score-0.395]

<p>Introduction: A lot of people are asking, How could the voters have swung so much in two years?  And, why didn’t Obama give Americans a better sense of his long-term economic plan in 2009, back when he still had a political mandate?  As an academic statistician and political scientist, I have no insight into the administration’s internal deliberations, but I have some thoughts based on my interpretation of political science research.
 
 The baseline 
 
As  Doug Hibbs  and others have pointed out, given the Democrats’ existing large majority in both houses of Congress and the continuing economic depression, we’d expect a big Republican swing in the vote.  And this has been echoed for a long time in the polls–as early as September, 2009–over a year before the election–political scientists were forecasting that the Democrats were going to lose big in the midterms.  (The polls have made it clear that most voters do  not  believe the Republican Party has the answer either.

<p>Introduction: Zach Shahn saw  this  and writes:
  
I just heard  a talk by Peter Bartlett  about model selection in “unlimited” data situations that essentially addresses this curve.


He talks about the problem of model selection given a computational budget (rather than given a sample size). You can either use your computational budget to get more data or fit a more complex model. He shows that you can get oracle inequalities for model selection algorithms under this paradigm (as long as the candidate models are nested).
  
I can’t follow all the details but it looks cool!  This is what they should be teaching in theoretical statistics class, instead of sufficient statistics and the Neyman-Pearson lemma and all that other old stuff.
 
Zach also asks:
  
I have a question about political science.  I always hear that the direction of the economy is one of the best predictors of election outcome.  What’s your thinking about the causal mechanism(s) behind the success of economic trend indicators as pr</p><p>4 0.22650087 <a title="659-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-20-Are_the_Democrats_avoiding_a_national_campaign%3F.html">286 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-20-Are the Democrats avoiding a national campaign?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Frank Newport of Gallup  reports  ( link  from Jay Livingston):
  
Americans become progressively less positive about economic conditions the farther away from home they look. Forty-nine percent rate economic conditions in their local area as excellent or good, but that drops to 25% when rating the U.S. economy, and to 13% when assessing the world as a whole.
  
This is really wack:
 
   
 
I can see how it might make sense for Americans to think conditions are worse in other countries, but it’s hard to see a rational reason for the Lake-Wobegon-like pattern of people thinking things are ok locally but not nationally.
 
Gallup highlights the partisan breakdown, which I graphed here:
 
   
 
Unsurprisingly (given that their party controls the presidency and one house of Congress), Democrats are more optimistic than Republicans.

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>5 0.86702776 <a title="659-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-31-Two_stories_about_the_election_that_I_don%E2%80%99t_believe.html">384 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-31-Two stories about the election that I don’t believe</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t exactly disagree with the two arguments that I reproduce below, but I think they miss the point.
 
 Is “the battle over elitism” really central to this election? 
 
First, the easy one.   Peter Baker  in the New York Times, under the heading, “Elitism: The Charge That Obama Can’t Shake”:
  
For all the discussion of health care and spending and jobs, at the core of the nation’s debate this fall has been the battle of elitism. . . . Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama had not connected with popular discontent. “A lot of people have never been to Washington or New York, and they feel people there are so out of touch,” he said. . . . Rather than entertaining the possibility that the program they have pursued is genuinely and even legitimately unpopular, the White House and its allies have concluded that their political troubles amount to mainly a message and image problem.
  
I think this is misleading for the usual reason that these message-oriented critiques are</p><p>6 0.84780276 <a title="659-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-14-Is_it_1930%3F.html">84 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-14-Is it 1930?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>2 0.97119272 <a title="659-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-22-Please_stop_me_before_I_barf_again.html">1275 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-22-Please stop me before I barf again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing  to some horrible graphs, Kaiser writes, “The Earth Institute needs a graphics adviser.”
 
   
 
I agree.  The graphs are corporate standard, neither pretty or innovative enough to qualify as infographics, not informational enough to be good statistical data displays.
 
Some examples include the above exploding pie chart, which, as Kaiser notes, is not merely ugly and ridiculously difficult to read (given that it is conveying only nine data points) but also invites suspicion of its numbers, and pages and pages of graphs that could be better compressed into a compact displays (see pages 25-65 of the report).  Yes, this is all better than tables of numbers, but I don’t see that much thought went into displaying patterns of information or telling a story.  It’s more graph-as-data-dump.
 
To be fair, the report does have some a clean scatterplot (on page 65).  But, overall, the graphs are not well-integrated with the messages in the text.

I asked the IMS people for an expert in statistics of voting/elections and they wrote me your name. I am a statistician, but never worked in the field voting/elections. It was my son-in-law who asked me for statistical theories in that field.


He posed in particular the following problem:


The aim of the voting is to come to a ranking of c candidates. Every vote is a permutation of these c candidates. The problem is to have probability distributions in the set of all permutations of c elements.


Are there theories for such distributions?


I should be very grateful for a fast answer with hints to literature. (I confess that I do not know your books.) 
 

 
My reply:  Rather than trying to model the ranks directly, Iâ&euro;&trade;d recommend modeling a latent continuous outcome which then implies a distribution on ranks, if the ranks are of interest. There are lots of distributions of c-dimensional continuous outcomes.

<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice.

<p>Introduction: Postdoc #1. Hierarchical Modeling and Computation: We are fitting hierarchical regression models with deep interactions. We’re working on new models with structured prior distributions, and this also requires advances in Bayesian computation. Applications include public opinion, climate reconstruction, and education research.
 
Postdoc #1 is funded by grants from the Department of Energy, Institute of Education Sciences, and National Science Foundation.
 
Postdoc #2. Hierarchical Modeling and Statistical Graphics: The goal of this research program is to investigate the application of the latest methods of multi-level data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem: forecasting retail sales at the individual item level.

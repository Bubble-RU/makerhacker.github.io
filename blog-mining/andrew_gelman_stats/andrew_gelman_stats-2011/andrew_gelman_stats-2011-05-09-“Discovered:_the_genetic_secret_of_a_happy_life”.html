<p>Introduction: As part of my continuing research project with Grazia and Roberto, I’ve been reading papers on happiness and life satisfaction research.  I’ll share with you my thoughts on some of the published work in this area.
  

 
Alberto Alesina,, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch published  a paper  in 2004 called “Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?”:
  
We study the effect of the level of inequality in society on individual well-being using a total of 123,668 answers to a survey question about “happiness.” We find that individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high, even after controlling for individual income, a large set of personal characteristics, and year and country (or, in the case of the US, state) dummies. The effect, however, is more precisely defined statistically in Europe than in the US. In addition, we find striking differences across groups. In Europe, the poor and those on the left of the political spectru</p><p>4 0.14657965 <a title="702-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-28-Question_18_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1349 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-28-Question 18 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 18. A survey is taken of 100 undergraduates, 100 graduate students, and 100 continuing education students at a university. Assume a simple random sample within each group. Each student is asked to rate his or her satisfaction (on a 1–10 scale) with his or her experiences. Write the estimate and standard error of the average satisfaction of all the students at the university. Introduce notation as necessary for all the information needed to solve the problem.
 
 Solution to question 17 
 
From  yesterday :
  
17. In a survey of n people, half are asked if they support “the health care law recently passed by Congress” and half are asked if they support “the law known as Obamacare.” The goal is to estimate the effect of the wording on the proportion of Yes responses. How large must n be for the effect to be estimated within a standard error of 5 percentage points?
  
Solution:  se is sqrt(.5*.5/(n/2)+.5*.5/(n/2)) = 1/sqrt(n).  Solve 1/sqrt(n) = .05, you get n = (1/.05)^2 = 400.</p><p>5 0.1445353 <a title="702-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-18-Economic_Disparities_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_European_Regions.html">97 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-18-Economic Disparities and Life Satisfaction in European Regions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Grazia Pittau, Roberto Zelli, and I came out with  a paper  investigating the role of economic variables in predicting regional disparities in reported life satisfaction of European Union citizens.  We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents within regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions.  Here’s what we found:
 
- Personal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same country.
 
- Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living in high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work.
 
- After controlling for individual characteristics and modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain.

<p>Introduction: Thomas Lumley  writes :
  
 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>4 0.75519675 <a title="702-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-01-%E2%80%9CThough_They_May_Be_Unaware%2C_Newlyweds_Implicitly_Know_Whether_Their_Marriage_Will_Be_Satisfying%E2%80%9D.html">2156 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-01-“Though They May Be Unaware, Newlyweds Implicitly Know Whether Their Marriage Will Be Satisfying”</a></p>

 The article , with the admirably clear title given above, is by James McNulty, Michael Olson, Andrea Meltzer, Matthew Shaffer, and begins as follows:
  
For decades, social psychological theories have posited that the automatic processes captured by implicit measures have implications for social outcomes. Yet few studies have demonstrated any long-term implications of automatic processes, and some scholars have begun to question the relevance and even the validity of these theories. At baseline of our longitudinal study, 135 newlywed couples (270 individuals) completed an explicit measure of their conscious attitudes toward their relationship and an implicit measure of their automatic attitudes toward their partner. They then reported their marital satisfaction every 6 months for the next 4 years.

I have read an  article  on NPR and the  journal article  that spun this news.  


What draw my attention was the discussion in terms of causation implied by one of the authors of the article interviewed in the NPR news, and also by the conclusions of the article itself claiming large effects.


Although the total sample (self-selecting pregnant women) seems very large (85,176) the subsamples (270 out of which 114 were in the sub-subsample revealing statistically significant association) used to support the analysis seem to be too small. Or not?

<p>Introduction: I took the above headline from  a news article  in the (London) Independent by Jeremy Laurance reporting a study by Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, James Fowler, and Bruno Frey that reportedly just appeared in the Journal of Human Genetics.
 
One of the pleasures of blogging is that I can go beyond the usual journalistic approaches to such a story:  (a) puffing it, (b) debunking it, (c) reporting it completely flatly.  Even convex combinations of (a), (b), (c) do not allow what I’d like to do, which is to explore the claims and follow wherever my exploration takes me.  (And one of the pleasures of building my own audience is that I don’t need to endlessly explain background detail as was needed on a general-public site such as 538.)
 
OK, back to the genetic secret of a happy life.  Or, in the words the authors of the study, a gene that “explains less than one percent of the variation in life satisfaction.”
 
 “The genetic secret” or “less than one percent of the variation”?

<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.

<p>Introduction: Faithful readers will know that my ideal alternative career is to be an editor in the Max Perkins mold.  If not that, I think I’d enjoy being a literary essayist, someone like Alfred Kazin or Edmund Wilson or Louis Menand, who could write about my favorite authors and books in a forum where others would read and discuss what I wrote.  I could occasionally collect my articles into books, and so on.  On the other hand, if I actually had such a career, I wouldn’t have much of an option to do statistical research in my spare time, so I think for my own broader goals, I’ve gotten hold of the right side of the stick.
 
As it is, I enjoy writing about literary matters but it never quite seems worth spending the time to do it right.  (And, stepping outside myself, I realize that I have a lot more to offer the world as a statistician than literary critic.  Criticism is like musicianship–it can be hard to do, and it’s impressive when done well, but a lot of people can do it.

<p>Introduction: When we suggest a new method, we are duty-bound to not just demonstrate that it works better than existing approaches (or is superior in some other way such as simplicity or cost).  We also need to explain why, if this new method is so great, people aren’t  already  using it.
 
Various answers are possible, for example:
 
- The new idea is technically advanced, requiring a level of mathematical or engineering complexity such that it could not easily have been discovered by accident.  Hence its novelty can be explained as a product of some particular historical process.
 
- The new idea is clever and unexpected, as with the mechanical device underlying Rubik’s Cube.
 
- The new idea could only exist given recent technological developments (perhaps hardware developments such as a new composite material or an ultralight battery, or software developments such as a new MCMC algorithm).
 
- The new idea usually isn’t so impressive but it shows its virtues in some previously hidden domain (fo</p><p>5 0.97335386 <a title="702-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-05-Xiao-Li_Meng_and_Xianchao_Xie_rethink_asymptotics.html">1406 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-05-Xiao-Li Meng and Xianchao Xie rethink asymptotics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  an article  catchily entitled, “I got more data, my model is more refined, but my estimator is getting worse!  Am I just dumb?”, Meng and Xie write:
  
Possibly, but more likely you are merely a victim of conventional wisdom. More data or better models by no means guarantee better estimators (e.g., with a smaller mean squared error), when you are not following probabilistically principled methods such as MLE (for large samples) or Bayesian approaches. Estimating equations are par- ticularly vulnerable in this regard, almost a necessary price for their robustness. These points will be demonstrated via common tasks of estimating regression parameters and correlations, under simple mod- els such as bivariate normal and ARCH(1). Some general strategies for detecting and avoiding such pitfalls are suggested, including checking for self-efficiency (Meng, 1994, Statistical Science) and adopting a guiding working model.

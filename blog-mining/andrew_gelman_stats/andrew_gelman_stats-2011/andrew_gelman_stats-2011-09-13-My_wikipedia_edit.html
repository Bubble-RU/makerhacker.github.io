And  so I did .

<p>Introduction: Zoe Corbyn’s article for  The Guardian  (UK), titled  Wikipedia wants more contributions from academics , and the followup  discussion on Slashdot  got me thinking about my own Wikipedia edits.  
 
The article quotes Dario Taraborelli, a research analyst for the Wikimedia Foundation, as saying “Academics are trapped in this paradox of using Wikipedia but not contributing,”  Huh?  I’m really wondering what man-in-the-street wrote all the great stats stuff out there.  And what’s the paradox?  I use lots of things without contributing to them.  
 
Taraborelli is further quoted as saying “The Wikimedia Foundation is looking at how it might capture expert conversation about Wikipedia content happening on other websites and feed it back to the community as a way of providing pointers for improvement.”
 
This struck home.  I recently went through the entry for  latent Dirichlet allocation  and found a bug in their derivation.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo  collected  some reactions to my recent  article , Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
I’m pleased that that everybody (philosopher Mayo, applied statistician Stephen Senn, and theoretical statistician Larry Wasserman) is so positive about my article and that nobody’s defending the sort of hard-core inductivism that’s featured on the Bayesian inference wikipedia page.  Here’s the Wikipedia definition, which I  disagree  with:
  
Bayesian inference uses aspects of the scientific method, which involves collecting evidence that is meant to be consistent or inconsistent with a given hypothesis. As evidence accumulates, the degree of belief in a hypothesis ought to change. With enough evidence, it should become very high or very low. . . . Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been obse</p><p>5 0.13640636 <a title="904-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Jelte_Wicherts_lays_down_the_stats_on_IQ.html">6 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Jelte Wicherts lays down the stats on IQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Updated version  of my paper with Xian:
  
The missionary zeal of many Bayesians of old has been matched, in the other direction, by an attitude among some theoreticians that Bayesian methods are absurd—not merely misguided but obviously wrong in principle. We consider several examples, beginning with Feller’s classic text on probability theory and continuing with more recent cases such as the perceived Bayesian nature of the so-called doomsday argument. We analyze in this note the intellectual background behind various misconceptions about Bayesian statistics, without aiming at a complete historical coverage of the reasons for this dismissal.

<p>Introduction: Xian and I respond to the four discussants of our paper, “Not only defended but also applied”: The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference.”  Here’s the abstract of  our rejoinder :
  
Over the years we have often felt frustration, both at smug Bayesians—in particular, those who object to checking of the fit of model to data, either because all Bayesian models are held to be subjective and thus unquestioned (an odd combination indeed, but that is the subject of another article)—and angry anti-Bayesians who, as we wrote in our article, strain on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood. The present article arose from our memory of a particularly intemperate anti-Bayesian statement that appeared in Feller’s beautiful and classic book on probability theory. We felt that it was worth exploring the very extremeness of Feller’s words, along with similar anti-Bayesian remarks by others, in order to better understand the background underlying contr</p><p>4 0.80067259 <a title="904-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-18-Those_wacky_anti-Bayesians_used_to_be_intimidating%2C_but_now_they%E2%80%99re_just_pathetic.html">2254 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-18-Those wacky anti-Bayesians used to be intimidating, but now they’re just pathetic</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
Eric Archer forwarded  this document  by Nick Freemantle, “The Reverend Bayes—was he really a prophet?”, in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine:

 

Does [Bayes's] contribution merit the enthusiasms of his followers? Or is his legacy overhyped? . . .


First, Bayesians appear to have an absolute right to disapprove of any conventional approach in statistics without offering a workable alternative—for example, a colleague recently stated at a meeting that ‘. . . it is OK to have multiple comparisons because Bayesians’ don’t believe in alpha spending’. . . .


Second, Bayesians appear to build an army of straw men—everything it seems is different and better from a Bayesian perspective, although many of the concepts seem remarkably familiar. For example, a very well known Bayesian statistician recently surprised the audience with his discovery of the P value as a useful Bayesian statistic at a meeting in Birmingham.


Third, Bayesians possess enormous enthusiasm fo</p><p>5 0.79912323 <a title="904-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-29-Ya_don%E2%80%99t_know_Bayes%2C_Jack.html">117 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-29-Ya don’t know Bayes, Jack</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  this article  on the philosophy of statistics by University of Michigan economist John DiNardo.  I don’t have much to say about the substance of the article because most of it is an argument against something called “Bayesian methods” that doesn’t have much in common with the Bayesian data analysis that I do.
 
If an quantitative, empirically-minded economist at a top university doesn’t know about modern Bayesian methods, then it’s a pretty good guess that confusion holds in many other quarters as well, so I thought I’d try to clear a couple of things up.  (See also  here .)
 
In the short term, I know I have some readers at the University of Michigan, so maybe a couple of you could go over to Prof. DiNardo’s office and discuss this with him?  For the rest of you, please spread the word.
 
My point here is not to claim that DiNardo  should  be using Bayesian methods or to claim that he’s doing anything wrong in his applied work.  It’s just that he’s fighting against a bu</p><p>6 0.78813982 <a title="904-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-11-How_things_sound_to_us%2C_versus_how_they_sound_to_others.html">1259 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-11-How things sound to us, versus how they sound to others</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Anthropologist Bruce Mannheim  reports  that a recent well-publicized study on the genetics of native Americans, which used genetic analysis to find “at least three streams of Asian gene flow,” is in fact a confirmation of a long-known fact.  Mannheim writes:
  
This three-way distinction was known linguistically since the 1920s (for example, Sapir 1921). Basically, it’s a division among the Eskimo-Aleut languages, which straddle the Bering Straits even today, the Athabaskan languages (which were discovered to be related to a small Siberian language family only within the last few years, not by Greenberg as Wade suggested), and everything else.
  
This is not to say that the results from genetics are unimportant, but it’s good to see how it fits with other aspects of our understanding.</p><p>2 0.97095829 <a title="904-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-05-Fattening_of_the_world_and_good_use_of_the_alpha_channel.html">558 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-05-Fattening of the world and good use of the alpha channel</a></p>

Good news: the rate of fattening of the USA appears to be slowing down. Maybe because of high gas prices?

<p>Introduction: Cord Blomquist, who did a great job moving us from horrible Movable Type to nice nice WordPress, writes:
  
I [Cord] wanted to share a little news with you related to the original work we did for you last year.  When ReadyMadeWeb converted your Movable Type blog to WordPress, we got a lot of other requestes for the same service, so we started thinking about a bigger market for such a product.  After a bit of research, we started work on automating the data conversion, writing rules, and exceptions to the rules, on how Movable Type and TypePad data could be translated to WordPress.


After many months of work, we’re getting ready to announce  TP2WP.com , a service that converts Movable Type and TypePad export files to WordPress import files, so anyone who wants to migrate to WordPress can do so easily and without losing permalinks, comments, images, or other files.  By automating our service, we’ve been able to drop the price to just $99.

<p>Introduction: Joan Ginther has won the Texas lottery four times.  First, she won $5.4 million, then a decade later, she won $2million, then two years later $3million and in the summer of 2010, she hit a $10million jackpot. The odds of this has been calculated at one in eighteen septillion and luck like this could only come once every quadrillion years. 
 
 According to Forbes, the residents of Bishop, Texas, seem to believe God was behind it all.  The Texas Lottery Commission told Mr Rich that Ms Ginther must have been ‘born under a lucky star’, and that they don’t suspect foul play.  
 
 Harper’s reporter Nathanial Rich recently wrote an article about Ms Ginther, which calls the the validity of her ‘luck’ into question. First, he points out, Ms Ginther is a former math professor with a PhD from Stanford University specialising in statistics.

<p>Introduction: I was updating my Mac and noticed the following:
 
 
 
Lots of obscure European languages there.  That got me wondering:  what’s the least obscure language  not  on the above list?  Igbo?  Swahili?  Or maybe Tagalog?
 
I did a quick google and found  this  list of languages by number of native speakers.  Once you see the list, the answer is obvious:  Hindi, first language of 295 million people, is not on Apple’s list.  The next most popular languages not included:  Bengali, Punjabi, Javanese, Wu, Telegu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu.  Wow:  most of these are Indian!  Then comes Persian and a bunch of others.
 
It turns out that Tagalog, Igbo, and Swahili, are way down on this list with 28 million, 24 million, and 26 million native speakers, respectively.
 
Only 26 million for Swahili?  This made me want to check the  list of languages by total number of speakers .  The ranking of most of the languages isn’t much different, but Swahili is now #10, at 140 million.  Hindi and Bengali are still th</p><p>same-blog 6 0.9227255 <a title="904-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-13-My_wikipedia_edit.html">904 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-13-My wikipedia edit</a></p>

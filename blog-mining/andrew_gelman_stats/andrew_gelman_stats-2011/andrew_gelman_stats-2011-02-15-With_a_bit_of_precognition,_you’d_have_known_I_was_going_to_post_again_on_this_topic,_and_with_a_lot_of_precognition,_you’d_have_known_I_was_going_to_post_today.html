<p>Introduction: John Talbott points me to  this , which I briefly  mocked  a couple months ago.  I largely agree with the critics of this research, but I want to reiterate my point from earlier that all the statistical sophistication in the world won’t help you if you’re studying a null effect. This is not to say that the actual effect is zero—who am I to say?—just that the comments about the high-quality statistics in the article don’t say much to me.
 
There’s lots of discussion of the lack of science underlying ESP claims.  I can’t offer anything useful on that account (not being a psychologist, I could imagine all sorts of stories about brain waves or whatever), but I would like to point out something that usually doesn’t seem to get mentioned in these discussions, which is that lots of people  want  to believe in ESP.  After all, it would be cool to read minds.

<p>Introduction: Benedict Carey  writes  a follow-up article on ESP studies and Bayesian statistics.  ( See here  for my previous thoughts on the topic.)  Everything Carey writes is fine, and he even uses an example I recommended:
  
The statistical approach that has dominated the social sciences for almost a century is called significance testing. The idea is straightforward. A finding from any well-designed study — say, a correlation between a personality trait and the risk of depression — is considered “significant” if its probability of occurring by chance is less than 5 percent.


This arbitrary cutoff makes sense when the effect being studied is a large one — for example, when measuring the so-called Stroop effect. This effect predicts that naming the color of a word is faster and more accurate when the word and color match (“red” in red letters) than when they do not (“red” in blue letters), and is very strong in almost everyone.

<p>Introduction: The other day I was talking with someone who knows Daryl Bem a bit, and he was sharing his thoughts on that  notorious  ESP paper that was published in a leading journal in the field but then was mocked, shot down, and was repeatedly replicated with no success.  My friend said that overall the Bem paper had positive effects in forcing psychologists to think more carefully about what sorts of research results should or should not be published in top journals, the role of replications, and other things.
 
I expressed agreement and shared my thought that, at some level, I don’t think Bem himself fully believes his ESP effects are real.  Why do I say this?  Because he seemed oddly content to publish results that were not quite conclusive.  He ran a bunch of experiments, looked at the data, and computed some post-hoc p-values in the .01 to .05 range.  If he really were confident that the phenomenon was real (that is, that the results would apply to new data), then he could’ve easily run the</p><p>5 0.22317475 <a title="576-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-How_should_journals_handle_replication_studies%3F.html">762 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-How should journals handle replication studies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sanjay Srivastava  reports :
  
Recently  Ben Goldacre wrote  about a group of researchers (Stuart Ritchie, Chris French, and Richard Wiseman) whose null replication of 3 experiments from the infamous Bem ESP paper was rejected by JPSP – the same journal that published Bem’s paper.
  
Srivastava recognizes that JPSP does not usually publish replications but this is a different story because it’s an anti-replication.
 
Here’s the paradox:
 
- From a scientific point of view, the Ritchie et al. results are boring.  To find out that there’s no evidence for ESP . . . that adds essentially zero to our scientific understanding.  What next, a paper demonstrating that pigeons can fly higher than chickens?  Maybe an article in the Journal of the Materials Research Society demonstrating that diamonds can scratch marble but not the reverse??
 
- But from a science-communication perspective, the null replication is a big deal because it adds credence to  my hypothesis  that the earlier ESP claims</p><p>6 0.20397706 <a title="576-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-26-Suggested_resolution_of_the_Bem_paradox.html">1139 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-26-Suggested resolution of the Bem paradox</a></p>

<p>Introduction: E. J. Wagenmakers writes:
  
You may be interested in  a recent article  [by Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann, and Wagenmakers] showing how often researchers draw conclusions by comparing p-values. As you and Hal Stern have pointed out, this is potentially misleading because the difference between significant and not significant is not necessarily significant.


We were really suprised to see how often researchers in the neurosciences make this mistake. In the paper we speculate a little bit on the cause of the error.
  
From their paper:
  
In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other 
is not (P > 0.05).

<p>Introduction: John Talbott points me to  this , which I briefly  mocked  a couple months ago.  I largely agree with the critics of this research, but I want to reiterate my point from earlier that all the statistical sophistication in the world won’t help you if you’re studying a null effect. This is not to say that the actual effect is zero—who am I to say?—just that the comments about the high-quality statistics in the article don’t say much to me.
 
There’s lots of discussion of the lack of science underlying ESP claims.  I can’t offer anything useful on that account (not being a psychologist, I could imagine all sorts of stories about brain waves or whatever), but I would like to point out something that usually doesn’t seem to get mentioned in these discussions, which is that lots of people  want  to believe in ESP.  After all, it would be cool to read minds.  (It wouldn’t be so cool, maybe, if other people could read your mind and you couldn’t read theirs, but I suspect most people don’t think</p><p>5 0.81196296 <a title="576-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-26-Difficulties_in_making_inferences_about_scientific_truth_from_distributions_of_published_p-values.html">2040 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-26-Difficulties in making inferences about scientific truth from distributions of published p-values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  just posted  the discussions of his paper (with Leah Jager), “An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature,” along with some further comments of his own.
 
 Here  are my original thoughts on an earlier version of their article.  Keith O’Rourke and I expanded these thoughts into  a formal comment  for the journal.  We’re pretty much in agreement with John Ioannidis (you can find his discussion in the top link above).
 
In quick summary, I agree with Jager and Leek that this is an important topic.  I think there are two key places where Keith and I disagree with them:
 
1.  They take published p-values at face value whereas we consider them as the result of a complicated process of selection.  This is something I didn’t used to think much about, but now I’ve become increasingly convinced that the problems with published p-values is not a simple file-drawer effect or the case of a few p=0.051 values nudged toward p=0.049, bu</p><p>6 0.80379462 <a title="576-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-16-%E2%80%9CFalse-positive_psychology%E2%80%9D.html">1171 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-16-“False-positive psychology”</a></p>

When I was in NYC I went to this party by group of Japanese bio-scientists. There, one guy told me about how the biggest pharmaceutical company in Japan did their statistics. They ran 100 different tests and reported the most significant one. (This was in 2006 and he said they stopped doing this few years back so they were doing this until pretty recently…) I’m not sure if this was 100 multiple comparison or 100 different kinds of test but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to disclose their data…

<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email with the subject line “A terrible infographic,” and it went on from there:  “Given some of your recent writing on infovis, I thought you might get a kick out of this . . . I’m certainly sympathetic to their motivations, but some of these plots do not aid understanding…  To pick on a few in particular, the first plot attached, cropped from the infographic, is a strange alternative to a bar plot.  For the second attachment, I still don’t understand what they’ve plotted. . . .”

Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero. The allowance for “uphill” moves saves the method from becoming stuck at local minima—which are the bane of greedier methods.
  
And here’s Wegman:
  
During each step of the algorithm, the variable that will eventually represent the minimum is replaced by a random solution that is chosen according to a temperature</p><p>4 0.95910263 <a title="576-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-19-Statistical_discrimination_again.html">1541 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-19-Statistical discrimination again</a></p>

I’ve recently been investigating a new European Court of Justice ruling on insurance calculations (on behalf of MoneySuperMarket) and I found something related to statistics that caught my attention. . . . The ruling (which comes into effect in December 2012) states that insurers in Europe can no longer provide different premiums based on gender.  Despite the fact that women are statistically safer drivers, unless it’s biologically proven there is a causal relationship between being female and being a safer driver, this is now seen as an act of discrimination (more on this from the Wall Street Journal).


However, where do you stop with this?  What about age?  What about other factors?  And what does this mean for the application of statistics in general?  Is it inherently unjust in this context?


One proposal has been to fit ‘black boxes’ into cars so more individual data can be collected, as opposed to relying heavily on aggregates.

<p>Introduction: I’m on an island in Maine for a few weeks (big shout out for North Haven!)  This morning I picked up a copy of “Working Waterfront,” a newspaper that focuses on issues of coastal fishing communities.  I came across  an article  about modeling “fish” populations — actually lobsters, I guess they’re considered “fish” for regulatory purposes.  When I read it, I thought “wow, this article is really well-written, not dumbed down like articles in most newspapers.” I think it’s great that a small coastal newspaper carries reporting like this. (The online version has a few things that I don’t recall in the print version, too, so it’s even better).  But in addition to being struck by finding such a good article in a small newspaper, I was struck by this:
  
According to [University of Maine scientist Yong] Chen, there are four main areas where his model improved on the prior version. “We included the inshore trawl data from Maine and other state surveys, in addition to federal survey data; we h</p><p>same-blog 6 0.94866359 <a title="576-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-With_a_bit_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_again_on_this_topic%2C_and_with_a_lot_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_today.html">576 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-With a bit of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post again on this topic, and with a lot of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post today</a></p>

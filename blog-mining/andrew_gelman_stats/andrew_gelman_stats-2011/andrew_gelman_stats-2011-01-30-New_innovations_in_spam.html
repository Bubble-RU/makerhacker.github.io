Hello Andrew,


I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.

<p>Introduction: I received the following two emails within fifteen minutes of each other.
 
First, from “Alexa Russell,” subject line “An idea for a blog post: The Role, Importance, and Power of Words”:
  
Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best, 
Alexa

<p>Introduction: A commenter wrote (by email):
  
I’ve noticed that you’ve quit approving my comments on your blog.  I hope I didn’t anger you in some way or write something you felt was inappropriate.
  
My reply:
 
I have not been unapproving any comments.  If you have comments that have not appeared, they have probably been going into the spam filter.  I get literally thousands of spam comments a day and so anything that hits the spam filter is gone forever.  I think there is a way to register as a commenter; that could help.</p><p>5 0.14568292 <a title="545-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-11-Update_on_the_spam_email_study.html">27 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-11-Update on the spam email study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  reported  on the spam email that I received from two business school professors (one at Columbia)!  As noted on the blog, I sent an email directly to the study’s authors at the time of reading the email, but they have yet to respond.
 
This surprises me a bit.  Certainly if 6300 faculty each have time to respond to one email on this study, the two faculty have time to respond to 6300 email replies, no?  I was actually polite enough to respond to  both  of their emails!  If I do hear back, I’ll let youall know!
 
P.S.  Paul Basken interviewed me briefly for  a story  in the Chronicle of Higher Education on the now-notorious spam email study.  Basken’s article is reasonable–he points out that (a) the study irritated a lot of people, but (b) is ultimately no big deal.  
 
One interesting thing about the article is that, although some people felt that the spam email study was ethical, nobody came forth with an argument that the study was actually worth doing.

<p>Introduction: I have to go through the inbox to approve new comments.  When I set to auto-approve, I get overwhelmed with spam.  As is, I still get spam but it’s manageable.
 
Usually the spam is uninteresting but this one caught my eye:
 
   
 
At first this seemed reasonable enough:  law firm is desperate for business, spams blogs to raise its Google ranking.  But what’s with the writing in the actual comment?  It’s incoherent but it doesn’t look computer-generated.  My guess is that the law firm in Massachusetts hired a company that promised to raise their Google rankings, and that this company hired some non-English-speaking foreigners to search through the web and write some spam comments.  If anyone actually reads the comments, they might get the impression that this law firm is staffed by illiterates . . . but, as we all know, nobody reads blog comments!

<p>Introduction: To the person who posted an apparently non-spam comment with a URL link to a “cheap cigarettes” website:  In case you’re wondering, no, your comment didn’t get caught by the spam filter–I’m not sure why not, given that URL.  I put it in the spam file manually.  If you’d like to participate in blog discussion in the future, please refrain from including spam links.  Thank you.

<p>Introduction: I have agreed to do a local art exhibition in February. 
 
An excuse to think about form, colour and style for plotting almost individual observation likelihoods – while invoking the artists privilege of refusing to give interpretations of their own work.
 
In order to make it possibly less dry I’ll try to use intuitive suggestive captions like in this example  TheTyranyof13.pdf 
 
thereby side stepping the technical discussions like here  RadfordNealBlog 
 
Suggested models and data sets (or even submissions) would be most appreciated.
 
I likely be sticking to realism i.e. plots that represent ‘statistical reality’ faithfully.

<p>Introduction: I  agree  with  Casey Mulligan  that participants in government surveys should be paid, and I think it should be part of the code of ethics for commercial pollsters to compensate their respondents also.
 
As Mulligan points out, if a survey is worth doing, it should be worth compensating the participants for their time and effort.
 
P.S.  Just to clarify, I do  not  recommend that Census surveys be made voluntary, I just think that respondents (who can be required to participate) should be paid a small amount.

<p>Introduction: Jouni Kerman did a cool bit of research justifying the Beta (1/3, 1/3) prior as noninformative for binomial data, and the Gamma (1/3, 0) prior for Poisson data.
 
You probably thought that nothing new could be said about noninformative priors in such basic problems, but you were wrong!
 
Here’s  the story :
  
The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events. As alternative default conjugate priors, I [Jouni] introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and Gamma(1/3, 0), which I cal</p><p>same-blog 4 0.98315501 <a title="545-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-30-New_innovations_in_spam.html">545 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-30-New innovations in spam</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email today:
  
Hello Andrew,


I’m interested in whether you are accepting guest article submissions for your site Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science? I’m the owner of the recently created nonprofit site OnlineEngineeringDegree.org and am interested in writing / submitting an article for your consideration to be published on your site. Is that something you’d be willing to consider, and if so, what specs in terms of topics or length requirements would you be looking for?


Thanks you for your time, and if you have any questions or are interested, I’d appreciate you letting me know.


Sincerely, 
Samantha Rhodes

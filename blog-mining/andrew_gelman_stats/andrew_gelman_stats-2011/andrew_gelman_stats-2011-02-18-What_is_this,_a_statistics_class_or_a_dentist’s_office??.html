<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:
  
Phillip is a PhD student in the sociology department . . . He’s in the process of developing his thesis topic around some of the themes we’ve been discussing in this class, such as the emerging data science community.

<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, a few months ago Val Johnson  published  an article, “Revised standards for statistical evidence,” making a Bayesian argument that researchers and journals should use a p=0.005 publication threshold rather than the usual p=0.05.
 
Christian Robert and I were unconvinced by Val’s reasoning and wrote a  response , “Revised evidence for statistical standards,” in which we wrote:
  
Johnson’s minimax prior is not intended to correspond to any distribution of effect sizes; rather, it represents a worst case scenario under some mathematical assumptions. Minimax and tradeoffs do well together, and it is hard for us to see how any worst case procedure can supply much guidance on how to balance between two different losses. . . .


We would argue that the appropriate significance level depends on the scenario and that what worked well for agricultural experiments in the 1920s might not be so appropriate for many applications in modern biosciences . . .</p><p>6 0.13237794 <a title="579-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-07-The_%24900_kindergarten_teacher.html">261 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-07-The $900 kindergarten teacher</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Anthony Goldbloom writes:
  
For those who haven’t come across Kaggle, we are a new platform for data prediction competitions. Companies and researchers put up a dataset and a problem and data scientists compete to produce the best solutions. 


We’ve just launched a new initiative called Kaggle in Class, allowing instructors to host competitions for their students. Competitions are a neat way to engage students, giving them the opportunity to put into practice what they learn. The platform offers live leaderboards, so students get instant feedback on the accuracy of their work. And since competitions are judged on objective criteria (predictions are compared with outcomes), the platform offers unique assessment 
opportunities.


The first Kaggle in Class competition is being hosted by Stanford University’s Stats 202 class and requires students to predict the price of different wines based on vintage, country, ratings and other information.

<p>Introduction: In response to some big new push for testing schoolchildren, Mark Palko  writes :
  
The announcement of a new curriculum is invariably followed by a round of hearty round of self congratulations and talk of “keeping standards high” as if adding a slide to a PowerPoint automatically made students better informed. It doesn’t work that way. Adding a topic to the list simply means that students will be exposed to it, not that they will understand or master or retain it.
  
Well put.  In my own teaching, I often am tempted to believe that just putting a topic in a homework problem is enough to ensure that students will learn it.  But it doesn’t work that way.  Even if they manage to somehow struggle through and solve the problem (and many don’t, or they rely on their friends’ solutions), they won’t learn much if they don’t see the connection with everything else they know.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  points  to a  news article  by Michael Winerip on teacher assessment:
  
No one at the Lab Middle School for Collaborative Studies works harder than Stacey Isaacson, a seventh-grade English and social studies teacher. She is out the door of her Queens home by 6:15 a.m., takes the E train into Manhattan and is standing out front when the school doors are unlocked, at 7. Nights, she leaves her classroom at 5:30. . . .


Her principal, Megan Adams, has given her terrific reviews during the two and a half years Ms. Isaacson has been a teacher. . . . The Lab School has selective admissions, and Ms. Isaacson’s students have excelled. Her first year teaching, 65 of 66 scored proficient on the state language arts test, meaning they got 3′s or 4′s; only one scored below grade level with a 2. More than two dozen students from her first two years teaching have gone on to . . . the city’s most competitive high schools. . . .

<p>Introduction: Val has reported success with the following trick:
  
Get to the classroom a few minutes earlier and turn on soft music.  Then set everything up and, the moment it’s time for class to begin, put a clicker question on the screen and turn off the music.  The students quiet down and get to work right away.
  
I’ve never liked the usual struggle with students to get them to settle down in class, as it seemed to set up a dynamic in which I was trying to get the students to focus and they were trying to goof off.  Turning off the music seems like a great non-confrontational way to send the signal that class is starting.</p><p>2 0.96709538 <a title="579-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-19-What_do_Tuesday%E2%80%99s_elections_tell_us_about_November%3F.html">43 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-19-What do Tuesday’s elections tell us about November?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll defer to  Nate  on the details but just wanted to add a couple of general thoughts.
 
My quick answer is that you can’t learn much from primary elections. They can be important in their effects–both directly on the composition of Congress and indirectly in how they can affect behavior of congressmembers who might be scared of being challenged in future primaries–but I don’t see them as very informative indicators of the general election vote.  Primaries are inherently unpredictable and are generally decided by completely different factors, and from completely different electorates, than those that decide general elections.
 
The PA special election is a bit different since it’s a Dem vs. a Rep, but it’s also an n of 1, and it’s an election now rather than in November. Nate makes a convincing case that it’s evidence in favor of the Democrats, even if not by much.</p><p>3 0.95868123 <a title="579-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-17-Somebody%E2%80%99s_looking_for_a_book_on_time_series_analysis_in_the_style_of_Angrist_and_Pischke%2C_or_Gelman_and_Hill.html">1986 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-17-Somebody’s looking for a book on time series analysis in the style of Angrist and Pischke, or Gelman and Hill</a></p>

I am a student of economics and recently read  your review  of Mostly Harmless Econometrics. In the review you mention that the book contains no time series. Given that your book on data analysis (Data Analysis using Regression) does not contain any time series material either, I wonder if you happen to have any favourite time series reference similar in style/level to the data analysis book.
  
I don’t know.  The closest thing might be Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand, but I don’t know of anything focused on time series that’s quite in the format that I’d prefer. This is not my area, though.  Maybe you, the readers, have some suggestions?</p><p>4 0.9568373 <a title="579-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-22-Politics_is_not_a_random_walk%3A__Momentum_and_mean_reversion_in_polling.html">364 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-22-Politics is not a random walk:  Momentum and mean reversion in polling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nate Silver and Justin Wolfers are having a friendly blog-dispute about momentum in political polling.  Nate and Justin each make good points but are also missing parts of the picture.  These questions relate to my own research so I thought I’d discuss them here.
  

 
 There ain’t no mo’ 
 
Nate  led off  the discussion by writing that pundits are always talking about “momentum” in the polls:
  
Turn on the news or read through much of the analysis put out by some of our friends, and you’re likely to hear a lot of talk about “momentum”: the term is used about 60 times per day by major media outlets in conjunction with articles about polling.


When people say a particular candidate has momentum, what they are implying is that present trends are likely to perpetuate themselves into the future. Say, for instance, that a candidate trailed by 10 points in a poll three weeks ago — and now a new poll comes out showing the candidate down by just 5 points. It will frequently be said that this</p><p>5 0.95251143 <a title="579-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-27-Continued_fractions%21%21.html">1827 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-27-Continued fractions!!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Upon reading  this note  by John Cook on continued fractions, I wrote:
  
If you like continued fractions, I recommend you read the relevant parts of the classic Numerical Methods That Work. The details are probably obsolete but it’s fun reading (at least, if you think that sort of thing is fun to read).
  
I then looked up Acton in Wikipedia and was surprised to see he’s still alive. And he wrote a second book (published at the age of 77!). I wonder if it’s any good. It’s sobering to read Numerical Methods That Work: it’s so wonderful and so readable, yet in this modern era there’s really not much reason to read it. Perhaps William Goldman (hey, I checked: he’s still alive too!) or some equivalent could prepare a 50-page “good parts” version that could be still be useful as a basic textbook.</p><p>6 0.95079678 <a title="579-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-12-How_to_best_graph_the_Beveridge_curve%2C_relating_the_vacancy_rate_in_jobs_to_the_unemployment_rate%3F.html">1894 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-12-How to best graph the Beveridge curve, relating the vacancy rate in jobs to the unemployment rate?</a></p>

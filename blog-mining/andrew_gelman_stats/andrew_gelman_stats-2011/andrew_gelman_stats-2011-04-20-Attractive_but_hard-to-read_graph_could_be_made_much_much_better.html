I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:
 
 
Average Hours Per Day Spent in Each Activity

           Work,   Unpaid  Eating, Personal
Country    study    work  sleeping   care   Leisure  Other

France       4        3       11       1       2       2
Germany      4        3       10       1       3       3

</p><p>6 Anyway, my first thought was that the above ugly graph should be redone as a line plot,  Here’s what I came up with after an hour of work (yeah, yeah, I must have a lot of real work to do if I’m willing to put in this level of procrastination. [sent-16, score-0.643]

</p><p>9 I like it because you can directly compare within a country–to see which activities are done more and which are done less, compared to the average. [sent-25, score-0.25]

</p><p>11 This between-country comparison would be clearer if we put all the lines on the same graph, but that looks a bit busy to me and I’m happier with the separate line plots. [sent-27, score-0.092]
</p><p>12 In any country, the categories add to 24 hours, and the circle plot enforces that constraint. [sent-30, score-0.375]
</p><p>13 (They could’ve made pie charts but everyone knows how bad that is. [sent-31, score-0.099]
</p><p>14 )  But there are a lot of categories so they needed colors and a legend. [sent-32, score-0.27]
</p><p>15 And the circle arcs are hard to compare so they needed to put in the exact numbers. [sent-33, score-0.252]
</p><p>16 And I’m sure that if a graphics designer worked with me on it, the graph could be better still. [sent-36, score-0.254]
</p><p>17 At some point this would represent a bit too much effort spent on one particular graph in a weekly newspaper. [sent-37, score-0.446]
</p><p>18 But if we have enough good examples of these, they could represent a template that could be used all over. [sent-38, score-0.2]

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.  It represents neither a dat</p><p>3 0.17979251 <a title="670-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>4 0.16732751 <a title="670-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-One_more_time-use_graph.html">671 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-One more time-use graph</a></p>

Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.  On the other hand, if Evgn and I were working together on such a graph, we w</p><p>5 0.16377558 <a title="670-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-16-Greenland_is_one_tough_town.html">1677 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-16-Greenland is one tough town</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>6 0.1607068 <a title="670-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-The_R_code_for_those_time-use_graphs.html">672 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-The R code for those time-use graphs</a></p>

Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.  On the other hand, if Evgn and I were working together on such a graph, we w</p><p>3 0.87020636 <a title="670-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-The_R_code_for_those_time-use_graphs.html">672 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-The R code for those time-use graphs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

<p>Introduction: I saw this graph  posted  by Tyler Cowen:
 
   
 
and my first thought was that the bar plot should be replaced by a line plot:  Six lines, one for each income category, with each line being a time series of these changes.  With a line plot, you can more easily see each time series (these are hard to see in the barplot because you have to follow each color and jump from decade to decade) and also compare the patterns for each category.  The line plot pretty much dominates the bar plot.
 
At least that was the theory.  Now here’s what actually happened.
 
I downloaded the data as Excel files, saved them as csv, then read them into R.  In all, it took close to an hour to get the data set up in the format that was needed to make the graphs.  At this point it was pretty easy to make the line plot.  But the result was disappointing:
 
   
 
The six lines are hard to untangle (sure, a better color scheme might help, but it wouldn’t really solve the problem) and the graph as a whole is much l</p><p>6 0.85746348 <a title="670-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-29-Infovis_vs._statgraphics%3A__A_clear_example_of_their_different_goals.html">829 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-29-Infovis vs. statgraphics:  A clear example of their different goals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few years ago Larry Bartels  presented  this graph, a version of which latter appeared in his book Unequal Democracy:
 
 
 
Larry looked at the data in a number of ways, and the evidence seemed convincing that, at least in the short term, the Democrats were better than Republicans for the economy. This is consistent with Democrats’ general policies of lowering unemployment, as compared to Republicans lowering inflation, and, by comparing first-term to second-term presidents, he found that the result couldn’t simply be explained as a rebound or alternation pattern.
 
The question then arose, why have the Republicans won so many elections? Why aren’t the Democrats consistently dominating? Non-economic issues are part of the story, of course, but lots of evidence shows the economy to be a key concern for voters, so it’s still hard to see how, with a pattern such as shown above, the Republicans could keep winning.
 
Larry had some explanations, largely having to do with timing:  under De</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96195543 <a title="670-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-Attractive_but_hard-to-read_graph_could_be_made_much_much_better.html">670 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-Attractive but hard-to-read graph could be made much much better</a></p>

I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:

<p>Introduction: James Robins, Tyler VanderWeele, and Richard Gill  write :
  
Neyman introduced a formal mathematical theory of counterfactual causation that now has become standard language in many quantitative disciplines, but not in physics. We use results on causal interaction and interference between treatments (derived under the Neyman theory) to give a simple new proof of a well-known result in quantum physics, namely, Bellís inequality.


Now the predictions of quantum mechanics and the results of experiment both violate Bell’s inequality. In the remainder of the talk, we review the implications for a counterfactual theory of causation. Assuming with Einstein that faster than light (supraluminal) communication is not possible, one can view the Neyman theory of counterfactuals as falsified by experiment. . . .


Is it safe for a quantitative discipline to rely on a counterfactual approach to causation, when our best confirmed physical theory falsifies their existence?

<p>Introduction: A recent  discussion  between commenters Question and Fernando captured one of the recurrent themes here from the past year.
 
 Question:   The problem is simple, the researchers are disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.
 
 Fernando:   Whereas it is probably true that researchers misuse NHT, the problem with tabloid science is broader and deeper. It is systemic.
 
 Question:   I do not see how anything can be deeper than replacing careful description, prediction, falsification, and independent replication with dynamite plots, p-values, affirming the consequent, and peer review. From my own experience I am confident in saying that confusion caused by NHST is at the root of this problem.
 
 Fernando:   Incentives? Impact factors? Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . .

<p>Introduction: Dave Backus points me to  this review  by anthropologist Mike McGovern of two books by economist Paul Collier on the politics of economic development in Africa.  My first reaction was that this was interesting but non-statistical so I’d have to either post it on the sister blog or wait until the 30 days of statistics was over.  But then I looked more carefully and realized that this discussion is very relevant to applied statistics. 
 
Here’s McGovern’s substantive critique:
  
Much of the fundamental intellectual work in Collier’s analyses is, in fact, ethnographic. Because it is not done very self-consciously and takes place within a larger econometric rhetoric in which such forms of knowledge are dismissed as “subjective” or worse still biased by the political (read “leftist”) agendas of the academics who create them, it is often ethnography of a low quality. . . .

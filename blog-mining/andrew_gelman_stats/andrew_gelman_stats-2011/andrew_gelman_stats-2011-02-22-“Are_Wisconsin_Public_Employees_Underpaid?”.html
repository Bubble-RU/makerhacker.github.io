 Ezra Klein  and a variety of other thoughtful liberal bloggers have been pointing to an Economic Policy Institute analysis that they claim demonstrates that Wisconsin’s public employees, even after adjusting for benefits and hours worked, face a ” compensation penalty of 5% for choosing to work in the public sector.” Unfortunately, when you get under the hood, the study shows no such thing. . . . reading the  actual paper  by Jeffrey H. Keefe is instructive. Keefe took a representative sample of Wisconsin workers, and built a regression model that relates “fundamental personal characteristics and labor market skills” to compensation, and then compared public to private sector employees, after “controlling” for these factors.

<p>Introduction: Under the headline, “A Raise Won’t Make You Work Harder,” Ray Fisman  writes :
  
To understand why it might be a bad idea to cut wages in recessions, it’s useful to know how workers respond to changes in pay–both positive and negative changes. Discussion on the topic goes back at least as far as Henry Ford’s “5 dollars a day,” which he paid to assembly line workers in 1914. The policy was revolutionary at the time, as the wages were more than double what his competitors were paying. This wasn’t charity. Higher-paid workers were efficient workers–Ford attracted the best mechanics to his plant, and the high pay ensured that employees worked hard throughout their eight-hour shifts, knowing that if their pace slackened, they’d be out of a job. Raising salaries to boost productivity became known as “efficiency wages.”
  
So far, so good.  Fisman then moves from history and theory to recent research:

<p>Introduction: After our discussions of psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s opinions about working-class voters (see  here  and  here ), a question arose on how to reconcile the  analyses  of Alan Abramowitz and Tom Edsall (showing an increase in Republican voting among low-education working white southerners), with Larry Bartels’s  finding  that “there has been no discernible trend in presidential voting behavior among the ‘working white working class.’”
 
Here is my resolution:
 
All the statistics that have been posted seem reasonable to me.  Also relevant to the discussion, I believe, are Figures 3.1, 4.2b, 10.1, and 10.2 of Red State Blue State.  In short:  Republicans continue to do about 20 percentage points better among upper-income voters compared to lower-income, but the compositions of these coalitions have changed over time.  As has been noted, low-education white workers have moved toward the Republican party over the past few decades, and at the same time there have been compositional changes</p><p>4 0.12524013 <a title="584-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-SeeThroughNY.html">140 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-SeeThroughNY</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?

<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Reed Abelson and Gardiner Harris  report  in the New York Times that some serious statistical questions have been raised about the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, an influential project that reports huge differences in health care costs and practices in different places in the United States, suggesting large potential cost savings if more efficient practices are used.  (A claim that is certainly plausible to me, given  this notorious graph ; see  here  for background.)
 
Here’s an example of a claim from the  Dartmouth Atlas  (just picking something that happens to be featured on their webpage right now):
  
Medicare beneficiaries who move to some regions receive many more diagnostic tests and new diagnoses than those who move to other regions. This study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, raises important questions about whether being given more diagnoses is beneficial to patients and may help to explain recent controversies about regional differences in spending.

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: Ooooooh, I never ever thought I’d have a legitimate excuse to tell this story, and now I do!  The story took place many years ago, but first I have to tell you what made me think of it:
 
Rasmus Bååth  posted  the following comment last month:
  
On airplane tickets a Swedish “å” is written as “aa” resulting in Rasmus Baaaath. Once I bought a ticket online and five minutes later a guy from Lufthansa calls me and asks if I misspelled my name…
  
OK, now here’s my story (which is not nearly as good).  A long time ago (but when I was already an adult), I was in England for some reason, and I thought I’d take a day trip from London to Bath.  So here I am on line, trying to think of what to say at the ticket counter.  I remember that in England, they call Bath, Bahth.  So, should I ask for “a ticket to Bahth”?  I’m not sure, I’m afraid that it will sound silly, like I’m trying to fake an English accent.  So, when I get to the front of the line, I say, hesitantly, “I’d like a ticket to Bath?</p><p>3 0.96700323 <a title="584-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-11-Convergence_Monitoring_for_Non-Identifiable_and_Non-Parametric_Models.html">1374 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-11-Convergence Monitoring for Non-Identifiable and Non-Parametric Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Becky Passonneau and colleagues at the Center for Computational Learning Systems (CCLS) at Columbia have been working on a project for ConEd (New York’s major electric utility) to  rank structures based on vulnerability to secondary events  (e.g., transformer explosions, cable meltdowns, electrical fires).  They’ve been using the R implementation  BayesTree  of Chipman, George and McCulloch’s  Bayesian Additive Regression Trees  (BART).
 
BART is a Bayesian non-parametric method that is non-identifiable in two ways.  Firstly, it is an additive tree model with a fixed number of trees, the indexes of which aren’t identified (you get the same predictions in a model swapping the order of the trees).  This is the same kind of non-identifiability you get with any mixture model (additive or interpolated) with an exchangeable prior on the mixture components.  Secondly, the trees themselves have varying structure over samples in terms of number of nodes and their topology (depth, branching, etc</p><p>4 0.96557719 <a title="584-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-27-%E2%80%9CApple_confronts_the_law_of_large_numbers%E2%80%9D_._._._huh%3F.html">1187 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-27-“Apple confronts the law of large numbers” . . . huh?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was reading this  news article  by famed business reporter James Stewart: 
  
  
Measured by market capitalization, Apple is the world’s biggest public company. . . . Sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 . . . totaled $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from the year before. Earnings more than doubled. . . . Here is the rub: Apple is so big, it’s running up against the law of large numbers.
  
Huh?  At this point I sat up, curious.  Stewart continued:
  
Also known as the golden theorem, with a proof attributed to the 17th-century Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the law states that a variable will revert to a mean over a large sample of results. In the case of the largest companies, it suggests that high earnings growth and a rapid rise in share price will slow as those companies grow ever larger.


If Apple’s share price grew even 20 percent a year for the next decade, which is far below its current blistering pace, its $500 billion market capitalization would be more than $3 tri</p><p>5 0.96410078 <a title="584-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-06-Calling_Jenny_Davidson_._._..html">1790 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-06-Calling Jenny Davidson . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that you have some free time again, you’ll have to check out  these books  and tell us if they’re worth reading.
 
Claire Kirch  reports :
  
Lizzie Skurnick Books launches in September with the release of Debutante Hill by Lois Duncan. The novel, which was originally published by Dodd, Mead, in 1958, has been out of print for about three decades.


The other books on the initial list, all reissues, are A Long Day in November by Ernest J. Gaines (originally published in 1971), Happy Endings Are All Alike by Sandra Scoppettone (1979), I’ll Love You When You’re More Like Me by M.E. Kerr (1977), Secret Lives by Berthe Amoss (1979), To All My Fans, With Love, From Sylvie by Ellen Conford (1982), and Me and Fat Glenda by Lila Perl (1972). . . .


Noting that many of the books of that era beloved by teen boys are still in print – such as Isaac Asimov’s novels and The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier – Skurnick pointed out that, in contrast, many of the books that were embraced by teen gir</p><p>6 0.95977896 <a title="584-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-29-Stupid_legal_crap.html">58 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-29-Stupid legal crap</a></p>

I’ve seen some Bayes related things recently that might make for interesting fodder on your blog.


There are two books, teaching Bayesian analysis from a programming perspective.


And also a “web application for data analysis using powerful Bayesian statistical methods.”
  
   
I took a look.  The first book is  Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics Made Simple, by Allen B. Downey .  It’s super readable and, amazingly, has approximately zero overlap with Bayesian Data Analysis.  Downey discusses lots of little problems in a conversational way.  In some ways it’s like an old-style math stat textbook (although with a programming rather than mathematical flavor) in that the examples are designed for simplicity rather than realism.  I like it!  Our book already exists; it’s good to have something else for people to read, coming from an entirely different perspective.

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  links  to Steve Hsu  linking  to a 1977  interview  by Katherine Sopka of physics professor Sidney Coleman.
 
I don’t know anything about Coleman’s research but the interview caught my eye because one of my roommates in grad school was one of Coleman’s advisees.
 
Anyway, here’s the key bit from the interview:
  
Sopka:  But you do enjoy working with students or do you?


Coleman:  No. I hate it. You do it as part of the job. Well, that’s of course false…or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. Occasionally there’s a student who is a joy to work with. But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students…


Sopka:  I guess your remark means then that you would like to avoid teaching undergraduate courses or even required graduate courses…


Coleman:  Or even special topics courses. Teaching is unpleasant work. No question about it. It has its rewards. One feels happy about having a job well done.

<p>Introduction: My paper with Christian Robert,  “Not Only Defended But Also Applied”: The Perceived Absurdity of Bayesian Inference , was recently published in The American Statistician, along with discussions by Steve Fienberg, Steve Stigler, Deborah Mayo, and Wesley Johnson, and our rejoinder,  The Anti-Bayesian Moment and Its Passing .
 
These articles revolved around the question of why the great probabilist William Feller, in his classic book on probability (“Feller, Volume 1,” as it is known), was so intemperately anti-Bayesian.  We located Feller’s attitude within a post-WW2 “anti-Bayesian moment” in which Bayesian inference was perceived as a threat to the dominance of non-Bayesian methods, which were mature enough to have solved problems yet new enough to still appear to have limitless promise.

We are pleased to announce that Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was renewed for another round of funding by NSF starting last Fall. TESS allows researchers to submit proposals for experiments to be conducted on a nationally-representative, probability-based Internet platform, and successful proposals are fielded at no cost to investigators.  More information about how TESS works and how to submit proposals is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org.


Additionally, we are pleased to announce the development of two new proposal mechanisms. TESS’s Short Studies Program (SSP) is accepting proposals for fielding very brief population-based survey experiments on a general population of at least 2000 adults. SSP recruits participants from within the U.S. using the same Internet-based platform as other TESS studies. More information about SSP and proposal requirements is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org/ssp.</p><p>4 0.97044981 <a title="862-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-18-%E2%80%9CIntrade_to_the_57th_power%E2%80%9D.html">1540 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-18-“Intrade to the 57th power”</a></p>

 http://PredictWiseQ.com  is our (beta) prediction contest which aims to estimate not just the marginal probabilities of election outcomes this November, but millions of correlations among outcomes as well, like the chance Obama will win both Ohio and Florida, or the chance Romney will win if the September jobs numbers are negative. It’s a working example of a combinatorial prediction market design we published this summer in the conference ACM EC’12.

<p>Introduction: Aleks sends along  this  (by Robert Ghrist).  It reminds me a lot of my class notes from high school.
 
I took a look at the book, starting on page 1 with the description of functions, and it made me think that maybe a more historical approach would be useful.  The idea presented in this book, of a function as an arbitrary mapping from inputs to outputs, is a relatively modern idea (I associate it with Fourier in the 1800s, but my remembered history might be wrong here), and it might be helpful to build up to it from simpler ideas.
 
Similarly, instead of starting with definitions of limits etc., I suspect it would be better to start with the theorems and then motivate the definitions as the things you need to prove the theorems rigorously.  That’s the historical order, right?  Theorem, then proof, then defining the conditions of the theorem.
 
I sent the above paragraphs to Aleks, who commented:
  
Agreed strongly. But you’re assuming that theorems are intrinsically interesting, or th</p><p>6 0.96007347 <a title="862-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-05-Call_for_book_proposals.html">557 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-05-Call for book proposals</a></p>

What is the best way to examine interactions of independent variables in a propensity weights framework?  Let’s say we are interested in estimating breathing difficulty (measured on a continuous scale) and our main predictor is age of housing.  The object is to estimate whether living in housing 20 years or older is associated with breathing difficulty compared counterfactually to those living in housing less than 20 years old; as a secondary question, we want to know whether that effect differs for those in poverty compared to those not in poverty.  In our first-stage propensity model, we include whether the respondent lives in poverty.  The weights applied to the other covariates in the propensity model are similar to those living in poverty compared to those who are not.  Now, can I simply interact the poverty variable with the age of construction variable to look at the interaction of age of housing and poverty on breathing difficulty?

Andrew points out that a causal analysis is needed. This reminds me of an intervention that has been done before: take a child out of poverty, and bring him up in a better-off family. What’s going to happen? There have been several studies examining correlations between adoptive and biological parents’ IQ (assuming IQ is a test analogous to the math and verbal tests, and that parent IQ is analogous to the quality of instruction – but the point is in the analysis not in the metric). This is the result (from  Adoption Strategies  by Robin P Corley in Encyclopedia of Life Sciences):

<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Guido Imbens and I  write :
  
The statistical and econometrics literature on causality is more focused on “effects of causes” than on “causes of effects.” That is, in the standard approach it is natural to study the effect of a treatment, but it is not in general possible to define the causes of any particular outcome. This has led some researchers to dismiss the search for causes as “cocktail party chatter” that is outside the realm of science. We argue here that the search for causes can be understood within traditional statistical frameworks as a part of model checking and hypothesis generation. We argue that it can make sense to ask questions about the causes of effects, but the answers to these questions will be in terms of effects of causes.
  
We also  posted  the paper on NBER so I’m hoping it will get some attention from economists.  [Again,  here's  the open link to the paper.]  I think what we have here is an important idea linking statistical and econometric models of caus</p><p>6 0.10096861 <a title="560-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-10-Life_in_New_York%2C_Then_and_Now.html">139 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-10-Life in New York, Then and Now</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jacob Felson writes:
  
Say we have a statistically significant interaction in non-experimental data between two continuous predictors, X and Z and it is unclear which variable is primarily a cause and which variable is primarily a moderator.  One person might find it more plausible to think of X as a cause and Z as a moderator and another person may think the reverse more plausible.  My question then is whether there is are any set of rules or heuristics you could recommend to help adjudicate between alternate perspectives on such an interaction term.
  
My reply:
 
I think in this setting, it would make sense to think about different interventions, some of which affect X, others of which affect Z, others of which affect both, and go from there.  Rather than trying to isolate a single causal path, consider different cases of forward casual inference.

<p>Introduction: As I’ve written here many times, my experiences in social science and public health research have left me skeptical of statistical methods that hypothesize or try to detect zero relationships between observational data (see, for example, the discussion starting at the bottom of page 960 in  my review of causal inference  in the American Journal of Sociology).  In short, I have a taste for continuous rather than discrete models.
 
As discussed in the above-linked article (with respect to the writings of cognitive scientist Steven Sloman), I think that common-sense thinking about causal inference can often mislead.
 
In many cases, I have found that that the theoretical frameworks of instrumental variables and potential outcomes (for a review see, for example, chapters 9 and 10 of my book with Jennifer) help clarify my thinking.
 
Here is an example that came up in a recent blog discussion.

<p>Introduction: Hey, we all know the answer:  “correlation does not imply causation”—but of course life is more complicated than that.  As philosophers, economists, statisticians, and others have repeatedly noted, most of our information about the world is observational not experimental, yet we manage to draw causal conclusions all the time.  Sure, some of these conclusions are wrong (more often than 5% of the time, I’m sure) but that’s an accepted part of life.
 
Challenges in this regard arise in the design of a study, in the statistical analysis, in how you write it up for a peer-reviewed journal, and finally in how you present it to the world.

<p>Introduction: 1.  Freakonomics  characterizes  drunk driving as an example of “the human tendency to worry about rare problems that are unlikely to happen.”
 
2.  The CDC  reports , “Alcohol-impaired drivers are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.”
 
No offense to the tenured faculty at the University of Chicago, but I’m going with the CDC on this one. 
   
P.S.  The Freakonomics blog deserves to be dinged another time, not just for claiming, based on  implausible assumptions  and making the all-else-equal  fallacy  that “drunk walking is 8 times more likely to result in your death than drunk driving” but for presenting this weak inference as a fact rather than as a speculation.
 
When doing “Freakonomics,” you can be counterintuitive, or you can be sensible, but it’s hard to be both. I mean, sure, sometimes you can be. But there’s a tradeoff, and in this case, they’re choosing to push the envelope on counterintuitiveness.</p><p>3 0.9689014 <a title="560-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-31-Question_21_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1356 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-31-Question 21 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 21. A country is divided into three regions with populations of 2 million, 2 million, and 0.5 million, respectively. A survey is done asking about foreign policy opinions.. Somebody proposes taking a sample of 50 people from each reason. Give a reason why this non-proportional sample would not usually be done, and also a reason why it might actually be a good idea.
 
 Solution to question 20 
 
From  yesterday :
  
20. Explain in two sentences why we expect survey respondents to be honest about vote preferences but possibly dishonest about reporting unhealty behaviors.
  
Solution:  Respondents tend to be sincere about vote preferences because this affects the outcome of the poll, and people are motivated to have their candidate poll well.  This motivation is typically not present in reporting behaviors; you have no particular reason for wanting to affect the average survey response.</p><p>4 0.95511413 <a title="560-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-30-Systematic_review_of_publication_bias_in_studies_on_publication_bias.html">1291 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-30-Systematic review of publication bias in studies on publication bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  Yalda Afshar ,  a 2005 paper  by Hans-Hermann Dubben and Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt:
  
Publication bias is a well known phenomenon in clinical literature, in which positive results have a better chance of being published, are published earlier, and are published in journals with higher impact factors. Conclusions exclusively based on published studies, therefore, can be misleading. Selective under-reporting of research might be more widespread and more likely to have adverse consequences for patients than publication of deliberately falsified data. We investigated whether there is preferential publication of positive papers on publication bias.
  
They conclude, “We found no evidence of publication bias in reports on publication bias.”  But of course that’s the sort of finding regarding publication bias of findings on publication bias that you’d expect would get published.  What we really need is a careful meta-analysis to estimate the level of publication bias in studies of publi</p><p>5 0.94651556 <a title="560-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-%E2%80%9CCity_Opens_Inquiry_on_Grading_Practices_at_a_Top-Scoring_Bronx_School%E2%80%9D.html">529 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-“City Opens Inquiry on Grading Practices at a Top-Scoring Bronx School”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sharon Otterman  reports :
  
When report card grades were released in the fall for the city’s 455 high schools, the highest score went to a small school in a down-and-out section of the Bronx . . . A stunning 94 percent of its seniors graduated, more than 30 points above the citywide average. . . . “When I interviewed for the school,” said Sam Buchbinder, a history teacher, “it was made very clear: this is a school that doesn’t believe in anyone failing.”


That statement was not just an exhortation to excellence. It was school policy.


By order of the principal, codified in the school’s teacher handbook, all teachers should grade their classes in the same way: 30 percent of students should earn a grade in the A range, 40 percent B’s, 25 percent C’s, and no more than 5 percent D’s. As long as they show up, they should not fail.

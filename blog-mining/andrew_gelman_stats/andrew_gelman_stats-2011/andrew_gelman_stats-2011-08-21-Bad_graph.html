<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email with the subject line “A terrible infographic,” and it went on from there:  “Given some of your recent writing on infovis, I thought you might get a kick out of this . . . I’m certainly sympathetic to their motivations, but some of these plots do not aid understanding…  To pick on a few in particular, the first plot attached, cropped from the infographic, is a strange alternative to a bar plot.  For the second attachment, I still don’t understand what they’ve plotted. . . .”
 
I agree with everything he wrote, but this point I think I’m getting too exhausted to laugh at graphs unless there is an obvious political bias to point to.</p><p>3 0.15755756 <a title="863-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>

So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>5 0.11881097 <a title="863-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-23-Life_in_the_C-suite%3A__A_graph_that_is_both_ugly_and_bad%2C_and_an_unrelated_story.html">1734 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-23-Life in the C-suite:  A graph that is both ugly and bad, and an unrelated story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jemes Keirstead sends along  this infographic :
 
 
 
He hates it:
  
First we’ve got an hourglass metaphor wrecked by the fact that “now” (i.e. the pinch point in the glass) is actually 3-5 years in the future and the past sand includes “up to three years” in the future.  Then there are the percentages which are appear to represent a vertical distance, not volume of sand or width of the hourglass.  Add to that a strange color scheme in which green goes from dark to light to dark again.


I know January’s not even finished yet, but surely a competitor for worst infographic of 2013?
  
Keirstead doesn’t even comment on what I see as the worst aspect of the graph, which is that the “3-5 years” band is the narrowest on the graph, but expressed as a per-year rate it is actually the  highest  of all the percentages.  The hourglass visualization does the astounding feat of taking the period where the executives expect the highest rate of change and presenting it as a minimum in the graph.</p><p>6 0.11471077 <a title="863-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-14-Desecration_of_valuable_real_estate.html">572 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-14-Desecration of valuable real estate</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.  It represents neither a dat</p><p>3 0.8199712 <a title="863-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-27-Graph_of_the_year.html">488 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-27-Graph of the year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From blogger  Matthew Yglesias :
 
 
 
There are lots of great graphs all over the web (see, for example,  here  and  here  for some snappy pictures of unemployment trends from blogger “Geoff”).
 
There’s nothing special about Yglesias’s graph.  In fact, the reason I’m singling it out as “graph of the year” is  because  it’s not special.
  

 
It’s a display of three numbers, with no subtlety or artistry in its presentation.  True, it has some good features: 
- Clear title 
- Clearly labeled axes 
- Vertical axis goes to zero 
- The cities are in a sensible order (not, for example, alphabetical) 
- The graphs is readable; none of that 3-D “data visualization” crap that looks cool but distances the reader from the numbers being displayed.
 
What’s impressive about the above graph, what makes it a landmark to me, is that it was made at all.  As noted in the text immediately below the image, it’s a display of exactly three numbers which can with little effort be completely presented and e</p><p>4 0.80532724 <a title="863-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-30-Bill_Gates%E2%80%99s_favorite_graph_of_the_year.html">2154 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-30-Bill Gates’s favorite graph of the year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the subject line “Blog bait!”, Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  post at the Washington Post blog:
  
For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.


    
Infographic by Thomas Porostocky for WIRED.


“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>5 0.79442483 <a title="863-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a mini research note, not deserving of a paper, but perhaps useful to others. It reinvents what has already  appeared  on this blog.
 
Let’s say we have a line chart with numbers between 152.134 and 210.823, with the mean of 183.463. How should we label the chart with about 3 tics? Perhaps 152.132, 181.4785 and 210.823? Don’t do it!
 
Objective is to fit about 3-7 tics at the optimal level of rounding. I use the following sequence:
  
  decimal rounding : fitting integer  power  and single-digit decimal  i , rounding to  i  * 10^ power  (example: 100 200 300) 
  binary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and binary  b , rounding to 2* i /(1+ b ) * 10^ power  (150 200 250) 
 (optional)  quaternary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and  quaternary  q  (0,1,2,3) round to 4* i /(1+ q ) * 10^ power  (150 175 200) 
  quinary  having  power , fitting single-digit decimal  i  and  quinary  f  (0,1,2,3,4) round to 5* i /(1+ f ) * 10^ power  (160 180 200)</p><p>2 0.80883533 <a title="863-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-16-2500_people_living_in_a_park_in_Chicago%3F.html">469 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-16-2500 people living in a park in Chicago?</a></p>

Columbus Park is on Chicago’s west side, in the Austin neighborhood. The park is a big green area which includes a golf course.


 Here  is the google satellite view.


 Here  is the nytimes page.  Go to Chicago, and zoom over to the census tract 2521, which is just north of the horizontal gray line (Eisenhower Expressway, aka I290) and just east of Oak Park. The park is labeled on the nytimes map.


The census data have around 50 dots (they say 50 people per dot) in the park which has no residential buildings.


Congressional district is Danny Davis, IL7.   Here’s  a map of the district.


So, how do we explain the map showing ~50 dots worth of people living in the park. What’s up with the algorithm to place the dots?
  
I dunno.  I leave this one to you, the readers.</p><p>3 0.7967695 <a title="863-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-08-How_adoption_speed_affects_the_abandonment_of_cultural_tastes.html">845 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-08-How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Interesting  article  by Jonah Berger and Gael Le Mens:
  
Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-r</p><p>4 0.79286897 <a title="863-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-19-Happy_birthday.html">2139 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-19-Happy birthday</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aki writes:
  
Here’s my version of the  birthday frequency graph . I used Gaussian process with two slowly varying components and periodic component with decay, so that periodic form can change in time. I used Student’s t-distribution as observation model to allow exceptional dates to be outliers. I guess that periodic component due to week effect is still in the data because there is data only from twenty years. Naturally it would be better to model the whole timeseries, but it was easier to just use the cvs by Mulligan.
  
   
 
ALl I can say is . . . wow.  Bayes wins again.  Maybe Aki can supply the R or Matlab code?
 
P.S.  And let’s not forget how great the simple and clear time series plots are, compared to various fancy visualizations that people might try.

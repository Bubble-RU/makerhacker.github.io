<p>Introduction: Frontiers of Science is a course offered as part of Columbia University’s Core Curriculum.  The course is controversial, with some people praising its overview of several areas of science, and others feeling that a more traditional set of introductory science courses would do the job better.
 
Last month, the faculty in charge of the course wrote the following public  letter : 
  
  
The United States is in the midst of a debate over the value of a traditional college education. Why enroll in a place like Columbia College when you can obtain an undergraduate degree for $10,000 or learn everything from Massive Open Online Courses? In more parochial terms, what is the value added by approaches such as Columbia’s Core Curriculum? Recently students in our Core Course, Frontiers of Science (FoS), provided a partial answer. The FoS faculty designed a survey to gauge the scientific skills and knowledge of the Class of 2016 both before and after taking FoS.

<p>Introduction: Now that September has arrived, it’s time for us to think teaching.   Here’s something  from Andrew Heckler and Eleanor Sayre.  Heckler writes:
  
The article describes a project studying the performance of university level students taking an intro physics course. Every week for ten weeks we took 1/10th of the students (randomly selected only once) and gave them the same set of questions relevant to the course. This allowed us to plot the evolution of average performance in the class during the quarter.  We can then determine when learning occurs: For example, do they learn the material in a relevant lecture or lab or homework? Since we had about 350 students taking the course, we could get some reasonable stats.


In particular, you might be interested in Figure 10 (page 774) which shows student performance day-by-day on a particular question.  The performance does not change directly after lecture, but rather only when the homework was due.

<p>Introduction: Alex Tabarrok  writes :
  
There is something special, magical, and “almost sacred” about the live teaching experience. I agree that this is true for teaching at its best but it’s also irrelevant. It’s even more true that there is something special, magical and almost sacred about the live musical experience. . . .


Mark Edmundson makes the analogy between teaching and music explicit:

 
Every memorable class is a bit like a jazz composition.
 

Quite right but every non-memorable class is also a bit like a jazz composition, namely one that was expensive, took an hour to drive to (15 minutes just to find parking) and at the end of the day wasn’t very memorable. The correct conclusion to draw from the analogy between live teaching and live music is that at their best both are great but both are also costly and inefficient ways of delivering most teaching and most musical experiences.
  
Excellent points (and Tabarrok has additional good points that I haven’t quoted).

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.

<p>Introduction: Joe Blitzstein and Xiao-Li Meng  write :
  
An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students’ knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.


Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and tw</p><p>3 0.86779886 <a title="516-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-Evaluating_Columbia_University%E2%80%99s_Frontiers_of_Science_course.html">1864 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-Evaluating Columbia University’s Frontiers of Science course</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rachel Schutt (the author of the Taxonomy of Confusion)  has a blog!  for the course she’s teaching at Columbia, “Introduction to Data Science.”  It sounds like a great course—I wish I could take it!
 
Her latest post is “On Inspiring Students and Being Human”:
 
   
  
Of course one hopes as a teacher that one will inspire students . . . But what I actually mean by “inspiring students” is that you are inspiring me; you are students who inspire: “inspiring students”. This is one of the happy unintended consequences of this course so far for me.
  
She then gives examples of some of the students in her class and some of their interesting ideas:

<p>Introduction: In politics we’re familiar with the non-apology apology (well described in Wikipedia as “a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express the expected contrition”).  Here’s the scientific equivalent:  the non-retraction retraction.
 
Sanjay Srivastava  points  to an amusing yet barfable story of a pair of researchers who (inadvertently, I assume) made a data coding error and were eventually moved to issue a correction notice, but even then refused to fully admit their error.  As Srivastava puts it, the story “ended up with Lew [Goldberg] and colleagues [Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton] publishing a comment on an erratum – the only time I’ve ever heard of that happening in a scientific journal.”
 
From the  comment  on the erratum:
  
In their “erratum and addendum,” Anderson and Ones (this issue) explained that we had brought their attention to the “potential” of a “possible” misalignment and described the results computed from re-aligned data as being based on a “post-ho</p><p>2 0.94629931 <a title="516-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-%E2%80%9CGenomics%E2%80%9D_vs._genetics.html">303 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-“Genomics” vs. genetics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>same-blog 3 0.9288727 <a title="516-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-14-A_new_idea_for_a_science_core_course_based_entirely_on_computer_simulation.html">516 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-14-A new idea for a science core course based entirely on computer simulation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta points me to  “EigenBracket 2012: Using Graph Theory to Predict NCAA March Madness Basketball”  and writes, “I [Folta] have got to believe that he’s simply re-invented a statistical method in a graph-ish context, but don’t know enough to judge.”
 
I have not looked in detail at the method being presented here—I’m not much of college basketball fan—but I’d like to use this as an excuse to make one of my favorite general point, which is that a good way to characterize any statistical method is by what information it uses. 
   
The basketball ranking method here uses score differentials between teams in the past season.  On the plus side, that is better than simply using one-loss records (which (a) discards score differentials and (b) discards information on who played whom).  On the minus side, the method appears to be discretizing the scores (thus throwing away information on the exact score differential) and doesn’t use any external information such as external ratings.

 Razib Khan  asks:
  
But follow the gradient from El Paso to the Illinois-Missouri border. The differences are small across state lines, but the consistent differences along the borders really don’t make. Are there state-level policies or regulations causing this? Or, are there state-level differences in measurement? This weird pattern shows up in other CDC data I’ve seen.

  
Turns out that CDC isn’t providing  data , they’re providing  model . Frank Howland answered: 
  

I suspect the answer has to do with the manner in which the county estimates are produced. I went to the original data source, the CDC, and then to the  relevant FAQ .


There they say that the diabetes prevalence estimates come from the “CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program. The BRFSS is an ongoing, monthly, state-based telephone survey of the adult population.

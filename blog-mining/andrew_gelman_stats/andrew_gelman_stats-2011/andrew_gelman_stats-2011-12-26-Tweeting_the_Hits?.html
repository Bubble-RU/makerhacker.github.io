<p>Introduction: Apparently some of our new blog entries are appearing as old entries on the RSS feed, meaning that those of you who read the blog using RSS may be missing a lot of good stuff.  We’re working on this.  But, in the meantime, I recommend you click on  the blog itself  to see what’s been posted in the last few weeks.  Enjoy.</p><p>3 0.098683327 <a title="1084-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-12-How_tall_is_Jon_Lee_Anderson%3F.html">1759 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-12-How tall is Jon Lee Anderson?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The second best thing about  this story  (from Tom Scocca) is that Anderson spells “Tweets” with a capital T.
 
But the best thing is that Scocca is numerate—he compares numbers on the logarithmic scale:
  
Reminding Lake that he only had 169 Twitter followers was the saddest gambit of all. Jon Lee Anderson has 17,866 followers. And Kim Kardashian has, as I write this, 17,489,892 followers. That is: Jon Lee Anderson is 1/1,000 as important on Twitter, by his own standard, as Kim Kardashian. He is 10 times closer to Mitch Lake than he is to Kim Kardashian.
  
How often do we see a popular journalist who understands orders of magnitude?  Good job, Tom Scocca!
 
P.S.  Based on his “little twerp” comment, I also wonder if Anderson suffers from tall person syndrome—that’s the problem that some people of above-average height have, that they think they’re more important than other people because they literally look down on them.  Don’t get me wrong—I have lots of tall friends who are complete</p><p>4 0.092756256 <a title="1084-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-27-99%21.html">1394 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-27-99!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was talking with someone the other day about the book by that Yale law professor who called her kids “garbage” and didn’t let them go to the bathroom when they were studying piano . . . apparently it wasn’t so bad as all that, she was  misrepresented  by the Wall Street Journal excerpt:
  
“I was very surprised,” she says. “The Journal basically strung together the most controversial sections of the book. And I had no idea they’d put that kind of a title on it. . . . “And while it’s ultimately my responsibility — my strict Chinese mom told me ‘never blame other people for your problems!’ — the one-sided nature of the excerpt has really led to some major misconceptions about what the book says, and about what I really believe.”
  
I don’t completely follow her reasoning here:  just because, many years ago, her mother told her a slogan about not blaming other people, therefore she can say, “it’s ultimately my responsibility”?  You can see the illogic of this by flipping it around.

<p>Introduction: Dave Kane writes:
  
I [Kane] am involved in a dispute relating to whether or not a blog can be considered part of one’s academic writing.  Williams College restricts the use of undergraduate theses as follows:

 
Non-commercial, academic use within the scope of “Fair Use” standards is acceptable. Otherwise, you may not copy or distribute any content without the permission of the copyright holder.
 

Seems obvious enough. Yet some folks think that my use of thesis material in a blog post fails this test because it is not “academic.” See  this post  for the gory details.
      
Parenthetically, your readers might be interested in the substantive discovery here, the details of the Williams admissions process (which is probably very similar to Columbia’s). Williams places students into academic rating (AR) categories as follows:

<p>Introduction: I was thinking a bit more about  Jonathan Rauch’s lament  about the fading of  the buggy-whip industry  print journalism, in which he mocks bloggers, analogizes blogging to scribbling with spray paint on the side of a building, and writes that the blogosphere is “the single worst medium for sustained, and therefore grown-up, reading and writing and argumentation ever invented.”
 
Yup.  Worse than talk radio.  Worse than cave painting.  Worse than smoke signals, rock ‘n’ roll lyrics, woodcuts, spray-paint graffiti, and every other medium of communication ever invented.
 
OK, he didn’t really mean it.  Rauch actually has an ironclad argument here.  He’s claiming, in a blog, that blogging is crap.  Therefore, if he fills his blog with unsupported exaggerations, that’s fine, as he’s demonstrating that blogging is . . . crap.
 
Not to pile on, but, hey, why not?  I was curious what Rauch has blogged on lately, so I googled Jonathan Rauch blog and ended up at  this site , which most recently</p><p>4 0.80777407 <a title="1084-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-09-The_guy_behind_me_on_line_for_the_train_._._..html">1796 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-09-The guy behind me on line for the train . . .</a></p>

I only wish I had a good ear for dialogue and could get it down for you.  OK, we don’t use the word fuck on this blog but I could substitute something like f*** and you’d get the point.

<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of googling myself (I know, I know . . .) and came across a couple of rude bloggers criticizing something I’d written.  I don’t mind criticism, and lord knows I can be a rude blogger myself at times, but these criticisms were really bad, a mix of already-refuted arguments and new claims that were just flat-out ridiculous.  Really bad stuff.  I then spent about an hour, on and off, writing a long long post explaining why they were wrong and how they could make their arguments better.  But then, before I hit Send, I realized it would a mistake to post my response.  Getting into a fight with these people whom I’d never heard of before . . . what’s the point?  If they want to comment on my blog, I will respond (within reason), or if they are well known researchers or journalists, it’s perhaps worth correcting them.  Or if they made an interesting argument, sure.  But there’s no point in scouring the web looking for  bad  arguments to refute.  That way lies madness.

<p>Introduction: Someone sent me an email saying that he liked my little essay, “Descriptive statistics aren’t just for losers.”  I had no idea what he was talking about, but it sounded like the kind of thing I’d say, so I searched the blog and found  this post , which indeed I really like!
 
I thanked my correspondent for reminding me of this little article I’d forgotten, and he told me he just learned of it via someone’s tweet.
 
This made me think:  Maybe I should have a twitter feed of nothing but old blog entries.  I could just go back to 2004 and then go gradually forward, tweeting the items that I judge to remain of interest.
 
Does this make sense?  Or is there a better way to do this?  ALternatively, I could do it as a separate blog, but that seems a bit . . . recursive.</p><p>2 0.84207273 <a title="1084-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-28-A_convenience_sample_and_selected_treatments.html">1551 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-28-A convenience sample and selected treatments</a></p>

A study has recently been  published  in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) which uses survival analysis to examine long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices [IUDs]) vs. short-term commonly prescribed methods of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptive pills) on unintended pregnancies.


The authors use a convenience sample of over 7,000 women.  I am not well versed-enough in sampling theory to determine the appropriateness of this but it would seem that the use of a non-probability sampling would be a significant drawback.  If you could give me your opinion on this, I would appreciate it.


The NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the country.  Could this type of sampling method coupled with this method of analysis be published in a journal like JASA?
  
My reply:  There are two concerns, first that it is a convenience sample and thus not representative of the population, and second that the treatments are chosen rather tha</p><p>3 0.83393776 <a title="1084-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-02-Roads%2C_traffic%2C_and_the_importance_in_decision_analysis_of_carefully_examining_your_goals.html">988 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-02-Roads, traffic, and the importance in decision analysis of carefully examining your goals</a></p>

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.  Sure, traffic congestion is annoying, but there must be some advantages to driving on that crowded road or pe</p><p>4 0.80812573 <a title="1084-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-06-Stephen_Kosslyn%E2%80%99s_principles_of_graphics_and_one_more%3A__There%E2%80%99s_no_need_to_cram_everything_into_a_single_plot.html">1609 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-06-Stephen Kosslyn’s principles of graphics and one more:  There’s no need to cram everything into a single plot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jerzy Wieczorek has an interesting  review  of the book Graph Design for the Eye and Mind by psychology researcher Stephen Kosslyn. I recommend you read all of Wieczorek’s review (and maybe Kosslyn’s book, but that I haven’t seen), but here I’ll just focus on one point. Here’s Wieczorek summarizing Kosslyn:
  

p. 18-19: the horizontal axis should be for the variable with the “most important part of the data.” See Kosslyn’s Figure 1.6 and 1.7 below. Figure 1.6 clearly shows that one of the sex-by-income groups reacts to age differently than the other three groups do. Figure 1.7 uses sex as the x-axis variable, making it much harder to see this same effect in the data. 
As a statistician exploring the data, I might make several plots using different groupings… but for communicating my results to an audience, I would choose the one plot that shows the findings most clearly.

<p>Introduction: Sandy Gordon sends along this  fun little paper  forecasting the 2010 midterm election using expert predictions (the Cook and Rothenberg Political Reports).  Gordon’s gimmick is that he uses past performance to calibrate the reports’ judgments based on “solid,” “likely,” “leaning,” and “toss-up” categories, and then he uses the calibrated versions of the current predictions to make his forecast.
 
As I wrote a  few weeks ago  in response to Nate’s forecasts, I think the right way to go, if you really want to forecast the election outcome, is to use national information to predict the national swing and then do regional, state, and district-level adjustments using whatever local information is available.  I don’t see the point of using  only  the expert forecasts and no other data.
 
Still, Gordon is bringing new information (his calibrations) to the table, so I wanted to share it with you.  Ultimately I like the throw-in-everything approach that Nate uses (although I think Nate’s descr</p><p>6 0.78273308 <a title="1084-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-29-A_Ph.D._thesis_is_not_really_a_marathon.html">1351 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-29-A Ph.D. thesis is not really a marathon</a></p>

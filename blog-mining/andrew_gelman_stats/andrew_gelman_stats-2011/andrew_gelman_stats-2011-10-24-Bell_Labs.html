I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.

I just read your  review  of Gertnerâ&euro;&trade;s book.  I agree with most of what you say re Bell labs.


I worked in the research area from 1964 to 1992 having arrived in what I regarded as a sort of heaven after 10 years in industrial research elsewhere. For much of that time I headed the Materials Science Research Dept. in the Solid State Electronics Laboratory. For a large number of the senior staff the eight hour day was the exception, not the rule, and even on weekends the parking lot was often 1/4 full. Most of the people I worked with were self driven and loved their work and the opportunities the Labs. provided to be maximally scientifically productive. Even during lunch in the cafeteria productive interactions were a common occurrence. I could go on and on, but just wanted to thank you for bring back pleasant memories of a long and productive career at Bell Labs after 20 years in retirement.

<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.

<p>Introduction: I studied math and physics at MIT. To be more precise, I started in math as default–ever since I was two years old, I’ve thought of myself as a mathematician, and I always did well in math class, so it seemed like a natural fit.
 
But I was concerned. In high school I’d been in the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad training program, and there I’d met kids who were clearly much much better at math than I was. In retrospect, I don’t think I was as bad as I’d thought at the time: there were 24 kids in the program, and I was probably around #20, if that, but I think a lot of the other kids had more practice working on “math olympiad”-type problems. Maybe I was really something like the tenth-best in the group.
 
Tenth-best or twentieth-best, whatever it was, I reached a crisis of confidence around my sophomore or junior year in college. At MIT, I started right off taking advanced math classes, and somewhere along the way I realized I wasn’t seeing the big picture. I was able to do the homework pr</p><p>6 0.18445049 <a title="970-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-12-The_Naval_Research_Lab.html">1261 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-12-The Naval Research Lab</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.  The input is the heat from solar radiation (easy enough to compute given the trajectory).

<p>Introduction: I met Seth back in the early 1990s when we were both professors at the University of California.  He sometimes came to the statistics department seminar and we got to talking about various things; in particular we shared an interest in statistical graphics.  Much of my work in this direction eventually went toward the use of graphical displays to understand fitted models.  Seth went in another direction and got interested in the role of exploratory data analysis in science, the idea that we could use graphs not just to test or even understand a model but also as the source of new hypotheses.  We continued to discuss these issues over the years;  see here , for example.
 
At some point when we were at Berkeley the administration was encouraging the faculty to teach freshman seminars, and I had the idea of teaching a course on left-handedness.  I’d just read the book by Stanley Coren and thought it would be fun to go through it with a class, chapter by chapter.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Last summer my wife and I took a 3.5-month vacation that included a wide range of activities. When I got back, people would ask “what were the highlights or your trip?”, and I was somewhat at a loss: we had done so many things that were so different, many of which seemed really great…how could I pick? Someone said, wisely, that in six months or a year I’d be able to answer the question because some memories would be more vivid than others. They were right, and I was recently thinking back on our vacation and putting together a list of highlights — enjoyable in itself, but also worth doing to help plan future vacations.
 
One of the things we did was go to four evenings of track and field events at the London Olympics. After we got back, people would ask what we had seen at the Olympics. I would say “We saw Usain Bolt run the 200m, we saw the women’s 4x100m relay and the men’s 4×400, we saw the last events of the decathlon…lots of great stuff.

<p>Introduction: We often hear that at the end of life, people often wish they hadn’t worked so hard.  (I’m assuming this is coming from executive types who have the option of working less, not people who had to work hard just to put food on the table.)
 
I don’t understand this.  Work is ok, but in almost any moment I much prefer relaxing to working.  Nonetheless I often wish I were working harder or had worked harder.  I don’t feel that I work too much.
 
So I don’t know what to think.  Am I just unusual?  Or maybe I already don’t work so hard, so there’s nothing for me to regret?  Or—and this is the scary option—maybe  right now  I wish I were working harder, but in twenty years I’ll regret that I spent so much time working?
 
Here’s one thing.  I like almost all the research papers I’ve written, but the vast majority (including some of my favorites) have had very few citations and, I assume, very little impact.  So maybe I worked too hard on some of them?</p><p>6 0.81055546 <a title="970-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-%E2%80%9CTo_Rethink_Sprawl%2C_Start_With_Offices%E2%80%9D.html">1029 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-“To Rethink Sprawl, Start With Offices”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>2 0.98850662 <a title="970-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-10-The_last_great_essayist%3F.html">197 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-10-The last great essayist?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently read a bizarre  article  by Janet Malcolm on a murder trial in NYC.  What threw me about the article was that the story was utterly commonplace (by the standards of today’s headlines):  divorced mom kills ex-husband in a custody dispute over their four-year-old daughter.  The only interesting features were (a) the wife was a doctor and the husband were a dentist, the sort of people you’d expect to sue rather than slay, and (b) the wife hired a hitman from within the insular immigrant community that she (and her husband) belonged to.  But, really, neither of these was much of a twist.
 
To add to the non-storyness of it all, there were no other suspects, the evidence against the wife and the hitman was overwhelming, and even the high-paid defense lawyers didn’t seem to be making much of an effort to convince anyone of their client’s innocents.  (One of the closing arguments was that one aspect of the wife’s story was so ridiculous that it  had  to be true.  In the lawyer’s wo</p><p>3 0.98847187 <a title="970-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-Setting_aside_the_politics%2C_the_debate_over_the_new_health-care_study_reveals_that_we%E2%80%99re_moving_to_a_new_high_standard_of_statistical_journalism.html">1838 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-Setting aside the politics, the debate over the new health-care study reveals that we’re moving to a new high standard of statistical journalism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pointing to this  news article  by Megan McArdle discussing a recent study of Medicaid recipients, Jonathan Falk writes:
  
Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.
 

and

 
A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: Sharad had a survey sampling question:
  
We’re trying to use mechanical turk to conduct some surveys, and have quickly discovered that turkers tend to be quite young. We’d really like a representative sample of the U.S., or at the least be able to recruit a diverse enough sample from turk that we can post-stratify to adjust the estimates. The approach we ended up taking is to pay turkers a small amount to answer a couple of screening questions (age & sex), and then probabilistically recruit individuals to complete the full survey (for more money) based on the estimated turk population parameters and our desired target distribution. We use rejection sampling, so the end result is that individuals who are invited to take the full survey look as if they came from a representative sample, at least in terms of age and sex. I’m wondering whether this sort of technique—a two step design in which participants are first screened and then probabilistically selected to mimic a target distributio</p><p>5 0.98547351 <a title="970-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-11-Steve_Jobs%E2%80%99s_cancer_and_science-based_medicine.html">953 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-11-Steve Jobs’s cancer and science-based medicine</a></p>

I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.

I was thinking about this after encountering (amidst a Google search for something else)  this article  on a website called “College News”:
  
DANVILLE, KY., March 8, 2007–Two Centre College professors spent the past six years reading and analyzing 200 children’s books to discover a disturbing trend: gender bias still exists in much of modern children’s literature.


Dr. David Anderson, professor of economics, and Dr. Mykol Hamilton, professor of psychology, have documented that gender bias is common today in many children’s books in their research published recently in Sex Roles: A Journal of Research titled “Gender Stereotyping and Under-Representation of Female Characters in 200 Popular Children’s Picture Books: A 21st Century Update.” . . .

<p>Introduction: George Leckie writes: 
  
  
The Centre for Multilevel Modelling at the University of Bristol is seeking to appoint an applied statistician to work on a new ESRC-funded project, Longitudinal Effects, Multilevel Modelling and Applications (LEMMA 3). LEMMA 3 is one of six Nodes of the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). The LEMMA 3 Node will focus on methods for the analysis of longitudinal data.


The appointment, at Research Assistant or Research Associate level, will be for 2.5 years with likelihood of extension to the end of September 2014.

<p>Introduction: That cute picture is of toddler FDR in a dress, from 1884.  Jeanne Maglaty  writes :
  
A Ladies’ Home Journal article [or maybe from a different source, according to a commenter] in June 1918 said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.


In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene’s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle’s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.


Today’s color dictate wasn’t established until the 1940s . . .

<p>Introduction: According to  Chris Wilson , there are two versions of the report of the Occupy Wall Street poll from  so-called  hack pollster Doug Schoen.
 
 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.
 
P.S.   More here  from Kaiser Fung on fundamental flaws with Schoen’s poll.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87356615 <a title="595-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-28-What_Zombies_see_in_Scatterplots.html">595 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-28-What Zombies see in Scatterplots</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This video caught my interest –  news video clip   
(from this

The news commentator did seem to be trying to point out what a couple of states had to say about the claimed relationship – almost on their own. 
 
Some  methods  have been worked out for zombies to do just this!
 
So I grabbed the data as close as I quickly could, modified the code slightly and here’s the zombie veiw of it.

North Carolina is the bolded red curve, Idaho the bolded green curve. 
Missisipi and New York are the bolded blue.
 
As ugly as it is this is the Bayasian marginal picture – exactly (given MCMC errror).
 
K? 
p.s. you will get a very confusing picture if you forget to centre the x (i.e. see chapter 4 of Gelman and Hill book)</p><p>4 0.82723701 <a title="595-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-21-New_search_engine_for_data_%26_statistics.html">724 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-21-New search engine for data & statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jon Goldhill points us to a new search engine,  Zanran , which is for finding data and statistics.  Goldhill writes:
  
It’s useful when you’re looking for a graph/table rather than a single number.  For example, if you look for ‘teenage births rates in the united states’ in Zanran you’ll see a series of graphs.  If you check in Google, there’s plenty of material – but you’d have to open everything up to see if it had any real numbers.  (I hope you’ll appreciate Zanran’s preview capability as well – hovering over the icons gives a useful preview of the content.)</p><p>5 0.79900324 <a title="595-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-04-Columbo_does_posterior_predictive_checks.html">1521 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-04-Columbo does posterior predictive checks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m already on record as saying that  Ronald Reagan was a statistician  so I think this is ok too . . .
 
   
 
Here’s what Columbo does.  He hears the killer’s story and he takes it very seriously (it’s murder, and Columbo never jokes about murder), examines all its implications, and finds where it doesn’t fit the data.  Then Columbo carefully examines the discrepancies, tries some model expansion, and eventually concludes that he’s proved there’s a problem.
 
OK, now you’re saying:  Yeah, yeah, sure, but how does that differ from any other fictional detective?  The difference, I think, is that the tradition is for the detective to find clues and use these to come up with hypotheses, or to trap the killer via internal contradictions in his or her statement.  I see Columbo is different—and more in keeping with chapter 6 of Bayesian Data Analysis—in that he is taking the killer’s story seriously and exploring all its implications.  That’s the essence of predictive model checking:  you t</p><p>6 0.78078544 <a title="595-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-14-Higgs_bozos%3A__Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_are_spinning_in_their_graves.html">1058 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-14-Higgs bozos:  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are spinning in their graves</a></p>

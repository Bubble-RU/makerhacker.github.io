<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Jennifer Hill (New York University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is funded by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences.  Other collaborators on the project include Jingchen Liu and Ben Goodrich.  This is a two-year position that would start this summer (2011) or earlier if possible.
 
The ideal candidate will have a statistics or computer science background, will be interested in statistical modeling, serious programming, and applications.  He or she should be able to work fluently in R and should already know about hierarchical models and Bayesian inference and computation.  Experience or interest in designing GUIs would be a bonus, since we are attempting to improve our GUI for missing data imputation.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Gelman (Columbia University) and Eric Johnson (Columbia University) seek to hire a post-doctoral fellow to work on the application of the latest methods of multilevel data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem:  forecasting retail sales at the individual item level.  These forecasts are used to make ordering, pricing and promotions decisions which can have significant economic impact to the retail chain such that even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions, across a large retailerâ&euro;&trade;s product line, can yield substantial margin improvements.
 
Activities focus on the development of iterative imputation algorithms and diagnostics for missing-data imputation.   Activities would include model-development, programming, and data analysis.  This project is to be undertaken with, and largely funded by, a firm which provides forecasting technology and services to large retail chains, and which will provide access to a unique and rich</p><p>3 0.93317103 <a title="537-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-01-Two_Postdoc_Positions_Available_on_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Modeling.html">62 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-01-Two Postdoc Positions Available on Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Postdoc #1. Hierarchical Modeling and Computation: We are fitting hierarchical regression models with deep interactions. We’re working on new models with structured prior distributions, and this also requires advances in Bayesian computation. Applications include public opinion, climate reconstruction, and education research.
 
Postdoc #1 is funded by grants from the Department of Energy, Institute of Education Sciences, and National Science Foundation.
 
Postdoc #2. Hierarchical Modeling and Statistical Graphics: The goal of this research program is to investigate the application of the latest methods of multi-level data analysis, visualization and regression modeling to an important commercial problem: forecasting retail sales at the individual item level. These forecasts are used to make ordering, pricing and promotions decisions which can have significant economic impact to the retail chain such that even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions, across a large retailer’s</p><p>4 0.92467487 <a title="537-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-26-%E2%80%9CA_Vast_Graveyard_of_Undead_Theories%3A__Publication_Bias_and_Psychological_Science%E2%80%99s_Aversion_to_the_Null%E2%80%9D.html">1826 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-26-“A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories:  Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>5 0.92462492 <a title="537-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-26-Sleazy_sock_puppet_can%E2%80%99t_stop_spamming_our_discussion_of_compressed_sensing_and_promoting_the_work_of_Xiteng_Liu.html">2306 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-26-Sleazy sock puppet can’t stop spamming our discussion of compressed sensing and promoting the work of Xiteng Liu</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some asshole who has a bug up his ass about compressed sensing is spamming our  comments  with a bunch of sock puppets.  All from the same IP address:  “George Stoneriver,” Scott Wolfe,” and just plain “Paul,”  all saying pretty much the same thing in the same sort of broken English (except for Paul, whose post was too short to do a dialect analysis). “Scott Wolfe” is a generic sort of name, but a quick google search reveals nothing related to this topic. “George Stoneriver” seems to have no internet presence at all (besides the comments at this blog).  As for “Paul,” I don’t know, maybe the spammer was too lazy to invent a last name?
 
Our spammer spends about half his time slamming the field of compressed sensing and the other half pumping up the work of someone named Xiteng Liu.  There’s no excuse for this behavior.  It’s horrible, a true abuse of our scholarly community.
 
If Scott Adams wants to use a sock puppet, fine, the guy’s an artist and we should cut him some slack.

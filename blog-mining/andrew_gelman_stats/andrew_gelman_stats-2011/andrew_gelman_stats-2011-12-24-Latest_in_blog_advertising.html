Hello Andrew,


I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I’d like to make a proposal for your site. Please refer below.


We would like to place a simple text link ad on page http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/super_sam_fuld/  to link to *** with the key phrase ***.


We will incorporate the key phrase into a sentence so it would read well. Rest assured it won’t sound obnoxious or advertorial. We will then process the final text link code as soon as you agree to our proposal. 


We can offer you $200 for this with the assumption that you will keep the link “live” on that page for 12 months or longer if you prefer.


Please get back to us with a quick reply on your thoughts on this and include your Paypal ID for payment process.  Hoping for a positive response from you.

Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got. Also kindly note that I can buy 1 to 50 links from one site – so you should understand the scale of the project. If you have multiple sites with co</p><p>5 0.16013809 <a title="1080-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-17-Joanne_Gowa_scooped_me_by_22_years_in_my_criticism_of_Axelrod%E2%80%99s_Evolution_of_Cooperation.html">348 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-17-Joanne Gowa scooped me by 22 years in my criticism of Axelrod’s Evolution of Cooperation</a></p>

I just wanted to alert to this completely misinformed Politico article by Roger Simon, equating sampling theory with “magic.” Normally, I wouldn’t send you this, but I sent him a helpful email and he was a complete jerk about it.
  
Wow—this is really bad. It’s so bad I refuse to link to it. I don’t know who this dude is, but it’s pitiful. Andy Rooney could do better. And I don’t mean Andy Rooney in his prime, I mean Andy Rooney right now. The piece appears to be an attempt at jocularity, but it’s about 10 million times worse than whatever the worst thing is that Dave Barry has ever written.
 
My question to Neil Malhotra is . . . what made you click on this in the first place?

I want your comments and I don’t want you to waste your time.  So please just stop already with the links, and we’ll both be happier.

<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  by Alex Tabarrok (following up on an article by Rebecca Solnit) on the continuum between voluntarism (or, more generally, non-cash transactions) and markets with monetary exchange.  I just have a few comments of my own:
 
1.  Solnit writes of “the iceberg economy,” which she characterizes as “based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return . . . the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit.”  I just wonder whether “barter” completely fits in here.  Maybe it depends on context.  Sometimes barter is an informal way of keeping track (you help me and I help you), but in settings of low liquidity I could imagine barter being simply an inefficient way of performing an economic transaction.
 
2.  I am no expert on capitalism but my impression is that it’s not just about “competition and selfishness” but also is related to the</p><p>3 0.96109962 <a title="1080-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-One_way_that_psychology_research_is_different_than_medical_research.html">433 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-One way that psychology research is different than medical research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Justin Kinney writes:
  
Since your blog has discussed the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC) of Reshef et al., I figured you might want to see  the critique  that Gurinder Atwal and I have posted.


In short,  Reshef et al.’s central claim that MIC is “equitable” is incorrect.  


We [Kinney and Atwal] offer mathematical proof that the definition of “equitability” Reshef et al. propose is unsatisfiable—no nontrivial dependence measure, including MIC, has this property. Replicating the simulations in their paper with modestly larger data sets validates this finding. 


The heuristic notion of equitability, however, can be formalized instead as a self-consistency condition closely related to the Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability but MIC does not.  We therefore propose that simply estimating mutual information will, in many cases, provide the sort of dependence measure Reshef et al. seek.

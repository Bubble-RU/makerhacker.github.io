<p>Introduction: In reply to my  question , David MacKay writes:
  
You said that can imagine rounding up 9 to 10 – which would be elegant if we worked in base 10.


But in the UK we haven’t switched to base 10 yet, we still work in  dozens and grosses.  (One gross = 12^2 = 144.)  So I was taught (by John Skilling, probably) “a dozen samples are plenty”. 


Probably in an earlier draft of the book in 2001 I said “a dozen”, rather than “12″.  Then some feedbacker may have written and said “I don’t know what a dozen is”;  so then I sacrificed elegant language and replaced “dozen” by “12″, which  leads to your mystification. 


PS – please send the winner of your competition a free copy of my other book ( sewtha ) too, from me. 


PPS I see that Mikkel Schmidt [in your comments] has diligently found the correct answer, which I guessed above. I suggest you award the prizes to him.
  
OK, we’re just  giving  away books here!
 
P.S.   See here  for my review of MacKay’s book on sustainable energy.</p><p>3 0.13135582 <a title="710-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-08-Disagreeing_to_disagree.html">2237 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-08-Disagreeing to disagree</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was going to post yet one more discussion of our discussion of the discussion of the discussion of some paper that I don’t really care about, but then I was like, aaaahh, what’s the point?
 
So instead here’s a pointer to the first paper I ever published.  It’s the very last one on  this list .
 
 The backstory is here , and here’s a poorly labeled graph for you to laugh at:

<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who would like to remain anonymous:
  
A journal editor made me change all my figures into tables.  I complied, but I sent along one of your papers on the topic of figures versus tables.  I got the following email in response which I thought you’d find funny:

 
Yes, statisticians prefer figures over tables.  However, you are not writing this manuscript for statisticians.  Your audience will be clinicians, nurses, epidemiologists and public health professionals.
 
  
The funny thing is, I think of biomedical journals (Jama, etc) as being pretty good about using graphs to convey their main results.  They’re not as good as physicists, but they’re often better than statisticians!</p><p>5 0.092362553 <a title="710-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-13-A_departmental_wiki_page%3F.html">571 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-13-A departmental wiki page?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?
 
In the meantime, if anybody feels like setting up a wikipedia entry for the research of Columbia’s statistics faculty, that</p><p>6 0.09170533 <a title="710-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-09-Today_in_the_sister_blog.html">1049 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-09-Today in the sister blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Jinkins  writes :
  
The objective of this paper is to measure the relative importance of conspicous consumption to Americans and Chinese. To this end, I estimate the parameters of a utility function borrowed from recent theoretical work using American and Chinese data. The main parameter of interest governs the amount that individuals care about peer group beliefs regarding their welfare. Using survey data on the visibility of different good categories along with household budget surveys, I find that Chinese consumers care twice as much as American consumers about the beliefs of their peer group.
  
I came across this draft research manuscript by following the links back after Jinkins commented on our blog.  The framing of the paper is a bit more foundation-y and a bit less statistic-y than I’d prefer, but I guess that’s just the way they do things in economics, compared to statistics or (some) political science.  In any case, I wanted to point you to this paper, partly to let y</p><p>4 0.6127609 <a title="710-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-15-Fun_fight_over_the_Grover_search_algorithm.html">1120 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-15-Fun fight over the Grover search algorithm</a></p>

The Chappell et al. paper has 24 references but does not refer to my paper, even though their paper and mine are eerily similar. Compare them yourself. With the excellent Google and ArXiv search engines, I [Tucci] would say there is zero probability that none of its five authors knew about my paper before they wrote theirs.
  
Chappell  responds  in the comments:
  
Your paper is timestamped 2010; however the results of our paper was initially presented at the Cairns CQIQC conference in July 2008. . . . The intention of our paper is not a research article. It is a tutorial paper. . . . We had not seen your paper before. Our paper is based on the standard Grover search, not a fixed point search.

<p>Introduction: After blogging on quirky software pioneer  Richard Stallman , I thought it appropriate to write something about recently deceased quirky software pioneer John McCarthy, who, with the exception of being bearded, seems like he was the personal and political opposite of Stallman.
 
 Here’s  a page I found of  Stallman  McCarthy quotes (compiled by Neil Craig).  It’s a mixture of the reasonable and the unreasonable (ok, I suppose the same could be said of this blog!).
 
I wonder if he and Stallman ever met and, if so, whether they had an extended conversation.  It would be like matter and anti-matter! 
   
P.S.  I flipped through McCarthy’s pages and found one of my pet peeves.  See item 3  here , which sounds so plausible but is in fact  not true  (at least, not according to the National Election Study).  As McCarthy’s Stanford colleague Mo Fiorina can tell you, otherwise well-informed people believe all sorts of things about polarization that aren’t so.

<p>Introduction: When Sonia Sotomayor was nominated for the Supreme Court, and there was some discussion of having 6 Roman Catholics on the court at the same time, I  posted  the following historical graph:
 
 
 
It’s time for an update:
 
 
 
It’s still gonna take awhile for the Catholics to catch up. . . .
 
And this one might be relevant too:
 
 
 
It looks as if Jews and men have been overrepresented, also  Episcopalians  (which, as I noted earlier, are not necessarily considered Protestant in terms of religious doctrine but which I counted as such for the ethnic categorization).  Religion is an interesting political variable because it’s nominally about religious belief but typically seems to be more about ethnicity.</p><p>2 0.94083869 <a title="710-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-15-When_Does_a_Name_Become_Androgynous%3F.html">208 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-15-When Does a Name Become Androgynous?</a></p>

Slightly improved figures

And just the history part from my thesis – that some find interesting.

Restoring its historical lead in education is the most important but requires investing large sums in education–beginning with universal pre-school–and in complementary programs–including selected cash benefits for families with children–that aid children’s development.

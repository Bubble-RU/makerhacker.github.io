<p>Introduction: Josh Tenenbaum describes some new work modeling people’s physical reasoning as probabilistic inferences over intuitive theories of mechanics. 
  
A general-purpose capacity for “physical intelligence”—inferring physical properties of objects and predicting future states in complex dynamical scenes—is central to how humans interpret their environment and plan safe and effective actions.  The computations and representations underlying physical intelligence remain unclear, however. Cognitive studies have focused on mapping out judgment biases and errors, or on testing simple heuristic models suitable only for highly specific cases; they have not attempted to give general-purpose unifying models.  In computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics researchers have long sought to formalize common-sense physical reasoning but without success in approaching human-level competence.  Here we show that a wide range of human physical judgments can be explained by positing an “intuitive me</p><p>4 0.073364735 <a title="1091-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-25-Why_I_decided_not_to_be_a_physicist.html">2347 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-25-Why I decided not to be a physicist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As I’ve written before, I was a math and physics major in college but I switched to statistics because math seemed pointless if you weren’t the best (and I knew there were people better than me), and I just didn’t feel like I had a good physical understanding.
 
My lack of physical understanding comes up from time to time.  An example occurred the other day.  I was viewing a demonstration of Foucault’s pendulum and the guide said the period was something like 35 hours.  I was surprised, having always thought it had a 24-hour period.  Sure, I can understand it in words, but, even after reflecting on it for a minute, I couldn’t see my way to even an approximate derivation.  If I wanted to, I think I could go through the math (for example  here ), but I feel that if I really had the intuition, I wouldn’t need to.
 
I’m sure I have a lot more physical understanding than the average person but I don’t think I have enough to be a real physicist.</p><p>5 0.053854175 <a title="1091-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-15-Bayesian_statistical_pragmatism.html">662 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-15-Bayesian statistical pragmatism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rob Kass’s  article  on statistical pragmatism is scheduled to appear in  Statistical Science  along with some discussions.  Here are my comments.
 
I agree with Rob Kass’s point that we can and should make use of statistical methods developed under different philosophies, and I am happy to take the opportunity to elaborate on some of his arguments.
 
I’ll discuss the following: 
- Foundations of probability 
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests 
- Sampling 
- Subjectivity and belief 
- Different schools of statistics
  

 
 Foundations of probability.   Kass describes probability theory as anchored upon physical randomization (coin flips, die rolls and the like) but being useful more generally as a mathematical model.  I completely agree but would also add another anchoring point:  calibration.  Calibration of probability assessments is an objective, not subjective process, although some subjectivity (or scientific judgment) is necessarily involved in the choice of events used</p><p>6 0.053568374 <a title="1091-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-On_deck_this_week.html">2276 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-On deck this week</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  this discussion  from last month, computer science student and Judea Pearl collaborator Elias Barenboim expressed an attitude that hierarchical Bayesian methods might be fine in practice but that they lack theory, that Bayesians can’t succeed in toy problems.  I posted a P.S. there which might not have been noticed so I will put it here:
 
I now realize that there is some disagreement about what constitutes a “guarantee.”  In one of his comments, Barenboim writes, “the assurance we have that the result must hold as long as the assumptions in the model are correct should be regarded as a guarantee.”  In that sense, yes, we have guarantees!  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the result must hold if the assumptions in the model are correct.  We have lots of that in Bayesian Data Analysis (particularly in the first four chapters but implicitly elsewhere as well), and this is also covered in the classic books by Lindley, Jaynes, and others.  This sort of guarantee is indeed p</p><p>3 0.71482027 <a title="1091-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-04-Bayesian_Learning_via_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics.html">1443 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-04-Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</a></p>

In  this paper  by Sunjin Ahn, Anoop Korattikara, and Max Welling and  this paper  by Welling and Yee Whye The, there are some arguments on big data and the use of MCMC. Both papers have suggested improvements to speed up MCMC computations. I was wondering what your thoughts were, especially on this paragraph:

 
When a dataset has a billion data-cases (as is not uncommon these days) MCMC algorithms will not even have generated a single (burn-in) sample when a clever learning algorithm based on stochastic gradients may already be making fairly good predictions. In fact, the intriguing results of Bottou and Bousquet (2008) seem to indicate that in terms of “number of bits learned per unit of computation”, an algorithm as simple as stochastic gradient descent is almost optimally efficient. We therefore argue that for Bayesian methods to remain useful in an age when the datasets grow at an exponential rate, they need to embrace the ideas of the stochastic optimiz</p><p>4 0.70463705 <a title="1091-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-28-Plain_old_everyday_Bayesianism%21.html">1829 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-28-Plain old everyday Bayesianism!</a></p>

There is a  report  by Martin Tingley and Peter Huybers in Nature on the unprecedented high temperatures at northern latitudes (Russia, Greenland, etc). What is more interesting is the authors are have used a straightforward hierarchical Bayes model, and for the first time (as far as I can remember) the results are reported with a probability attached to them (P>0.99), as opposed to the usual p-value<0.01 business. This might be a sign that editors of big time science journals are welcoming Bayesian approaches.
  
I agree.  This is a good sign for statistical communication.  Here are the key sentences from the abstract:
  
Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600 years.

As I get interested in Bayesian approaches to statistics, I have one question I wondered if you would find interesting to address at some point on the blog.


What does Bayesian work look like in action across a field? From experience, I have some feeling for how ongoing debates evolve (or not) with subsequent studies in response to earlier findings. I wonder if you know how this happens in practice when multiple researchers are using Bayesian approaches. How much are previous findings built into priors? How much advance comes from model improvement? And in a social science field where self-selection and self-interest play a role, how are improved “treatment” effects incorporated and evaluated?


I thought you might know of a field where actual back and forth has been carried out mostly in the context of Bayesian analysis or inference, and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at an example as I think about my own field.

<p>Introduction: David Schminovich points me to  this paper  by Yu Lu, H. Mo, Martin Weinberg, and Neal Katz:
  
We believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape the observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions. The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. . . .
  
And here’s  another  from the same authors, this time on “Bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the K-band luminosity function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation.”

<p>Introduction: John Horton points to  Sims ‘s  comment on Angrist and Pischke :
  
Top of page 8—he criticizes economists for using clustered standard errors—suggests using multilevel models instead.
  
Awesome!  So now there are at least two Nobel prize winners in economics who’ve expressed skepticism about controlled experiments.  (I wonder if Sims is such a danger in a parking lot.)
 
P.S.  I’m still miffed that this journal didn’t invite  me  to comment on that article!</p><p>4 0.71121681 <a title="1091-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-10-I_don%E2%80%99t_think_we_get_much_out_of_framing_politics_as_the_Tragic_Vision_vs._the_Utopian_Vision.html">1892 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-10-I don’t think we get much out of framing politics as the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg writes:
  
Recently read your  blogpost on Pinker’s views regarding red and blue states . This might help you see where he’s coming from: The “conflict of visions” thing that Pinker repeats to likely refers to Thomas Sowell’s work in the books “Conflict of Visions” and “Visions of the anointed.” The “Conflict of visions” book is on  his top-5 favorite book list  and in a  Q&A; interview  he explains it as follows:

 
Q: What is the Tragic Vision vs. the Utopian Vision?


A: They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book “A Conflict of Visions.” According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are â€œproductsâ€ of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the f</p><p>5 0.70999217 <a title="1091-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-06-The_fractal_nature_of_scientific_revolutions.html">1709 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-06-The fractal nature of scientific revolutions</a></p>

I stumbled across your  blog entry  after googling on those terms. 


If I could comment on the closed entry [We had to shut off comments on old blog entries for reasons of spam --- ed.], I’d note: scientific revolutions are fractal; they’re also chaotic in their dynamics. Predictability when a particular scientific revolution will take hold—or be rejected—is problematic. I find myself wishing that Chaos Theory had been established when Kuhn wrote his essay.</p><p>6 0.70163679 <a title="1091-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-05-New_issue_of_Symposium_magazine.html">1969 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-05-New issue of Symposium magazine</a></p>

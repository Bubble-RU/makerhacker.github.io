Are you familiar with the work of Ai and Norton on interactions in logit/probit models? I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.


Ai, C.R. and Norton E.C. 2003. Interaction terms in logit and probit models. Economics Letters 80(1): 123-129.


A peer ref just cited this paper in reaction to a logistic model we tested and claimed that the “only” way to test an interaction in logit/probit regression is to use the cross derivative method of Ai & Norton. I’ve never heard of this issue or method. It leaves me wondering what the interaction term actually tests (something Ai & Norton don’t discuss) and why such an important discovery is not more widely known. Is this an issue that is of particular relevance to econometric analysis because they approach interactions from the difference-in-difference perspective?

Here’s my reply:
 
As I wrote in my Anova paper and in my book with Jennifer Hill, I do think that multilevel models can completely replace Anova.  At the same time, I think the central idea of Anova should persist in our understanding of these models.  To me the central idea of Anova is not F-tests or p-values or sums of squares, but rather the idea of predicting an outcome based on factors with discrete levels, and understanding these factors using variance components.
 
The continuous or categorical response thing doesn’t really matter so much to me.  I have no problem using a normal linear model for continuous outcomes (perhaps suitably transformed) and a logistic model for binary outcomes.

I wonder if you could provide some clarification on the correct way to calculate the finite-population standard deviations for interaction terms in your Bayesian approach to ANOVA (as explained in your 2005 paper, and Gelman and Hill 2007).


I understand that it is the SD of the constrained batch coefficients that is of interest, but in most WinBUGS examples I have seen, the SDs are all calculated directly as sd.fin<-sd(beta.main[]) for main effects and sd(beta.int[,]) for interaction effects,  where beta.main and beta.int are the unconstrained coefficients, e.g. beta.int[i,j]~dnorm(0,tau).


For main effects, I can see that it makes no difference, since the constrained value is calculated by subtracting the mean, and sd(B[]) = sd(B[]-mean(B[])).


But the conventional sum-to-zero constraint for interaction terms in linear models is more complicated than subtracting the mean (there are only (n1-1)*(n2-1) free coefficients for an interaction b/w factors with n1 a</p><p>5 0.13262534 <a title="823-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-09-Allowing_interaction_terms_to_vary.html">753 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-09-Allowing interaction terms to vary</a></p>

I am a 2nd year graduate student in political science at the University of Vienna. In my empirical research I often employ multilevel modeling, and recently I came across a situation that kept me wondering for quite a while. As I did not find much on this in the literature and considering the topics that you work on and blog about, I figured I will try to contact you.
      
The situation is as follows: in a linear multilevel model, there are two important individual level predictors (x1 and x2) and a set of controls. Let us assume that there is a theoretically grounded argument suggesting that an interaction between x1 and x2 should be included in the model (x1 * x2). Both x1 and x2 are let to vary randomly across groups. Would this directly imply that the coefficient of the interaction should also be left to vary across country? This is even more burning if there is no specific hypothesis on the variance of the conditional effect across countries.

We have been discussing the following two issues amongst ourselves, then with our methodological consultant for several days. However, we have not been able to arrive at a consensus. Consequently, we decided to seek an opinion from nationally known experts. FYI, we sent a similar inquiry to Larry Hedges and David Rogosa . . .  


1)      We are wondering if a post-hoc covariate adjustment is a good practice in the context of RCTs [randomized clinical trials]. We have a situation where we found a significant baseline difference between the treatment and the control groups in 3 variables. Some of us argue that adding those three variables to the original impact analysis model is a good idea, as that would remove the confound from the impact estimate. Others among us, on the other hand, argue that a post-hoc covariate adjustment should never be done, on the ground that those covariates are correlated with the treatment, which makes the analysis model that of quasi</p><p>3 0.84780312 <a title="823-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-09-Sof%5Bt%5D.html">77 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-09-Sof[t]</a></p>

I’m working with linguistic data, specifically binomial hits and misses of a certain variable for certain words (specifically whether or not the “t” sound was pronounced at the end of words like “soft”). Word frequency follows a power law, with most words appearing just once, and with some words being hyperfrequent. I’m not interested in specific word effects, but I am interested in the effect of word frequency.


A logistic model fit is going to be heavily influenced by the effect of the hyperfrequent words which constitute only one type. To control for the item effect, I would fit a multilevel model with a random intercept by word, but like I said, most of the words appear only once.


Is there a principled approach to this problem?

I was wondering if multilevel models can be used as an alternative to 2SLS or IV models to deal with (i) endogeneity and (ii) selection problems.


More concretely, I am trying to assess the impact of investment treaties on foreign investment. Aside from the fact that foreign investment is correlated over time, it may be the case that countries that already receive sufficient amounts of foreign investment need not sign treaties, and countries that sign treaties are those that need foreign investment in the first place. Countries thus “select” into treatment; treaty signing is non-random. As such, I argue that to properly estimate the impact of treaties on investment, we must model the determinants of treaty signing.


I [Teo] am currently modeling this as two separate models: (1) regress predictors on likelihood of treaty signing, (2) regress treaty (with interactions, etc) on investment (I’ve thought of using propensity score matching for this part of the model)</p><p>5 0.79495233 <a title="823-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-Interactions_of_predictors_in_a_causal_model.html">251 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-Interactions of predictors in a causal model</a></p>

Let’s say we are interested in estimating breathing difficulty (measured on a continuous scale) and our main predictor is age of housing.  The object is to estimate whether living in housing 20 years or older is associated with breathing difficulty compared counterfactually to those living in housing less than 20 years old; as a secondary question, we want to know whether that effect differs for those in poverty compared to those not in poverty.  In our first-stage propensity model, we include whether the respondent lives in poverty.  The weights applied to the other covariates in the propensity model are similar to those living in poverty compared to those who are not.

<p>Introduction: José Iparraguirre writes:
  
There’s  a letter  in the latest issue of The Economist (July 31st) signed by Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), Michael Masters (Masters Capital Management) and David Frenk (Better Markets) about an    “>OECD report  on speculation and the prices of commodities, which includes the following: “The report uses a Granger causality test to measure the relationship between the level of commodities futures contracts held by swap dealers, and the prices of those commodities. Granger tests, however, are of dubious applicability to extremely volatile variables like commodities prices.”
  
The report says:
  
Granger causality is a standard statistical technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. It is important to bear in mind that the term causality is used in a statistical sense, and not in a philosophical one of structural causation. More precisely a variable A is said to Granger cause B if knowing the time paths of B and A toge</p><p>4 0.9155221 <a title="823-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-11-That_xkcd_cartoon_on_multiple_comparisons_that_all_of_you_were_sending_me_a_couple_months_ago.html">848 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-11-That xkcd cartoon on multiple comparisons that all of you were sending me a couple months ago</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Transue  sent it in  with the following thoughtful comment:
  
I’d imagine you’ve already received this, but just in case, here’s a cartoon you’d like. At first blush it seems to go against your advice (more nuanced than what I’m about to say by quoting the paper title) to not worry about multiple comparisons.


However, if I understand correctly your argument about multiple comparisons in multilevel models, the situation in this comic might have been avoided if shrinkage toward the grand mean (of all colors) had prevented the greens from clearing the .05 threshold. Is that right?</p><p>5 0.91412252 <a title="823-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-28-Argument_in_favor_of_Ddulites.html">1088 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-28-Argument in favor of Ddulites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  defines  a Ddulite as follows:
  
A preference for higher tech solutions even in cases where lower tech alternatives have greater and more appropriate functionality; a person of ddulite tendencies.


Though Ddulites are the opposite of Luddites with respect to attitudes toward technology, they occupy more or less the same point with respect to functionality.
  
As a sometime Luddite myself (no cell phone, tv, microwave oven, etc.), I should in fairness point out the logic in favor of being a Ddulite.  Old technology is typically pretty stable; new technology is improving.  It can make sense to switch early (before the new technology actually performs better than the old) to get the benefits of being familiar with the new technology once it does take off.</p><p>6 0.90476382 <a title="823-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-28-The_Supreme_Court%E2%80%99s_Many_Median_Justices.html">1234 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-28-The Supreme Court’s Many Median Justices</a></p>

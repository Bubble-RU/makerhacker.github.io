<p>Introduction: Larry Brownstein writes:
  
I read  your article  on induction and deduction and your comments on Deborah Mayo’s approach and thought you might find the following useful in this discussion. It is Wesley Salmon’s Reality and Rationality (2005). Here he argues that Bayesian inferential procedures can replace the hypothetical-deductive method aka the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He is concerned about the subjectivity problem, so takes a frequentist approach to the use of Bayes in this context.


Hardly anyone agrees that the H-D approach accounts for scientific explanation. The problem has been to find a replacement. Salmon thought he had found it.
  
I don’t know this book—but that’s no surprise since I know just about none of the philosophy of science literature that came after Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos.  That’s why I collaborated with Cosma Shalizi.  He’s the one who connected me to Deborah Mayo and who put in the recent philosophy references in our articles.

<p>Introduction: Continuing with  my discussion of the articles in the special issue  of the journal Rationality, Markets and Morals on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics:
 
   
 
Stephen Senn, “You May Believe You Are a Bayesian But You Are Probably Wrong”:
 
I agree with Senn’s comments on the impossibility of the de Finetti subjective Bayesian approach.  As I wrote in 2008, if you could really construct a subjective prior you believe in, why not just look at the data and write down your subjective posterior.  The immense practical difficulties with  any  serious system of inference render it absurd to think that it would be possible to just write down a probability distribution to represent uncertainty.  I wish, however, that Senn would recognize  my  Bayesian approach (which is also that of John Carlin, Hal Stern, Don Rubin, and, I believe, others).  De Finetti is no longer around, but we are!
 
I have to admit that my own Bayesian views and practices have changed.  In particular, I resonate wit</p><p>5 0.25418529 <a title="932-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-05-Error_statistics.html">890 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-05-Error statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: New blog  from the philosopher Deborah Mayo who I think agrees with me about many statistical issues although from a non-Bayesian perspective.
 
But I disagree with her when she  writes  that certain criticisms of frequentist statistical methods “keep popping up (verbatim) in every Bayesian textbook and article on philosophical foundations.”
 
I’ve written a couple of Bayesian textbooks and some articles on philosophical foundations, and I don’t think I do this!
 
That said, I think Mayo has a lot to say, so I wouldn’t judge her whole blog (let alone her published work) based on that one intemperate statement.</p><p>6 0.24668628 <a title="932-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-09-Coming_to_agreement_on_philosophy_of_statistics.html">1205 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-09-Coming to agreement on philosophy of statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My article with Cosma Shalizi has appeared in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.  I’m so glad this paper has come out.  I’d been thinking about writing such a paper for almost 20 years.  What got me to actually do it was an invitation a few years ago to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics for a volume on the philosophy of social sciences.  Once I started doing that, I realized I had enough for a journal article.  I contacted Cosma because he, unlike me, was familiar with the post-1970 philosophy literature (my knowledge went only up to Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos).  We submitted it to a couple statistics journals that didn’t want it (for reasons that weren’t always  clear ), but ultimately I think it ended up in the right place, as psychologists have been as serious as anyone in thinking about statistical foundations in recent years.
 
 Here’s the issue of the journal , which also includes an introduction, several discussions, and a rejoinder:

<p>Introduction: In  my remarks  on Arrow’s theorem (the weak form of Arrow’s Theorem is that any result can be published no more than five times. The strong form is that every result will be published five times), I meant no criticism of Bruno Frey, the author of the articles in question:  I agree that it can be a contribution to publish in multiple places.  Regarding the evaluation of contributions, it should be possible to evaluate research contributions and also evaluate communication.  One problem is that communication is both under- and over-counted.  It’s undercounted in that we mostly get credit for original ideas not for exposition; it’s overcounted in that we need communication skills to publish in the top journals.  But I don’t think these two biases cancel out.
 
The real reason I’m bringing this up, though, is because Arrow’s theorem happened to me recently and in interesting way.  Here’s the story.
 
Two years ago I was contacted by Harold Kincaid to write a chapter on Bayesian statistics</p><p>5 0.80043858 <a title="932-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-11-Why_waste_time_philosophizing%3F.html">1719 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-11-Why waste time philosophizing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll answer the above question after first sharing some background and history on the the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, which appeared at the end of our  rejoinder  to the discussion to which I  linked  the other day:
  
When we were beginning our statistical educations, the word ‘Bayesian’ conveyed membership in an obscure cult. Statisticians who were outside the charmed circle could ignore the Bayesian subfield, while Bayesians themselves tended to be either apologetic or brazenly defiant. These two extremes manifested themselves in ever more elaborate proposals for non-informative priors, on the one hand, and declarations of the purity of subjective probability, on the other.


Much has changed in the past 30 years. ‘Bayesian’ is now often used in casual scientific parlance as a synonym for ‘rational’, the anti-Bayesians have mostly disappeared, and non-Bayesian statisticians feel the need to keep up with developments in Bayesian modelling and computation. Bayesians themselves</p><p>6 0.7859382 <a title="932-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-26-Philosophy_and_the_practice_of_Bayesian_statistics.html">110 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-26-Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I only read the  review , not the book.  What puzzled me was not any  lack of self-awareness  but rather this bit:
  
The title of Mr. Rushdie’s new memoir . . . comes from the alias he assumed when British police told him back in 1989 that he needed a pseudonym: the Joseph comes from Joseph Conrad, the Anton from Anton Chekhov. The protection officers issued to him by the British government soon took to calling him “Joe,” an abbreviation he says he detested.
  
The thing that I don’t understand is why he detested the nickname.  If I were in a comparable situation, I think I’d appreciate if my security detail gave me a friendly nickname.  Then again, with the stress that Rushdie’s been under, I can imagine all sorts of personality transformations.</p><p>3 0.88163006 <a title="932-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-17-Horrible_but_harmless%3F.html">1581 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-17-Horrible but harmless?</a></p>

In re your recent  post : Can you make sense of  this ?
  
My reply: This is not the kind of thing that I like at all. But for some reason it doesn’t bother me enough for me to want to mock it. Perhaps because I sense that the people who write this sort of thing have very little power or influence.
 
Then again, a check of Wikipedia reveals that the author of the above article is “currently Professor and Bill Daniels Ethics Fellow, a past endowed Bank of America professor of management at New Mexico State University.” The connection between “Ethics Fellow” and “Bank of America professor of management,” that’s a bit creepy.</p><p>4 0.8702687 <a title="932-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-05-A_cloud_with_a_silver_lining.html">1198 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-05-A cloud with a silver lining</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For the past few weeks I’ve been in pain much of the time, some sort of spasms in my neck and shoulder.  Things are mostly better now, but last night I woke up at 5am and my neck was killing me.  On the upside, I’d just been having a dream about multiple imputation and in the dream I had a brilliant idea of how to reconcile conditional and joint model specifications.  Amazingly enough, when I awoke, I remembered the idea from the dream, and, even more amazingly, it really was a good idea.  And, I was in pain and couldn’t fall back asleep.  That was good news because that meant I didn’t forget the idea.  I mentioned it to Jingchen in our midday meeting today and he didn’t shoot it down.
 
At this point, I don’t really know what will happen.  Sometimes I have a sudden inspiration and is works out  just as planned  or even  better than anticipated ; other times, what seems like a brilliant plan goes nowhere.  For this new idea, the next step is the hard work of pushing it through and seei</p><p>5 0.85808361 <a title="932-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-30-Computer_models_of_the_oil_spill.html">243 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-30-Computer models of the oil spill</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Wilson points me to  this visualizatio n of three physical models of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Cool (and scary) stuff.  Wilson writes:
  
One of the major advantages is that the models are 3D and show the plumes and tails beneath the surface. One of the major disadvantages is that theyâ&euro;&trade;re still just models.</p><p>6 0.84682059 <a title="932-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-03-Redundancy_and_efficiency%3A__In_praise_of_Penn_Station.html">1245 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-03-Redundancy and efficiency:  In praise of Penn Station</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.13409239 <a title="641-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-12-Alert%3A__Incompetent_colleague_wastes_time_of_hardworking_Wolfram_Research_publicist.html">28 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-12-Alert:  Incompetent colleague wastes time of hardworking Wolfram Research publicist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Marty McKee at Wolfram Research appears to have a very very stupid colleague.  McKee  wrote  to Christian Robert:
  
Your article, “Evidence and Evolution: A review”, caught the attention of one of my colleagues, who thought that it could be developed into an interesting Demonstration to add to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.
  
As Christian points out, adapting his book review into a computer demonstration would be quite a feat!  I wonder what McKee’s colleague could be thinking?  I recommend that Wolfram fire McKee’s colleague immediately:  what an idiot!
 
P.S.  I’m not actually sure that McKee was the author of this email; I’m guessing this was the case because this other  very similar  email was written under his name.
 
P.P.S.  To head off the inevitable comments:  Yes, yes, I know this is no big deal and I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it.  But . . .

<p>Introduction: I post (approximately) once a day and don’t plan to change that.
 
I have enough material to post more often—for example, I could intersperse existing blog posts with summaries of my published papers or of other work that I like; and, beyond this, we currently have a one-to-two-month backlog of posts—but I’m afraid that if the number of posts were doubled, the attention given to each would be roughly halved.
 
Looking at it the other way, I certainly don’t want to  reduce  my level of posting.  Sure, it takes time to blog, but these are things that are important for me to say.  If I were to blog less frequently, it would only be because I was pouring all these words into a different vessel, for example a book.  For now, though, I think it makes sense to blog and then collect the words later as appropriate.  With blogging I get comments, and many of these comments are helpful—either directly (by pointing out errors in my thinking or linking to relevant software or literature) or indirec</p><p>5 0.11545596 <a title="641-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-30-%E2%80%9CPresidential_Election_Outcomes_Directly_Influence_Suicide_Rates%E2%80%9D.html">382 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-30-“Presidential Election Outcomes Directly Influence Suicide Rates”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This came in the spam the other day:
  
College Station, TX–August 16, 2010–Change and hope were central themes to the November 2008 U.S. presidential election. A new longitudinal study published in the September issue of  Social Science Quarterly   analyzes suicide rates at a state level from 1981ï¼2005 and determines that presidential election outcomes directly influence suicide rates among voters.


In states where the majority of voters supported the national election winner suicide rates decreased. However, counter-intuitively, suicide rates decreased even more dramatically in states where the majority of voters supported the election loser (4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 lower for females). This article is the first in its field to focus on candidate and state-specific outcomes in relation to suicide rates. Prior research on this topic focused on whether the election process itself influenced suicide rates, and found that suicide rates fell during the election season.

<p>Introduction: Our research assistants have unearthed the following guest column by H. L. Mencken which appeared in the New York Times of 5 Nov 1933, the date at which Prohibition ended in the United States. As a public service we are reprinting it here.
 
I’m particularly impressed at how the Sage of Baltimore buttressed his article with references to the latest scientific literature of the time. I think you’ll all agree that Mencken’s column, in which he took a stand against the legality of alcohol consumption, has  contemporary relevance , more than 80 years later.
 
Because of the challenge of interpreting decades-old references, we have asked a leading scholar of Mencken’s writings to add notes where appropriate, to clarify any points of confusion. And now here’s Mencken’s column (with notes added in brackets), in its entirety:

<p>Introduction: I was checking the Dilbert blog (sorry!  I was just curious what was up after  the events  of a few weeks ago) and saw this:
  
 
I [Scott Adams] wonder if any old-time racists still exist. I knew a few racists when I was a kid, back in upstate New York. In my adult life, I don’t think I’ve met one. . . . I certainly understand if you’ve witnessed it, or suffered from it. I’m just saying I haven’t seen it where I live. Clearly that sort of activity is distributed unevenly around the country.  Just to be clear: I’m only saying I haven’t personally witnessed overt racism in my adult life. I accept that you have seen it firsthand, if you say so.  Classic racism of the old-timey variety is probably only possible in people who don’t own television sets and haven’t gone through grade school. I’ll grant you that racist prison gangs and neo-Nazis exist. But obviously something else is going on with those guys. Let’s call them the exceptions. . . .

<p>Introduction: A couple things in  this interview  by Andrew Goldman of Larry Summers currently irritated me.
 
I’ll give the quotes and then explain my annoyance.
  
 
1.  Goldman: What would the economy look like now if $1.2 trillion had been spent?


Summers:  I think it’s an artificial question because there would have been all kinds of problems in actually moving $1.2 trillion dollars through the system — finding enough bridge projects that were ready to go and the like. But the recovery probably would have proceeded more rapidly if the fiscal program had been larger. . . .


2.  Goldman:  You’re aware of — and were making light of — the fact that you occasionally rub people the wrong way.


Summers:   In meetings, I’m more focused on trying to figure out what the right answer is than making everybody feel validated. In Washington and at Harvard, that sometimes rubs people the wrong way.
 

 
OK, now my reactions:
 
1.  Not enough bridge projects, huh?  I don’t believe it.  We’ve been hearing fo</p><p>5 0.83916396 <a title="641-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians_vs._everybody_else.html">582 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-20-Statisticians vs. everybody else</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Statisticians are literalists.
 
When someone says that the U.K. boundary commission’s delay in redistricting gave the Tories an advantage equivalent to 10 percent of the vote, we’re the kind of person who  looks it up  and claims that the effect is less than 0.7 percent.
 
When someone says, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican presidents in times of perceived danger and Democrats in times of relative calm,” we’re like, Hey, really?  And we go look  that one  up too.
 
And when someone says that engineers have more sons and nurses have more daughters . . . well, let’s not go there.
 
So, when I was pointed to  this blog  by Michael O’Hare making the following claim, in the context of K-12 education in the United States:
  
My [O'Hare's] favorite examples of this junk [educational content with no workplace value] are spelling and pencil-and-paper algorithm arithmetic.

<p>Introduction: Lets say you are repeatedly going to recieve unselected sets of well done RCTs on various say medical treatments.
 
One reasonable assumption with all of these treatments is that they are monotonic – either helpful or harmful for all. The treatment effect will (as always) vary for subgroups in the population – these will not be explicitly identified in the studies – but each study very likely will enroll different percentages of the variuos patient subgroups. Being all randomized studies these subgroups will be balanced in the treatment versus control arms – but each study will (as always) be estimating a different – but exchangeable – treatment effect (Exhangeable due to the ignorance about the subgroup memberships of the enrolled patients.) 
 
That reasonable assumption – monotonicity – will be to some extent (as always) wrong, but given that it is a risk believed well worth taking – if the average effect in any population is positive (versus negative) the average effect in any other</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96256989 <a title="641-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-01-So_many_topics%2C_so_little_time.html">641 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-01-So many topics, so little time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As many of you know, this blog is on an approximate one-month delay.  I schedule my posts to appear roughly once a day, and there’s currently a backlog of about 20 or 30 posts.
 
Recently I’ve decided to spend less time blogging, but I have some ideas I’d still like to share.  To tweet, if you will.  So I thought I’d just put a bunch of ideas out there that interested readers could follow up on.  Think of it like one of those old-style dot-dot-dot newspaper columns.
  

 
- One thing statisticians could learn from economists:  if you want to control for a continuous variable, throw it in as a fifth-order polynomial on the right hand side of a regression.  A lot of statisticians will either do simple linear or else spaz out with a spline.  But good old polynomials are fine.
 
- One thing that not so many political scientists realize is that nowadays the rich voters are Democrats!  You don’t always see that in surveys, but remember that survey nonresponse rates are typically 80%+.  Heck,</p><p>3 0.9608382 <a title="641-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-12-Sometimes_a_graph_really_is_just_ugly.html">798 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-12-Sometimes a graph really is just ugly</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been talking a lot about how different graphical presentations serve different goals, and how we should avoid being so judgmental about graphs.  Instead of saying that a particular data visualization is bad, we should think about what goal it serves.
 
That’s all well and good, but sometimes a graph really is bad.
 
Let me draw an analogy to the popular media.  Books and videogames serve different goals.  I’m a reader and writer of books and have very little interest in videogames, but it would be silly for me to criticize a videogame on the grounds that it’s a bad book (or, for that matter, to criticize a book because it doesn’t yield a satisfying game-playing experience).  But . . . there are bad books and there are bad videogames.
 
To restrict our scope to books for a moment:  you could argue that Mickey Spillane’s books are terrible or you could argue that, given that they sold tens of millions of copies, they must have had something going for them.  I wouldn’t want to charac</p><p>4 0.96015459 <a title="641-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-12-Samplers_for_Big_Science%3A__emcee_and_BAT.html">2020 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-12-Samplers for Big Science:  emcee and BAT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the past few months, we’ve talked about modeling with particle physicists ( Allen Caldwell ), astrophysicists ( David Hogg , who regularly comments here), and climate and energy usage modelers ( Phil Price , who regularly posts here).  
 
 Big Science Black Boxes 
 
We’ve gotten pretty much the same story from all of them:  their models involve “big science” components that are hugely complex and provided by outside implementations from labs like CERN or LBL. Some concrete examples for energy modeling are the  TOUGH2  thermal simulator, the EnergyPlus building energy usage simulator, and global climate model (GCM) implementations.
 
These models have the character of not only being black boxes, but taking several seconds or more to generate the equivalent of a likelihood function evaluation.  So we can’t use something like Stan, because nobody has the person years required to implement something like TOUGH2 in Stan (and Stan doesn’t have the debugging or modularity tools to suppor</p><p>5 0.9569782 <a title="641-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-05-Does_posterior_predictive_model_checking_fit_with_the_operational_subjective_approach%3F.html">320 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-05-Does posterior predictive model checking fit with the operational subjective approach?</a></p>

I have been thinking a lot lately about your Bayesian model checking approach.  This is in part because I have been working on exploratory data analysis and wishing to avoid controversy and mathematical statistics we omitted model checking from our discussion.  This is something that the refereeing process picked us up on and we ultimately added a critical discussion of null-hypothesis testing to  our paper .  The exploratory technique we discussed was essentially a 2D histogram approach, but we used Polya models as a formal model for the histogram.  We are currently working on a new paper, and we are thinking through how or if we should do “confirmatory analysis” or model checking in the paper.


What I find most admirable about your statistical work is that you clearly use the Bayesian approach to do useful applied statistical analysis.  My own attempts at applied Bayesian analysis makes me greatly admire your applied successes.

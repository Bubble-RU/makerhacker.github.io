<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>3 0.15603845 <a title="957-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-29-Question_19_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1352 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-29-Question 19 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 19. A survey is taken of students in a metropolitan area. At the first stage a school is sampled at random. The schools are divided into two strata: 20 private schools and 50 public schools are sampled. At the second stage, 5 classes are sampled within each sampled school. At the third stage, 10 students are sampled within each class. What is the probability that any given student is sampled? Express this in terms of the number of students in the class, number of classes in the school, and number of schools in the area. Define appropriate notation as needed.

From  yesterday :
  
18. A survey is taken of 100 undergraduates, 100 graduate students, and 100 continuing education students at a university. Assume a simple random sample within each group. Each student is asked to rate his or her satisfaction (on a 1â&euro;&ldquo;10 scale) with his or her experiences. Write the estimate and standard error of the average satisfaction of all the students at the university.

Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: Chris Blattman  writes :
  
Matching is not an identification strategy a solution to your endogeneity problem; it is a weighting scheme. Saying matching will reduce endogeneity bias is like saying that the best way to get thin is to weigh yourself in kilos. The statement makes no sense. It confuses technique with substance. . . . When you run a regression, you control for the X you can observe. When you match, you are simply matching based on those same X. . . .
  
I see what Chris is getting at–matching, like regression, won’t help for the variables you’re not controlling for–but I disagree with his characterization of matching as a weighting scheme.  I see matching as a way to restrict your analysis to comparable cases.  The statistical motivation:  robustness.  If you had a good enough model, you wouldn’t neet to match, you’d just fit the model to the data.  But in common practice we often use simple regression models and so it can be helpful to do some matching first before regress</p><p>6 0.13808608 <a title="957-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-01-%E2%80%9COn_Inspiring_Students_and_Being_Human%E2%80%9D.html">1517 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-01-“On Inspiring Students and Being Human”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Partly in response to my blog on the Harlem Children’s Zone study, Mark Palko wrote  this :
  
Talk of education reform always makes me [Palko] deeply nervous. Part of the anxiety comes having spent a number of years behind the podium and having seen the disparity between the claims and the reality of previous reforms. The rest comes from being a statistician and knowing what things like convergence can do to data.


Convergent behavior violates the assumption of independent observations used in most simple analyses, but educational studies commonly, perhaps even routinely ignore the complex ways that social norming can cause the nesting of student performance data.


In other words, educational research is often based of the idea that teenagers do not respond to peer pressure. . . .
  
and  this :
  
 
When you isolate a group of students, they will quickly arrive at a consensus of what constitutes normal behavior. It is a complex and somewhat unpredictable process driven by personali</p><p>3 0.81611043 <a title="957-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-24-Foreign_language_skills_as_an_intrinsic_good%3B_also%2C_beware_the_tyranny_of_measurement.html">484 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-24-Foreign language skills as an intrinsic good; also, beware the tyranny of measurement</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This link  on education reform send me to  this blog  on foreign languages in Canadian public schools:
  
 
The demand for French immersion education in Vancouver so far outstrips the supply that the school board allocates places by lottery.


But why? Is it because French is a useful employment skill? Because learning to speak French makes you a better person? Or is it because parents know intuitively what economists can show econometrically: peer effects matter. Being with high achieving peers raises a student’s own achievement level. . . .


Several studies have found that Anglophones who can speak French enjoy an earning premium. The question is: do bilingual Anglophones earn more because speaking French is a valuable skill in the workplace? Or do they earn more because they’re on average smarter and more capable people (after all, they’ve mastered two languages)?

<p>Introduction: Theodore Vasiloudis writes:
  
I came upon  this article  by Laura Hamilton, an assistant professor in the University of California at Merced, that claims that “The more money that parents provide for higher education, the lower the grades their children earn.”


I can’t help but feel that there something wrong with the basis of the study or a confounding factor causing this apparent correlation, and since you often comment on studies on your blog I thought you might find this study interesting.
  
My reply:  I have to admit that the description above made me suspicious of the study before I even looked at it.  On first thought, I’d expect the effect of parent’s financial contributions to be positive (as they free the student from the need to get a job during college), but not negative.  Hamilton argues that “parental investments create a disincentive for student achievement,” which may be—but I’m generally suspicious of arguments in which the rebound is bigger than the main effect.</p><p>5 0.78689414 <a title="957-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-More_on_those_L.A._Times_estimates_of_teacher_effectiveness.html">226 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-More on those L.A.

(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: Phil Harris and Bruce Smith write:
  
We have only recently chanced upon your blog while we were looking for responses to the “decline effect” in medical and scientific studies. We were especially taken by your comment that there is something wrong with the scientific method “if this method is defined as running experiments and doing data analysis in a patternless way and then reporting, as true, results that pass a statistical significance threshold.” To us, that seems to be standard operating procedure in much of social science, including our own field of education. Indeed quasi-experimental designs are the stock in trade of those who attempt to use “science” — we dare not say haruspicy, but you can if you like — to influence the course of public policy.


Now, a new entrant into the cherry pickers sweepstakes seems to have emerged. It is on  Charter School Performance in Indiana Schools .

<p>Introduction: From 2006 :
  
 Naseem Taleb ‘s publisher sent me a copy of “Fooled by randomness: the hidden role of chance in life and the markets” to review. It’s an important topic, and the book is written in a charming style—I’ll try to respond in kind, with some miscellaneous comments.


On the cover of the book is a blurb, “Named by Fortune one of the smartest books of all time.” But Taleb instructs us on page 161-162 to ignore book reviews because of selection bias (the mediocre reviews don’t make it to the book cover).


 Books vs. articles 


I prefer writing books to writing journal articles because books are written for the reader (and also, in the case of textbooks, for the teacher), whereas articles are written for referees. Taleb definitely seems to be writing to the reader, not the referee. There is risk in book-writing, since in some ways referees are the ideal audience of experts, but I enjoy the freedom in book-writing of being able to say what I really think.

 – Under the banner of objective Bayesianism, I would posit something like this as a description of Bayesian inference:


“Objective Bayesian probability is not a degree of belief (which would necessarily be subjective) but a measure of the plausibility of a hypothesis, conditional on a formally specified information state. One way of specifying a formal information state is to specify a model, which involves specifying both a prior distribution (typically for a set of unobserved variables) and a likelihood function (typically for a set of observed variables, conditioned on the values of the unobserved variables). Bayesian inference involves calculating the objective degree of plausibility of a hypothesis (typically the truth value of the hypothesis is a function of the variables mentioned above) given such a</p><p>4 0.98025751 <a title="957-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-07-Bing_is_preferred_to_Google_by_people_who_aren%E2%80%99t_like_me.html">2054 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-07-Bing is preferred to Google by people who aren’t like me</a></p>

Here’s the story:
 
Microsoft,  September 2012 :
  
An independent research company, Answers Research based in San Diego, CA, conducted a study using a representative online sample of nearly 1000 people, ages 18 and older from across the US. The participants were chosen from a random survey panel and were required to have used a major search engine in the past month. Participants were not aware that Microsoft was involved.  


In the test, participants were shown the main web search results pane of both Bing and Google for 10 search queries of their choice. Bing and Google search results were shown side-by-side on one page for easy comparison – with all branding removed from both search engines. The test did not include ads or content in other parts of the page such as Bing’s Snapshot and Social Search panes and Google’s Knowledge Graph.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Livengood writes:
  
I have a couple of questions on your paper with Cosma Shalizi on “Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics.”


First, you distinguish between inductive approaches and hypothetico-deductive approaches to inference and locate statistical practice (at least, the practice of model building and checking) on the hypothetico-deductive side.  Do you think that there are any interesting elements of statistical practice that are properly inductive?  For example, suppose someone is playing around with a system that more or less resembles a toy model, like drawing balls from an urn or some such, and where the person has some well-defined priors.  The person makes a number of draws from the urn and applies Bayes theorem to get a posterior.  On your view, is that person making an induction?  If so, how much space is there in statistical practice for genuine inductions like this?


Second, I agree with you that one ought to distinguish induction from other kind</p><p>6 0.97992027 <a title="957-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-09-A_tale_of_two_discussion_papers.html">1848 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-09-A tale of two discussion papers</a></p>

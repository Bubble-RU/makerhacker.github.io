Hi Mr. Carpenter,


I am a fourth year college student and I have the honor of reading one of your books and I just had a few questions… I am very fascinated by your work and I am just trying to understand everything. Can you please address some of my questions? I would greatly appreciate it. It certainly help me understand your wonderful article better. Thank you very much! :)


1. What is the fundamental purpose of your article?


2. What is your fundamental thesis?


3. What evidence do you use to support your thesis?


4. What is the overall conclusion?


5. Do you feel that you have a fair balance of opposing viewpoints?

</p><p>3 I see where she’s coming from–after all, asking someone else to do your homework for you really is against the rules–but, from the student’s perspective, sending an email to an article’s author is just a slightly enterprising step beyond scouring the web for something written on the article. [sent-22, score-0.438]

</p><p>5 - Even more annoying is the use of flattery or, perhaps I should say, the devaluing of compliments. [sent-32, score-0.3]
</p><p>6 I don’t know about Carpenter but, personally, I love love love when people sent me emails or come up to me at conferences and tell me how much they love my books or articles. [sent-33, score-0.62]
</p><p>7 Anyway, for some reason it feels fundamentally abusive to me for this student to be to trafficking in our understandable but somehow vaguely disreputable desire for love, fame, fortune, or whatever. [sent-42, score-0.366]
</p><p>8 It’s either insulting because the question is so rude, or (more likely) insulting because the student didn’t even bother to think about whether the question made sense before asking it. [sent-48, score-0.758]
</p><p>9 The student in question is “a public figure”–Carpenter didn’t supply any details–but in any case you’d want such a person to show a bit better judgment. [sent-51, score-0.386]
</p><p>10 That’s why I think I was so annoyed by  this email  that some asshole at Wolfram Research sent to Christian Robert, claiming that a scholarly article of his had “caught the attention of one of [the spammers] colleagues” when actually it was pretty clear that there was no such colleague involved.

</p><p>14 Anyway, my point here is not to revisit the battle of the fake emails or to again drag the good name of Wolfram Research through the mud. [sent-71, score-0.314]
</p><p>15 Rather, I’m just trying to trace what was so annoying about the original email Carpenter received. [sent-72, score-0.446]
</p><p>16 Ultimately, I don’t think it’s the cheating–after all, with a bit of care, a student could easily ask lots and lots of questions and get free responses by email–but the fake flattery and personal appeal which has the effect of devaluing actual positive reactions to her work. [sent-73, score-0.778]

</p><p>19 Asking the student for the name of the professor was another dead end, in my opinion. [sent-85, score-0.384]

<p>Introduction: As someone who relies strongly on survey research, it’s good for me to be reminded that some surveys are useful, some are useless, but one thing they almost all have in common is . . . they waste the respondents’ time.
 
I thought of this after receiving the following email, which I shall reproduce here.  My own comments appear after.
     
Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10 minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of the email appears below). We are emailing you today to debrief you on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study. We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced. Our hope is that this letter will provide a sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of our study to alleviate any concerns you may have about your involvement.

<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, the students in our Teaching Statistics class practiced one-on-one tutoring.  We paired up the students (most of them are second-year Ph.D. students in our statistics department), with student A playing the role of instructor and student B playing the role of a confused student who was coming in for office hours.  Within each pair, A tried to teach B (using pen and paper or the blackboard) for five minutes.  Then they both took notes on what worked and what didn’t work, and then they switched roles, so that B got some practice teaching.
 
While this was all happening, Val and I walked around the room and watched what they did.  And we took some notes, and wrote down some ideas:  In no particular order:
 
 Who’s holding the pen?   Mort of the pairs did their communication on paper, and in most of these cases, the person holding the pen (and with the paper closest to him/herself) was the teacher.  That ain’t right.  Let the student hold the pen.

<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  reported  on the spam email that I received from two business school professors (one at Columbia)!  As noted on the blog, I sent an email directly to the study’s authors at the time of reading the email, but they have yet to respond.
 
This surprises me a bit.  Certainly if 6300 faculty each have time to respond to one email on this study, the two faculty have time to respond to 6300 email replies, no?  I was actually polite enough to respond to  both  of their emails!  If I do hear back, I’ll let youall know!
 
P.S.  Paul Basken interviewed me briefly for  a story  in the Chronicle of Higher Education on the now-notorious spam email study.  Basken’s article is reasonable–he points out that (a) the study irritated a lot of people, but (b) is ultimately no big deal.  
 
One interesting thing about the article is that, although some people felt that the spam email study was ethical, nobody came forth with an argument that the study was actually worth doing.

<p>Introduction: This  is hilarious ( link  from a completely deadpan Tyler Cowen).  I’d call it “unintentionally hilarious” but I’m pretty sure that rms knew this was funny when he was writing it.  It’s sort of like when you write a  top 10  list—it’s hard to resist getting silly and going over the top.  It’s only near the end that we get to the bit about the parrots.
 
All joking aside, the most interesting part of the email was this:
  
I [rms] have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every day* doing my usual work, which is responding to email about the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement.
  
I’d wondered for awhile what is it that Richard Stallman actually does, that is how does he spend his time (aside from giving lectures to promote his ideas and pay the bills).
 
 Emailing –> Blogging 
 
I too spend a lot of time on email, but a few years ago I consciously tried to shift a bunch of my email exchanges to the blog.  I found that I was sending out a lot of information to an audience of one, information</p><p>5 0.75058371 <a title="605-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-12-Alert%3A__Incompetent_colleague_wastes_time_of_hardworking_Wolfram_Research_publicist.html">28 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-12-Alert:  Incompetent colleague wastes time of hardworking Wolfram Research publicist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Marty McKee at Wolfram Research appears to have a very very stupid colleague.  McKee  wrote  to Christian Robert:
  
Your article, “Evidence and Evolution: A review”, caught the attention of one of my colleagues, who thought that it could be developed into an interesting Demonstration to add to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.
  
As Christian points out, adapting his book review into a computer demonstration would be quite a feat!  I wonder what McKee’s colleague could be thinking?  I recommend that Wolfram fire McKee’s colleague immediately:  what an idiot!
 
P.S.  I’m not actually sure that McKee was the author of this email; I’m guessing this was the case because this other  very similar  email was written under his name.
 
P.P.S.  To head off the inevitable comments:  Yes, yes, I know this is no big deal and I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it.  But . . . Wolfram Research has contributed such great things to the world, that I hate to think of them wasting any money paying</p><p>6 0.74235123 <a title="605-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-06-Spam_names.html">2160 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-06-Spam names</a></p>

There’s  a letter  in the latest issue of The Economist (July 31st) signed by Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), Michael Masters (Masters Capital Management) and David Frenk (Better Markets) about an    “>OECD report  on speculation and the prices of commodities, which includes the following: “The report uses a Granger causality test to measure the relationship between the level of commodities futures contracts held by swap dealers, and the prices of those commodities. Granger tests, however, are of dubious applicability to extremely volatile variables like commodities prices.”
  
The report says:
  
Granger causality is a standard statistical technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. It is important to bear in mind that the term causality is used in a statistical sense, and not in a philosophical one of structural causation.

I’d imagine you’ve already received this, but just in case, here’s a cartoon you’d like. At first blush it seems to go against your advice (more nuanced than what I’m about to say by quoting the paper title) to not worry about multiple comparisons.


However, if I understand correctly your argument about multiple comparisons in multilevel models, the situation in this comic might have been avoided if shrinkage toward the grand mean (of all colors) had prevented the greens from clearing the .05 threshold. Is that right?</p><p>3 0.97366858 <a title="605-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-12-Finite-population_standard_deviation_in_a_hierarchical_model.html">464 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-12-Finite-population standard deviation in a hierarchical model</a></p>

My topic is regional variation in the cause-specific survival of breast cancer patients across the 21 hospital districts in Finland, this component being modeled by random effects. I am interested mainly in the district-specific effects, and with a hierarchical model I can get reasonable estimates also for sparsely populated districts.


Based on the recommendation given in the book by yourself and Dr. Hill (2007) I tend to think that the finite-population variance would be an appropriate measure to summarize the overall variation across the 21 districts. However, I feel it is somewhat incoherent first to assume a Normal distribution for the district effects, involving a “superpopulation” variance parameter, and then to compute the finite-population variance from the estimated district-specific parameters. I wonder whether the finite-population variance were more appropriate in the context of a model with fixed district effects?

<p>Introduction: John Sides  points  to this discussion (with over 200 comments!) by political scientist Charli Carpenter of her response to a student from another university who emailed with questions that look like they come from a homework assignment.  Here’s the student’s original  email :
  
Hi Mr. Carpenter,


I am a fourth year college student and I have the honor of reading one of your books and I just had a few questions… I am very fascinated by your work and I am just trying to understand everything. Can you please address some of my questions? I would greatly appreciate it. It certainly help me understand your wonderful article better. Thank you very much! :)


1. What is the fundamental purpose of your article?


2. What is your fundamental thesis?


3. What evidence do you use to support your thesis?


4. What is the overall conclusion?


5. Do you feel that you have a fair balance of opposing viewpoints?


Sincerely,

<p>Introduction: Following a recent email exchange regarding path sampling and thermodynamic integration (sadly, I’ve gotten rusty and haven’t thought seriously about these challenges for many years), a correspondent referred to the marginal distribution of the data under a model as “the evidence.”
 
I hate that expression!  As we discuss in chapter 6 of BDA, for continuous-parametered models, this quantity can be completely sensitive to aspects of the prior that have essentially no impact on the posterior.  In the examples I’ve seen, this marginal probability is not “evidence” in any useful sense of the term.
 
When I told this to my correspondent, he replied,
  
 I actually don’t find “the evidence” too bothersome.  I don’t have BDA at home where I’m working from at the moment, so I’ll read up on chapter 6 later, but I assume you refer to the problem of the marginal likelihood being strongly sensitive to the prior in a way that the posterior typically isn’t, thereby diminishing the value of the margi</p><p>6 0.96289897 <a title="605-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-MCMC_in_Python.html">181 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-MCMC in Python</a></p>

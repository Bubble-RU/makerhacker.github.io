What’s going to happen? There have been several studies examining correlations between adoptive and biological parents’ IQ (assuming IQ is a test analogous to the math and verbal tests, and that parent IQ is analogous to the quality of instruction – but the point is in the analysis not in the metric).

[sent-6, score-1.074]
</p><p>5 At the same time, the high IQ parents could have been raising their own child, and it would probably take the same amount of resources. [sent-8, score-0.278]
</p><p>6 There are conscientious people who might not choose to have a child because they wouldn’t be able to afford to provide to their own standard (their apartment is too small, for example, or they don’t have enough security and stability while being a graduate student). [sent-9, score-0.266]
</p><p>7 On the other hand, people with less comprehension might neglect this and impose their child on society without the means to provide for him. [sent-10, score-0.316]
</p><p>8 I am no expert, especially not in psychology, education, sociology or biology. [sent-13, score-0.058]
</p><p>9 Moreover, there is a lot more than just IQ: ethics and constructive pro-social behavior are probably more important, and might be explained a lot better by nurture than nature. [sent-14, score-0.145]
</p><p>10 I do know that I get anxious whenever a correlation analysis tries to look like a causal analysis. [sent-15, score-0.333]
</p><p>11 A frequent scenario introduces an outcome (test performance) with a highly correlated predictor (say poverty), and suggests that reducing poverty will improve the outcome. [sent-16, score-0.281]
</p><p>12 The problem is that poverty is correlated with a number of other predictors. [sent-17, score-0.231]
</p><p>13 But the real solution is a study of interventions, and the twin and adoptive studies with a longer time horizon are pretty rigorous. [sent-19, score-0.701]
</p><p>14 I’d be curious about similarly rigorous studies of educational interventions, or about the flaws in the twin and adoptive studies. [sent-20, score-0.603]
</p><p>15 [Feb 7, 8:30am] An email points out a potential flaw in the correlation analysis:     The thing which these people systematically missed, was that we don’t really care at all about the  correlation  between the adopted child’s IQ and that of the adopted parent. [sent-21, score-1.025]
</p><p>16 Example to drive home the point: Suppose the IQ of  every  adoptive parent is 120, while the IQ of the biological parents is Normal(100,15), as is that of the biological control siblings is, but that of the adopted children is Normal(110,15). [sent-23, score-1.495]
</p><p>17 The correlation between adopted children and adopted parents would be exactly zero (because the adopted parents are all so similar), but clearly adoption would have had a massive effect. [sent-24, score-1.791]
</p><p>18 And, yes, adopted parents, especially in these studies, are very different from the norm, and similar to each other: I don’t know about the Colorado study, but in the famous Minnesota twins study, the mean IQ of the adoptive fathers was indeed 120, as compared to a state average of 105. [sent-25, score-0.859]
</p><p>19 I would add that correlations are going to be especially misleading for causal inference in any situation where a variable is being regulated towards some goal level, because, if the regulation is successful. [sent-27, score-0.229]
</p><p>20 It’s like arguing that the temperature in my kitchen is causally irrelevant to the temperature in my freezer — it’s uncorrelated, but only because a lot of complicated machinery does a lot of work to keep it that way! [sent-28, score-0.274]

<p>Introduction: Ole Rogeberg points me to a discussion of a discussion of a paper:
  
Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>3 0.22634697 <a title="561-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-Flip_it_around.html">943 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-Flip it around</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  discusses  a radio interview on the effect of parents on children’s education.  In short, the interviewer (Stephen Dubner of Freakonomics fame) claims that the research shows that parents don’t have much influence on whether their children go to college.  The evidence is based on a comparison of adopted and non-adopted children.  Palko makes a convincing case that the statistical analysis (by economist Bruce Sacerdote) doesn’t show what Dubner says it shows.
 
I looked over the linked transcript, and overall I’m less unhappy than Palko is about the interview.  I agree that some of the causal implications are sloppy, and I think it’s a bit silly for the interviewer (Kai Ryssdal) to use celebrities as a benchmark.  (Ryssdal says, “if [a certain parenting style is] good enough for Steven Levitt, it’s good enough for me.”  But Levitt is a multimillionaire—he’ll always have a huge financial cushion.  It’s not clear that what works for him would work for others who are not so wel</p><p>4 0.18927163 <a title="561-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-12-%E2%80%9CTeaching_effectiveness%E2%80%9D_as_another_dimension_in_cognitive_ability.html">1620 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-12-“Teaching effectiveness” as another dimension in cognitive ability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m not a great teacher.  I can get by because I work hard and I know a lot, and for some students my classes are just great, but it’s not a natural talent of mine.  I know people who are amazing teachers, and they have something that I just don’t have.  I wrote that book, Teaching Statistics:  A Bag of Tricks (with Deb Nolan) because I’m  not  a good teacher and hence need to develop all sorts of techniques to be able to do what good teachers can do without even trying.
 
I’m not proud of being mediocre at teaching.  I don’t think that low teaching skill is some sort of indicator that I’m a great researcher.  The other think about teaching ability is that I think it’s hard to detect without actually seeing someone teach a class.  If you see me give a seminar presentation or even a guest lecture, you’d think I’m an awesome teacher.  But, actually, no.  I’m an excellent speaker, not such a great teacher.
 
This all came to mind when I received the following email from anthropologist Hen</p><p>5 0.17459713 <a title="561-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-04-Question_about_standard_range_for_social_science_correlations.html">257 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-04-Question about standard range for social science correlations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andrew Eppig writes:
  
I’m a physicist by training who is transitioning to the social sciences. I recently came across a  reference  in the Economist to a paper on IQ and parasites which I read as I have more than a passing interest in IQ research (having read much that you and others (e.g., Shalizi, Wicherts) have written). In this paper I note that the authors find a very high correlation between national IQ and parasite prevalence. The strength of the correlation (-0.76 to -0.82) surprised me, as I’m used to much weaker correlations in the social sciences. To me, it’s a bit too high, suggesting that there are other factors at play or that one of the variables is merely a proxy for a large number of other variables. But I have no basis for this other than a gut feeling and a memory of a plot on  Language Log  about the distribution of correlation coefficients in social psychology.


So my question is this: Is a correlation in the range of (-0.82,-0.76) more likely to be a correlatio</p><p>6 0.15612228 <a title="561-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-31-Into_the_thicket_of_variation%3A__More_on_the_political_orientations_of_parents_of_sons_and_daughters%2C_and_a_return_to_the_tradeoff_between_internal_and_external_validity_in_design_and_interpretation_of_research_studies.html">2193 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-31-Into the thicket of variation:  More on the political orientations of parents of sons and daughters, and a return to the tradeoff between internal and external validity in design and interpretation of research studies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Cook  and  Joseph Delaney  point to  an article  by Yurii Aulchenko et al., who write:
  
54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4-6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people. . . .


In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. . . .
  
The message is that the simple approach of predicting child’s height using a regression model given parents’ average height performs much better than the method they have based on combining 54 genes.
 
They also find that, if you start with the prediction based on parents’ heigh</p><p>3 0.7281847 <a title="561-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-22-That_claim_that_students_whose_parents_pay_for_more_of_college_get_worse_grades.html">1688 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-22-That claim that students whose parents pay for more of college get worse grades</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Theodore Vasiloudis writes:
  
I came upon  this article  by Laura Hamilton, an assistant professor in the University of California at Merced, that claims that “The more money that parents provide for higher education, the lower the grades their children earn.”


I can’t help but feel that there something wrong with the basis of the study or a confounding factor causing this apparent correlation, and since you often comment on studies on your blog I thought you might find this study interesting.
  
My reply:  I have to admit that the description above made me suspicious of the study before I even looked at it.  On first thought, I’d expect the effect of parent’s financial contributions to be positive (as they free the student from the need to get a job during college), but not negative.

Did pre-release of my [Rogeberg's] PNAS  paper  on methodological problems with Meier et al’s 2012 paper on cannabis and IQ reduce the chances that it will have its intended effect? In my case, serious methodological issues related to causal inference from non-random observational data became framed as a conflict over conclusions, forcing the original research team to respond rapidly and insufficiently to my concerns, and prompting them to defend their conclusions and original paper in a way that makes a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of their data less likely.
  
This fits with a recurring theme on this blog: the defensiveness of researchers who don’t want to admit they were wrong. Setting aside cases of outright fraud and plagiarism, I think the worst case remains that of psychologists Neil Anderson and Deniz Ones, who denied any problems even in the  presence  of a smoking gun of a graph revealing their data</p><p>5 0.72151285 <a title="561-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-31-Into_the_thicket_of_variation%3A__More_on_the_political_orientations_of_parents_of_sons_and_daughters%2C_and_a_return_to_the_tradeoff_between_internal_and_external_validity_in_design_and_interpretation_of_research_studies.html">2193 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-31-Into the thicket of variation:  More on the political orientations of parents of sons and daughters, and a return to the tradeoff between internal and external validity in design and interpretation of research studies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We recently considered a pair of studies that came out awhile ago involving children and political orientation: Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee found that, in Great Britain, parents of girls were more likely to support left-wing parties, compared to parents of boys. And, in the other direction, Dalton Conley and Emily Rauscher found with survey data from the United States that parents of girls were more likely to support the Republican party, compared to parents of boys.
 
As I  discussed  the other day, the latest version of the Conley and Raucher study came with some incoherent evolutionary theorizing.  There was also some discussion regarding the differences between the two studies.
 
Oswald sent me some relevant comments:
  
It will be hard in cross-sections like the GSS to solve the problem of endogeneity bias. Conservative families may want to have boys, and may use that as a stopping rule.  If so, they will end up with disproportionately large number of girls.

 We launched Openpaths  the other week.  It’s a site where people can privately upload and view their iPhone location data (at least until an Apple update wipes it out) and also download their data for their own use.  More than just giving people a neat tool to view their data with, however, we’re also creating an option for them to donate their data to research projects at varying levels of anonymity.  We’re still working out the terms for that, but we’d love any input and to get in touch with anyone who might want to use the data.
  
I don’t have any use for this personally but maybe it will interest some of you.

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>3 0.95891702 <a title="561-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-07-Environmentally_induced_cancer_%E2%80%9Cgrossly_underestimated%E2%80%9D%3F__Doubtful..html">21 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-07-Environmentally induced cancer “grossly underestimated”?  Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>same-blog 4 0.95668268 <a title="561-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-06-Poverty%2C_educational_performance_%E2%80%93_and_can_be_done_about_it.html">561 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-06-Poverty, educational performance – and can be done about it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Andrew has pointed to Jonathan Livengood’s  analysis  of the correlation between poverty and PISA results, whereby schools with poorer students get poorer test results. I’d have written a comment, but then I couldn’t have inserted a chart.
 
Andrew points out that a causal analysis is needed. This reminds me of an intervention that has been done before: take a child out of poverty, and bring him up in a better-off family. What’s going to happen? There have been several studies examining correlations between adoptive and biological parents’ IQ (assuming IQ is a test analogous to the math and verbal tests, and that parent IQ is analogous to the quality of instruction – but the point is in the analysis not in the metric). This is the result (from  Adoption Strategies  by Robin P Corley in Encyclopedia of Life Sciences):
 
 
 
So, while it did make a difference at an early age, with increasing age of the adopted child, the intelligence of adoptive parents might not be making any difference</p><p>5 0.95318258 <a title="561-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-02-Not_so_fast_on_levees_and_seawalls_for_NY_harbor%3F.html">1558 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-02-Not so fast on levees and seawalls for NY harbor?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was talking with  June Williamson  and mentioned offhand that I’d seen  something in the paper  saying that if only we’d invested a few billion dollars in levees we would’ve saved zillions in economic damage from the flood.  (A quick search also revealed  this  eerily prescient article from last month and, more recently,  this  online discussion.)
 
June said, No, no, no:  levees are not the way to go:
  
 Here  and  here  are the articles on “soft infrastructure” for the New York-New Jersey Harbor I was mentioning, summarizing work that is more extensively published in two books, “Rising Currents” and “On the Water: Palisade Bay”:

 
The hazards posed by climate change, sea level rise, and severe storm surges make this the time to transform our coastal cities through adaptive design.

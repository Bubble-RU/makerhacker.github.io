I mentioned this to some people awhile ago and they said that the nasty-economist thing only happens in the top departments.  I’d spoken at Columbia (which, if not at the very top, is still respectable), but that was in the political economy seminar and I’m a political scientist, so maybe they were nice to me because I’m local.  And the other econ departments where I’d spoken were in Europe (maybe they’re nicer there) or at non-elite institutions in the U.S.  So I called my friend at Harvard econ, told him my story, and asked if I could speak there.

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>5 0.12955038 <a title="1039-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-My_talk_midtown_this_Friday_noon_%28and_at_Columbia_Monday_afternoon%29.html">1821 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-My talk midtown this Friday noon (and at Columbia Monday afternoon)</a></p>

I’m also giving a shorter talk on the same topic in the Sustainable Development Seminar  Series  4pm Monday 29 Apr in room 407 International Affairs Bldg (at 118th St. and Amsterdam Ave.).

<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard all sorts of scare stories of what it’s like to speak in an academic economics seminar:  they’re rude, they interrupt constantly, they don’t let you get through three slides in an hour, etc.  But whenever I’ve actually spoke in an economics department, the people have been polite and well-behaved, really it’s been like any other seminar. 
   
I mentioned this to some people awhile ago and they said that the nasty-economist thing only happens in the top departments.  I’d spoken at Columbia (which, if not at the very top, is still respectable), but that was in the political economy seminar and I’m a political scientist, so maybe they were nice to me because I’m local.  And the other econ departments where I’d spoken were in Europe (maybe they’re nicer there) or at non-elite institutions in the U.S.  So I called my friend at Harvard econ, told him my story, and asked if I could speak there.  He duly booked me for the Harvard-MIT econometrics seminar.
 
I  spoke  at the seminar,</p><p>2 0.92840648 <a title="1039-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-03-More_on_that_Dartmouth_health_care_study.html">67 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-03-More on that Dartmouth health care study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hank Aaron at the Brookings Institution, who knows a lot more about policy than I do, had some interesting comments on the recent New York Times article about problems with the Dartmouth health care atlas. which  I discussed a few hours ago .  Aaron writes that much of the criticism in that newspaper article was off-base, but that there are real difficulties in translating the Dartmouth results (finding little relation between spending and quality of care) to cost savings in the real world.
 
Aaron writes:
     
The Dartmouth research, showing huge variation in the use of various 
medical procedures and large variations in per patient spending under 
Medicare, has been a revelation and a useful one.  There is no way to 
explain such variation on medical grounds and it is problematic.  But 
readers, including my former colleague Orszag, have taken an 
oversimplistic view of what the numbers mean and what to do about 
them.  There are three really big problems with the common

<p>Introduction: Last week I published in Slate  a critique  of a paper that appeared in the journal Psychological Science.  That paper, by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, found that women who were at peak fertility were three times more likely to wear red or pink shirts, compared to women at other points in their menstrual cycles.  The study was based an 100 participants on the internet and 24 college students.  In my critique, I argued that we had no reason to believe the results generalized to the larger population, because (1) the samples were not representative, (2) the measurements were noisy, (3) the researchers did not use the correct dates of peak fertility, and (4) there were many different comparisons that could have been reported in the data, so there was nothing special about a particular comparison being statistically significant.  I likened their paper to other work which I considered flawed for multiple comparisons (too many researcher degrees of freedom), including a claimed relation bet</p><p>4 0.9243021 <a title="1039-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-Peer_pressure%2C_selection%2C_and_educational_reform.html">326 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-Peer pressure, selection, and educational reform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Partly in response to my blog on the Harlem Children’s Zone study, Mark Palko wrote  this :
  
Talk of education reform always makes me [Palko] deeply nervous. Part of the anxiety comes having spent a number of years behind the podium and having seen the disparity between the claims and the reality of previous reforms. The rest comes from being a statistician and knowing what things like convergence can do to data.


Convergent behavior violates the assumption of independent observations used in most simple analyses, but educational studies commonly, perhaps even routinely ignore the complex ways that social norming can cause the nesting of student performance data.


In other words, educational research is often based of the idea that teenagers do not respond to peer pressure. . . .
  
and  this :
  
 
When you isolate a group of students, they will quickly arrive at a consensus of what constitutes normal behavior. It is a complex and somewhat unpredictable process driven by personali</p><p>5 0.91987002 <a title="1039-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-02-%E2%80%9CA_Christmas_Carol%E2%80%9D_as_applied_to_plagiarism.html">1440 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-02-“A Christmas Carol” as applied to plagiarism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Mashey sends me this delightful video (not in English but it has subtitles) from the University of Bergen (link comes from  this page  from Elsevier but I don’t see any direct connection between the controversial academic publisher and the Bergen group).
 
Part of me believes, deep down, that if someone were to send this link to  Edward Wegman , he will repent, that he’ll just break down, confess, and apologize to everybody involved.
 
I can’t understand the psychology of such people.  I mean, I can understand someone being lazy enough to plagiarize and to deny if accused.  But to keep denying after you’ve been caught and everyone knows you did it—I simply can’t see how someone can do that.
 
But this surely reflects my nerd-like lack of understanding of human nature, more than anything else.  It’s a bit scary that someone such as myself who has such poor intuitions about human behavior can become a prominent social scientist, but I suppose it takes all kinds.

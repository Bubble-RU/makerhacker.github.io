Earth May Have Been Hit by a Cosmic Blast 1200 Years Ago . . . this is nothing to panic about. If it happened at all, it was a long time ago, and unlikely to happen again for hundreds of thousands of years.
  
This left me confused.   If  it really did happen 1200 years ago, basic statistics would suggest it would occur approximately once every 1200 years or so (within half an order of magnitude).  So where does “hundreds of thousands of years” come from?
 
I emailed astronomer David Hogg to see if I was missing something here, and he replied:
  
Yeah, if we think this hit us 1200 years ago, we should imagine that this happens every few thousand years at least.  Now that said, if there are *other* reasons for thinking it is  exceedingly  rare, then that would be a strong a priori argument against believing in the result.  So you should either believe that it  didn’t  happen 1200 years ago, or else you should believe it  will  happen again in the next few thousan</p><p>3 0.1171422 <a title="563-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-08-Traffic_Prediction.html">752 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-08-Traffic Prediction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.10500327 <a title="563-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-28-Understanding_simulations_in_terms_of_predictive_inference%3F.html">1287 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-28-Understanding simulations in terms of predictive inference?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg writes:
  
My (now deceased) collaborator and guru in all things inference, Sam Roweis, used to emphasize to me that we should evaluate models in the data space — not the parameter space — because models are always effectively “effective” and not really, fundamentally true. Or, in other words, models should be compared in the space of their predictions, not in the space of their parameters (the  parameters didn’t really “exist” at all for Sam).  In that spirit, when we estimate the effectiveness of a MCMC method or tuning — by autocorrelation time or ESJD or anything else — shouldn’t we be looking at the changes in the model predictions over time, rather than the changes in the parameters over time?  That is, the autocorrelation time should be the autocorrelation time in what the model (at the walker position) predicts for the data, and the ESJD should be the expected squared jump distance in what the model predicts for the data?

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  blogged  on John Gottman, a psychologist whose headline-grabbing research on marriages (he got himself featured in Blink with a claim that he could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced—after meeting with them for 15 minutes!) was recently debunked in a book by Laurie Abraham.
 
The question I raised was:  how could someone who was evidently so intelligent and accomplished—Gottman, that is—get things so wrong?  My brief conclusion was that once you have some success, I guess there’s not much of a motivation to change your ways.  Also, I could well believe that, for all its flaws, Gottman’s work is better than much of the other research out there on marriages.  There’s still the question of how this stuff gets published in scientific journals. I haven’t looked at Gottman’s articles in detail and so don’t really have thoughts on that one.
 
Anyway, I recently corresponded with a mathematician who had heard of Gottman’s research and wrote</p><p>3 0.78383547 <a title="563-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-04-A_Wikipedia_whitewash.html">69 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-04-A Wikipedia whitewash</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After hearing a few times about the divorce predictions of researchers John Gottman and James Murray (work that was featured in Blink with a claim that they could predict with 83 percent accuracy whether a couple would be divorced–after meeting with them for 15 minutes) and  feeling some skepticism , I decided to do the Lord’s work and amend Gottman’s wikipedia entry, which had a paragraph saying:
  
Gottman found his methodology predicts with 90% accuracy which newlywed couples will remain married and which will divorce four to six years later. It is also 81% percent accurate in predicting which marriages will survive after seven to nine years.
  
I added the following:
  
Gottman’s claim of 81% or 90% accuracy is misleading, however, because the accuracy is measured only  after  fitting a model to his data. There is no evidence that he can predict the outcome of a marriage with high accuracy in advance.

<p>Introduction: Freakonomics  reports :
  

A reader in Norway named Christian Sørensen examined the height statistics for all players in the 2010 World Cup and found an interesting anomaly: there seemed to be unnaturally few players listed at 169, 179, and 189 centimeters and an apparent surplus of players who were 170, 180, and 190 centimeters tall (roughly 5-foot-7 inches, 5-foot-11 inches, and 6-foot-3 inches, respectively). Here’s the data:

  
 
 
It’s not costless to communicate numbers. When we compare “eighty” (6 characters) vs “seventy-nine” (12 characters) – how much information are we gaining by twice the number of characters? Do people really care about height at +-0.5 cm or is +-1 cm enough?
 
It’s harder to communicate odd numbers (“three” vs four or two, “seven” vs “six” or “eight”, “nine” vs “ten”) than even ones. As language tends to follow our behaviors, people have been doing it for a long time. We remember the shorter description of a quantity.

<p>Introduction: Alex Braunstein  writes  about Klout, a company which measures Twitter/Facebook influence:
  
As a Ph D statistician and search quality engineer, I [Braunstein] know a lot about how to properly measure things. In the past few months I’ve become an active Twitter user and very interested in measuring the influence of individuals. Klout provides a way to measure influence on Twitter using a score also called Klout. The range is 0 to 100. Light users score below 20, regular users around 30, and celebrities start around 75. Naturally, I was intrigued by the Klout measurement, but a careful analysis led to some serious issues with the score. . . .
  
Braunstein continues with some comparisons of different twitter-users and how their Klout scores don’t make much sense.

<p>Introduction: I read  this story  by Adrian Chen on Gawker (yeah, yeah, so sue me):
  
Why That ‘NASA Discovers Alien Life’ Story Is Bullshit






Fox News has a super-exciting article today: “Exclusive: NASA Scientist claims Evidence of Alien Life on Meteorite.” OMG, aliens exist! Except this NASA scientist has been claiming to have evidence of alien life on meteorites for years.
  
Chen continues with a quote from the Fox News item:
  
[NASA scientist Richard B. Hoover] gave FoxNews.com early access to the out-of-this-world research, published late Friday evening in the March edition of the Journal of Cosmology. In it, Hoover describes the latest findings in his study of an extremely rare class of meteorites, called CI1 carbonaceous chondrites — only nine such meteorites are known to exist on Earth. . . . 
  
The bad news is that Hoover reported this same sort of finding in various low-rent venues for several years.  Replication, huh?  Chen also helpfully points us to the  website  of the Journal</p><p>2 0.97932559 <a title="563-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-19-%E2%80%9CBehind_a_cancer-treatment_firm%E2%80%99s_rosy_survival_claims%E2%80%9D.html">1906 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-19-“Behind a cancer-treatment firm’s rosy survival claims”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brett Keller points to a recent  news article  by Sharon Begley and Robin Respaut:
  
A lot of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the United States decline to treat people who can’t pay, or have inadequate insurance, among other reasons. What sets CTCA [Cancer Treatment Centers of America] apart is that rejecting certain patients and, even more, culling some of its patients from its survival data lets the company tout in ads and post on its website patient outcomes that look dramatically better than they would if the company treated all comers. These are the rosy survival numbers . . .
  
Details:
  
CTCA reports on its website that the percentage of its patients who are alive after six months, a year, 18 months and longer regularly tops national figures. For instance, 60 percent of its non-small-cell lung cancer patients are alive at six months, CTCA says, compared to 38 percent nationally. And 64 percent of its prostate cancer patients are alive at three years, vers</p><p>3 0.97562873 <a title="563-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-08-Is_linear_regression_unethical_in_that_it_gives_more_weight_to_cases_that_are_far_from_the_average%3F.html">1409 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-08-Is linear regression unethical in that it gives more weight to cases that are far from the average?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following note from someone who’d like to remain anonymous: 
  
  
I read  your post  on ethics and statistics, and the comments therein, with much interest.


I did notice, however, that most of the dialogue was about ethical behavior of scientists.  Herein I’d like to suggest a different take, one that focuses on the statistical methods of scientists.


For example, fitting a line to a scatter plot of data using OLS [linear regression] gives more weight to outliers.  If each data point represents a person we are weighting people differently.  And surely the ethical implications are different if we use a least absolute deviation estimator.


Recently I reviewed a paper where the authors claimed one advantage of non-parametric rank-based tests is their robustness to outliers.  Again, maybe that outlier is the 10th person who dies from an otherwise beneficial medicine.  Should we ignore him in assessing the effect of the medicine?


I guess this gets me partly into loss f</p><p>4 0.97330284 <a title="563-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-24-Don%E2%80%99t_idealize_%E2%80%9Crisk_aversion%E2%80%9D.html">819 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-24-Don’t idealize “risk aversion”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Richard Thaler writes (click  here  and search on Thaler):
  
Both risk and risk aversion are concepts that were once well defined, but are now in danger of becoming Aetherized [this is Thaler's term for adding free parameters to a model to make it work, thus destroying the purity and much of the value of the original model]. Stocks that earn surprisingly high returns are labeled as risky, because in the theory, excess returns must be accompanied by higher risk. If, inconveniently, the traditional measures of risk such as variance or covariance with the market are not high, then the Aetherists tell us there must be some other risk; we just don’t know what it is.


Similarly, traditionally the concept of risk aversion was taken to be a primitive; each person had a parameter, gamma, that measured her degree of risk aversion. Now risk aversion is allowed to be time varying, and Aetherists can say with a straight face that the market crashes of 2001 and 2008 were caused by sudden increases</p><p>5 0.97329527 <a title="563-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-21-Busted%21.html">221 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-21-Busted!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m just glad that universities don’t  sanction  professors for publishing false theorems.
 
If the guy really is nailed by the feds for fraud, I hope they don’t throw him in prison.  In general, prison time seems like a brutal, expensive, and inefficient way to punish people.  I’d prefer if the government just took 95% of his salary for several years, made him do community service (cleaning equipment at the local sewage treatment plant, perhaps; a lab scientist should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc.  If restriction of this dude’s personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, he could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if he were ever more than 3 miles from his home.  But no need to bill the taxpayers for the cost of keeping him in prison.</p><p>6 0.96965224 <a title="563-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-15-%E2%80%9CI_coach_the_jumpers_here_at_Boise_State_._._.%E2%80%9D.html">1625 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-15-“I coach the jumpers here at Boise State . . .”</a></p>

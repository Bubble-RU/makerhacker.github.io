</p><p>5 One way to handle this problem is full Bayes:  slap a prior on sigma, do your Gibbs and Metropolis, and summarize posterior inferences by simulation. [sent-7, score-0.558]
</p><p>6 We compute a maximum penalized marginal likelihood estimate, the marginal posterior mode under a gamma ( not  inverse gamma; you know how I  hate  that) prior for the scale parameter. [sent-11, score-2.002]
</p><p>7 Our default choice is gamma (2, 1/A), where A is set to some large value such as 10 (rescaled relative to the regression predictors, as usual). [sent-12, score-0.401]
</p><p>8 The shape parameter of 2 gives a prior that is linear at 0:  thus, the posterior mode can’t be 0 under any circumstances–but it can be as close to 0 as is required based on the likelihood. [sent-13, score-0.969]
</p><p>9 Some basic algebra shows that if the marginal maximum likelihood estimate is at 0, our posterior mode estimate will be about 1 standard error away from 0, which seems about right. [sent-14, score-1.519]
</p><p>10 The rate parameter, 1/A, is set to be small so that the prior will only pull the estimate down if it is unexpectedly large, as might occur if the number of groups is small. [sent-15, score-0.639]
</p><p>11 Our prior distribution is weakly informative in that it does something to the estimate but is generic and doesn’t have much information as we would have in just about any particular example. [sent-16, score-0.822]
</p><p>12 I think that in many applied examples it would make sense to use stronger prior information. [sent-17, score-0.384]
</p><p>13 But I think that, as a default choice, the weakly informative gamma (2, 1/A) prior makes more sense than the uniform distribution (corresponding to the nonregularized estimate). [sent-18, score-0.962]
</p><p>14 In the multivariate case, we use a Wishart ( not  inverse-Wishart), which when we choose the right parameters keeps the variances away from 0 and the correlation matrix positive definite. [sent-19, score-0.633]
</p><p>15 One interesting feature of these models is that the weakly-informative regularizing prior we use for a point estimate is  not  the same as the weakly-informative prior that we would use for full Bayes (where there is no need to keep the posterior mode away from the boundary).

</p><p>18 By choosing the prior from the gamma family with at least 1 degree of freedom, we ensure that the prior density is zero at the boundary and thus the marginal posterior mode of the group-level variance will be positive. [sent-23, score-2.001]
</p><p>19 The use of a weakly informative prior allows us to stabilize our estimates while remaining faithful to the data. [sent-24, score-0.94]

<p>Introduction: A student writes:
  
I have a question about an earlier recommendation of yours on the election of the prior distribution for the precision hyperparameter of a normal distribution, and a reference for the recommendation. If I recall correctly I have read that you have suggested to use Gamma(1.4, 0.4) instead of Gamma(0.01,0.01) for the prior distribution of the precision hyper parameter of a normal distribution.


I would very much appreciate if you would have the time to point me to this publication of yours. The reason is that I have used the prior distribution (Gamma(1.4, 0.4)) in a study which we now revise for publication, and where a reviewer question the choice of the distribution (claiming that it is too informative!).


I am well aware of that you in recent publications (Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models.

While I am absolutely sympathetic to the Bayesian agenda I am often troubled by the requirement of having priors. We must have priors on the parameter of an infinite number of model we have never seen before and I find this troubling. There is a similarly troubling problem in economics of utility theory. Utility is on consumables. To be complete a consumer must assign utility to all sorts of things they never would have encountered. More recent versions of utility theory instead make consumption goods a portfolio of attributes. Cadillacs are x many units of luxury y of transport etc etc. And we can automatically have personal utilities to all these attributes.  


I don’t ever see parameters. Some model have few and some have hundreds. Instead, I see data. So I don’t know how to have an opinion on parameters themselves. Rather I think it far more natural to have opinions on the behavior of models. The prior predictive density is a good and sensible notion.

<p>Introduction: Jouni Kerman did a cool bit of research justifying the Beta (1/3, 1/3) prior as noninformative for binomial data, and the Gamma (1/3, 0) prior for Poisson data.
 
You probably thought that nothing new could be said about noninformative priors in such basic problems, but you were wrong!
 
Here’s  the story :
  
The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events. As alternative default conjugate priors, I [Jouni] introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and Gamma(1/3, 0), which I cal</p><p>5 0.85568142 <a title="779-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-15-Reputations_changeable%2C_situations_tolerable.html">1858 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-15-Reputations changeable, situations tolerable</a></p>

Marginally specified priors for nonparametric Bayesian estimation


Prior specification for nonparametric Bayesian inference involves the difficult task of quantifying prior knowledge about a parameter of high, often infinite, dimension. Realistically, a statistician is unlikely to have informed opinions about all aspects of such a parameter, but may have real information about functionals of the parameter, such the population mean or variance. This article proposes a new framework for nonparametric Bayes inference in which the prior distribution for a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter is decomposed into two parts: an informative prior on a finite set of functionals, and a nonparametric conditional prior for the parameter given the functionals. Such priors can be easily constructed from standard nonparametric prior distributions in common use, and inherit the large support of the standard priors upon which they are based.

<p>Introduction: For awhile I’ve been fitting most of my multilevel models using lmer/glmer, which gives point estimates of the group-level variance parameters (maximum marginal likelihood estimate for lmer and an approximation for glmer).  I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.  Typically, when this happens, it’s not that we’re so sure the variance is close to zero or that the correlation is close to 1 or -1; rather, the marginal likelihood does not provide a lot of information about these parameters of the group-level error distribution.
 
I don’t want point estimates on the boundary.  I don’t want to say that the unexplained variance in some dimension is exactly zero.
 
One way to handle this problem is full Bayes:  slap a prior on sigma, do your Gibbs and Metropolis</p><p>2 0.93804383 <a title="779-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-09-Default_priors_update%3F.html">846 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-09-Default priors update?</a></p>

I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.

<p>Introduction: We were talking about parallelizing MCMC and I came up with what I thought was a neat idea for parallelizing MCMC (sample with fractional prior, average samples on a per-draw basis).  But then I realized this approach could get the right posterior mean or right posterior variance, but not both, depending on how the prior was divided (for a beta-binomial example).  Then  Aki  told me it had already been done in a more general form in a paper of Scott et al.,  Bayes and Big Data , which was then used as the baseline in: 
 
Willie Neiswanger, Chong Wang, and Eric Xing. 2013.   Asymptotically Exact, Embarrassingly Parallel MCMC .  arXiv  1311.4780. 
 
It’s a neat paper, which Xi’an  already blogged  about months ago.  But what really struck me was the following quote:
  

We use Stan, an automated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) software package, to perform sampling for both the true posterior (for groundtruth and comparison methods) and for the subposteriors on each machine.

<p>Introduction: Tim Hanson sends along  this paper  (coauthored with Adam Branscum and Wesley Johnson):
  
Eliciting information from experts for use in constructing prior distributions for logistic regression coefficients can be challenging. The task is especially difficult when the model contains many predictor variables, because the expert is asked to provide summary information about the probability of “success” for many subgroups of the population. Often, however, experts are confident only in their assessment of the population as a whole. This paper is about incorporating such overall, marginal or averaged, information easily into a logistic regression data analysis by using g-priors. We present a version of the g-prior such that the prior distribution on the probability of success can be set to closely match a beta dis- tribution, when averaged over the set of predictors in a logistic regression.

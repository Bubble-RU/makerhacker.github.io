<p>Introduction: John Sides  followed up  on a discussion of his  earlier claim  that political independents vote for president in a reasonable way based on economic performance.  John’s original post led to the amazing claim by New Republic writer Jonathan Chait that John wouldn’t “even want to be friends with anybody who” voted in this manner.
 
I’ve been sensitive to discussions of rationality and voting ever since Aaron Edlin, Noah Kaplan, and I wrote  our article  on voting as a rational choice:  why and how people vote to improve the well-being of others.
 
Models of rationality are controversial In politics, just as they are in other fields ranging from economics to criminology.  On one side you have people trying to argue that all behavior is rational, from lottery playing to drug addiction to engaging in email with exiled Nigerian royalty.  Probably the only behavior that nobody has yet to claim is rational is blogging, but I bet that’s coming too.

<p>Introduction: Blogger Echidne pointed me to a recent  article , “The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality,” by Marco Del Giudice, Tom Booth, and Paul Irwing, who find:
  
Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. . . . We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES [effect size], the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).
  
Echidne  quotes  a  news article  in which one of the study’s authors going overboard:

<p>Introduction: Nowadays “Bayesian” is often taken to be a synonym for rationality, and I can see how this can irritate thoughtful philosophers and statisticians alike: To start with, lots of rational thinking—even lots of rational statistical inference—does not occur within the Bayesian formalism. And, to look at it from the other direction, lots of self-proclaimed Bayesian inference hardly seems rational at all.  And in what way is “subjective probability” a model for rational scientific inquiry? On the contrary, subjectivity and rationality are in many ways opposites!  [emphasis added]


The goal of this paper is to break the link between Bayesian modeling (good, in my opinion) and subjectivity (bad). From this perspective, the irritation of falsificationists regarding exaggerated claims of Bayesian rationality are my ally. . . .

<p>Introduction: According to a  New York Times article , cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have a new theory about rational argument: humans didn’t develop it in order to learn about the world, we developed it in order to win arguments with other people. “It was a purely social phenomenon. It evolved to help us convince others and to be careful when others try to convince us.” 
 
Based on the NYT article, it seems that Mercier and Sperber are basically flipping around the traditional argument, which is that humans learned to reason about the world, albeit imperfectly, and learned to use language to convey that reasoning to others.  These guys would suggest that it’s the other way around: we learned to argue with others, and this has gradually led to the ability to actually make (and recognize) sound arguments, but only indirectly.  The article says “”At least in some cultural contexts, this results in a kind of arms race towards greater sophistication in the production and evaluation o</p><p>4 0.65486306 <a title="1052-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-02-Rational_addiction.html">444 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-02-Rational addiction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>6 0.62136853 <a title="1052-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-03-%E2%80%9CRationality%E2%80%9D_reinforces%2C_does_not_compete_with%2C_other_models_of_behavior.html">692 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-03-“Rationality” reinforces, does not compete with, other models of behavior</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Kent Osband, author of “Pandora’s Risk: Uncertainty at the Core of Finance,” sent along  this paper :
  
Fluids are turbulent when tiny differences in space or time make for gross differences in behavior. The mathematical signature of turbulence is an endless moment or cumulant hierarchy. Bayesian tracking of continuous-time processes turns out to have a similar mathematical structure. As a result, tiny doubts about regime change or tiny errors in estimation or calculation are prone under stress to balloon into gross differences of opinion. In effect, reasonable people are bound to disagree. This finding has profound implications for our understanding of financial markets and other instruments of social learning. In particular it explains forecast degradation, frequent trading, excess volatility, and GARCH behavior without imputing widespread irrationality. Rational learning makes markets turbulent.

<p>Introduction: The National Climatic Data Center has  tentatively announced  that 2010 is, get this, “tied” for warmest on record.  Presumably they mean it’s tied to the precision that they quote (1.12 F above the 20th-century average). The uncertainty in the measurements, as well as some fuzziness about exactly what is being measured (how much of the atmosphere, and the oceans) makes these global-average things really suspect.  For instance, if there’s more oceanic turnover one year, that can warm the deep ocean but cool the shallow ocean and atmosphere, so even though the heat content of the atmosphere-ocean system goes up, some of these “global-average” estimates can go down. The reverse can happen too.  And of course there are various sources of natural variability that are not, these days, what most people are most interested in.  So everybody who knows about the climate professes to hate the emphasis on climate records.  And yet, they’re irresistible.  I’m sure we’ll see the usual clamor of som</p><p>4 0.93990123 <a title="1052-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-07-Hangman_tips.html">1250 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-07-Hangman tips</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff pointed me to  this  article by Nick Berry.  It’s kind of fun but of course if you know your opponent will be following this strategy you can figure out how to outwit it.  Also, Berry writes that ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ is the “ordering of letter frequency in English language.”  Indeed this is the conventional ordering but nobody thinks it’s right anymore.  See  here  (with further discussion  here ).  I wonder what corpus he’s using.

<p>Introduction: As I  wrote  a couple years ago:
  
Even though statistical analysis has demonstrated that presidential elections are predictable given economic conditions and previous votes in the states . . . it certainly doesn’t mean that every election can be accurately predicted ahead of time.  Presidential general election campaigns have several distinct features that distinguish them from most other elections:


1.  Two major candidates; 
2.  The candidates clearly differ in their political ideologies and in their positions on economic issues; 
3.  The two sides have roughly equal financial and organizational resources; 
4.  The current election is the latest in a long series of similar contests (every four years); 
5.  A long campaign, giving candidates a long time to present their case and giving voters a long time to make up their minds.


Other elections look different. . . .
  
Or, as I  said  in reference to the current NYC mayoral election:

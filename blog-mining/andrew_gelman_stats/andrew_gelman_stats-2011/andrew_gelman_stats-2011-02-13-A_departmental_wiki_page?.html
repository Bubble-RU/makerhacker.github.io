Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .

<p>Introduction: Back when I taught at Berkeley, I once asked a Ph.D. student how he’d decided to work with me.  He said that a couple of the tenured professors had advised him not to take my class, and that this advice had got him curious:  What about  Bayesian statistics is so dangerous that it can scare these otherwise unflappable stat professors.  Overall, my senior colleagues’ advice to students to avoid my course probably decreased my enrollment, but the students who  did  decide to attend surely had better character than the ones who followed directions.  (Or, at least I’d like to think that.)
 
I was reminded of that incident recently when reading a  news article  by Marc Tracy:
  
A U.S. Department of Education committee is investigating whether a Columbia University department head “steered” a Jewish student away from taking a class on the Mideast taught by Professor Joseph Massad due to the perception that she would be “uncomfortable” because of the professor’s pro-Palestinian tilt . . . “Ba</p><p>4 0.1672422 <a title="571-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Applied_Statistics_Center_miniconference%3A__Statistical_sampling_in_developing_countries.html">359 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Applied Statistics Center miniconference:  Statistical sampling in developing countries</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Steve Porter writes with a question about matching for inferences in a hierarchical data structure.  I’ve never thought about this particular issue, but it seems potentially important.
 
Maybe one or more of you have some useful suggestions?
 
Porter writes:
  
 
After immersing myself in the relatively sparse literature on propensity scores with clustered data, it seems as if people take one of two approaches. If the treatment is at the cluster-level (like school policies), they match on only the cluster-level covariates. If the treatment is at the individual level, they match on individual-level covariates. (I have also found some papers that match on individual-level covariates when it seems as if the treatment is really at the cluster-level.) But what if there is a selection process at both levels?

<p>Introduction: American University in Washington, D.C. has  two full-time tenure-line positions available :
  
An ideal candidate will have facility with computation, and can identify specific prospects for on-campus collaboration, possibly interdepartmental. We are particularly interested in candidates who can assist colleagues who need to deal with data sets that are too large, distributed, or heterogeneous to be amenable to traditional methods of analysis. From a mathematician, we also seek a research program with deep roots in mathematics.  From a statistician, we seek a familiarity with Bayesian modeling. We are open to researchers who ignore traditional disciplinary boundaries.
  
I like the bits about computation, interdepartmental, and Bayesian modeling.  My former colleagues at Berkeley would be spinning in their theorems were they to see this (but, don’t worry, I doubt they read blogs).  I really do think that computation is more important than theorem-proving.  Both are important (for exam</p><p>4 0.72430772 <a title="571-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-Classic_probability_mistake%2C_this_time_in_the_%28virtual%29_pages_of_the_New_York_Times.html">386 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-Classic probability mistake, this time in the (virtual) pages of the New York Times</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xian pointed me to  this recycling  of a classic probability error.  It’s too bad it was in the New York Times, but at least it was in the Opinion Pages, so I guess that’s not so bad.  And, on the plus side, several of the blog commenters got the point.
 
What I was wondering, though, was who was this “Yitzhak Melechson, a statistics professor at the University of Tel Aviv”?  This is such a standard problem, I’m surprised to find a statistics professor making this mistake.  I was curious what his area of research is and where he was trained.
 
I started by googling Yitzhak Melechson but all I could find was this news story, over and over and over and over again.  Then I found Tel Aviv University and navigated to its statistics department but couldn’t find any Melechson in the faculty list.  Next stop:  entering Melechson in the search engine at the Tel Aviv University website.  It came up blank.
 
One last try:  I entered the Yitzhak Melechson into Google Scholar.

<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?
 
In the meantime, if anybody feels like setting up a wikipedia entry for the research of Columbia’s statistics faculty, that</p><p>2 0.95760798 <a title="571-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-22-Postdoc_at_Rennes_on_multilevel_missing_data_imputation.html">2260 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-22-Postdoc at Rennes on multilevel missing data imputation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Julie Josse sends along this job announcement:
  
A post-doctoral position is available in the applied mathematics department of Agrocampus Rennes. The postdoc will be funded by the Henri Lebesgue Center (see http://www.lebesgue.fr/) if the application is selected. Applicants are expected to send their application before 31 March 2014.


The research focus is on development of new methods to deal with missing values and their implementation in the free R software to make them available. We study new multiple imputation methods based on principal component methods. 
   
Different aspects are expected to be covered: dealing with missing values in multi-blocks, multi-groups data (groups of individuals and variables); regularization in this framework using a Bayesian approach, dealing with different types of data (continuous, categoricals, etc.). Fields of application are wide and include biological data as well as socio-economic data.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  article  where Ron Unz provides evidence that Jews are way overrepresented at Ivy League colleges, with Asians-Americans and non-Jewish whites correspondingly underrepresented.  Unz attributes this to bias and pressure in the admissions office and recommends that, instead, top colleges should switch to a system based purely academic credentials (he never clearly defines these, but I assume he’s talking about high school grades, SAT scores, and prizes in recognized academic competitions).  He recommends that Harvard, for example, get rid of preferences for athletes, musicians, and rich people, and instead reserve one-fifth of their slots based on pure academic merit and with the remaining four-fifth “being randomly selected from the 30,000 or so American applicants considered able to reasonably perform at the school’s required academic level and thereby benefit from a Harvard education.”

<p>Introduction: One of the new examples for the third edition of Bayesian Data Analysis is a spell-checking story.   Here it is  (just start at 2/3 down on the first page, with “Spelling correction”).
 
I like this example—it demonstrates the Bayesian algebra, also gives a sense of the way that probability models (both “likelihood” and “prior”) are constructed from existing assumptions and data.  The models aren’t just specified as a mathematical exercise, they represent some statement about reality.  And the problem is close enough to our experience that we can consider ways in which the model can be criticized and improved, all in a simple example that has only three possibilities.</p><p>5 0.94797593 <a title="571-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-16-Another_day%2C_another_plagiarist.html">1266 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-16-Another day, another plagiarist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This one isn’t actually new, but it’s new to me.  It involves University of Michigan business school professor Karl Weick.  Here’s the relevant paragraph of Weick’s  Wikipedia  entry (as of 13 Apr 2012):
  
In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by Miroslav Holub that was published in the Times Literary Supplement. Weick plagiarized Holub in that he republished the poem (with some minor differences, including removing line breaks and making small changes in a few words) without quotation or attribution. Some of Weick’s articles included the material with no reference to Holub; others referred to Holub but without indicating that Weick had essentially done a direct copy of Holub’s writing. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham. [5]  In a response, Weick disputed the claim of plagiarism, writing, “By the time I began to see the Alps story as an example of cognition in the path of the action, I had lo</p><p>6 0.94663751 <a title="571-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-12-Probability_of_successive_wins_in_baseball.html">29 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-12-Probability of successive wins in baseball</a></p>

</p><p>4 The spline model for the response given stratum size seems like a good way to go. [sent-16, score-0.308]
</p><p>5 My only comment here is that I have always associated pps sampling with two-stage cluster sampling, in which clusters are sampled pps and then a fixed-size sample is drawn from each cluster. [sent-17, score-0.861]
</p><p>6 In this case, the classical pps unit weights are all equal, and it is hard for me to believe that a model-based approach can improve much upon this, at least in settings in which the measures of size used in the sampling are not far from the actual sizes of the clusters. [sent-18, score-1.024]
</p><p>7 As Little emphasizes, weights and other survey adjustment procedures are intended to correct for known differences between sample and population. [sent-19, score-0.974]
</p><p>8 I would rephrase his claim that “model- based statisticians cannot avoid weights,” and instead say that statisticians cannot avoid adjustment, but this adjustment could take other forms, such as my personal favorite of model- based poststratification (Gelman and T. [sent-20, score-0.75]
</p><p>9 Don Rubin once told me he would prefer to do all survey adjustment using multiple imputation; for example, in a survey of 1000 American adults, he would impute the missing responses for the other 250 million. [sent-23, score-0.844]
</p><p>10 I asked him if that was impractical, and he replied that the imputation could only realistically be performed conditional on information available on all 250 million; i. [sent-24, score-0.277]
</p><p>11 Census demographics, and thus the imputation would in fact be equivalent to fitting a regression model of the response conditional on key demographic variables recorded in the survey and then summing over Census numbers to get national estimates. [sent-26, score-0.765]
</p><p>12 Depending on the method used to estimate the regression, it might be possible to approximate such an estimate as a weighted average over the sample (Little, 1993, Gelman, 2006) but it would be stretching it to call this a use of weights. [sent-27, score-0.545]
</p><p>13 In addition, under this approach, the approximate weights depend on the fitted model and thus on the outcome being modeled. [sent-28, score-0.585]
</p><p>14 Having a different weight for each question on the survey would seem to go beyond the usual conception of survey weighting. [sent-29, score-0.594]
</p><p>15 Even in the design-based world, survey weights are not always based on selection probabilities. [sent-30, score-0.901]
</p><p>16 Consider the following poststratification example: A national survey of American adults is conducted and yields 600 female respondents and 400 males. [sent-31, score-0.511]

</p><p>18 48 times the average for the men, which corresponds to unit weights of 0. [sent-34, score-0.595]
</p><p>19 These are not inverse selection probabilities but rather are based on the known proportions of men and women in the sample and population. [sent-39, score-0.684]
</p><p>20 The weights are not even estimated inverse selection probabilities, a fact which we can see by noting that, even the actual selection probabilities were given to us, we would not use them: the poststratification weights are better. [sent-40, score-1.559]

<p>Introduction: From a comment I made in an email exchange:
 
My  work  on survey adjustments has very much been inspired by the ideas of Rod Little.  Much of my efforts have gone toward the goal of integrating hierarchical modeling (which is so helpful for small-area estimation) with post stratification (which adjusts for known differences between sample and population).  In the surveys I’ve dealt with, nonresponse/nonavailability can be a big issue, and I’ve always tried to emphasize that (a) the probability of a person being included in the sample is just about never known, and (b) even if this probability were known, I’d rather know the empirical n/N than the probability p (which is only valid in expectation).  Regarding nonparametric modeling:  I haven’t done much of that (although I hope to at some point) but Rod and his students have.
 
As I wrote in the first sentence of the above-linked paper, I do think the current theory and practice of survey weighting is a mess, in that much depends on so</p><p>3 0.27064326 <a title="784-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-28-Bayesian_nonparametric_weighted_sampling_inference.html">2351 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-28-Bayesian nonparametric weighted sampling inference</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yajuan Si, Natesh Pillai, and I  write :
  
It has historically been a challenge to perform Bayesian inference in a design-based survey context. The present paper develops a Bayesian model for sampling inference using inverse-probability weights. We use a hierarchical approach in which we model the distribution of the weights of the nonsampled units in the population and simultaneously include them as predictors in a nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We use simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our procedure and compare it to the classical design-based estimator. We apply our method to the Fragile Family Child Wellbeing Study. Our studies find the Bayesian nonparametric finite population estimator to be more robust than the classical design-based estimator without loss in efficiency.

<p>Introduction: Suguru Mizunoya writes:
  
When we estimate the number of people from a national sampling survey (such as labor force survey) using sampling weights, don’t we obtain underestimated number of people, if the country’s population is growing and the sampling frame is based on an old census data?  In countries with increasing populations, the probability of inclusion changes over time, but the weights can’t be adjusted frequently because census takes place only once every five or ten years.


I am currently working for UNICEF for a project on estimating number of out-of-school children in developing countries. The project leader is comfortable to use estimates of number of people from DHS and other surveys.  But, I am concerned that we may need to adjust the estimated number of people by the population projection, otherwise the estimates will be underestimated.


I googled around on this issue, but I could not find a right article or paper on this.

<p>Introduction: This is it, the last question on the exam!
 
28. A telephone survey was conducted several years ago, asking people how often they were polled in the past year. I can’t recall the responses, but suppose that 40% of the respondents said they participated in zero surveys in the previous year, 30% said they participated in one survey, 15% said two surveys, 10% said three, and 5% said four. From this it is easy to estimate an average, but there is a worry that this survey will itself overrepresent survey participants and thus overestimate the rate at which the average person is surveyed. Come up with a procedure to use these data to get an improved estimate of the average number of surveys that a randomly-sampled American is polled in a year.
 
 Solution to question 27

<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites

“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago Rod Little was invited to write an article for the diamond jubilee of the Calcutta Statistical Association Bulletin.  His article was published with discussions from Danny Pfefferman, J. N. K. Rao, Don Rubin, and myself. 
 Here it all is .
 
I’ll paste my discussion below, but it’s worth reading the others’ perspectives too.  Especially the part in Rod’s rejoinder where he points out a mistake I made.
  

 
Survey weights, like sausage and legislation, are designed and best appreciated by those who are placed a respectable distance from their manufacture. For those of us working inside the factory, vigorous discussion of methods is appreciated. I enjoyed Rod Little’s review of the connections between modeling and survey weighting and have just a few comments.
 
I like Little’s discussion of model-based shrinkage of post-stratum averages, which, as he notes, can be seen to correspond to shrinkage of weights. I would only add one thing to his formula at the end of his</p><p>3 0.95798129 <a title="784-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-08-Poli_sci_plagiarism_update%2C_and_a_note_about_the_benefits_of_not_caring.html">400 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-08-Poli sci plagiarism update, and a note about the benefits of not caring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent story about academic plagiarism spurred me to some more general thoughts about the intellectual benefits of not giving a damn.
 
I’ll briefly summarize the plagiarism story and then get to my larger point.
 
 Copying big blocks of text from others’ writings without attribution 
 
Last month I  linked  to the story of Frank Fischer, an elderly professor of political science who was caught copying big blocks of text (with minor modifications) from others’ writings without attribution.
  

 
Apparently there’s some dispute about whether this constitutes plagiarism.  On one hand,  Harvard’s policy  is that “in academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source in your paper.”  On the other hand, several of Fischer’s colleagues  defend him  by saying, “Mr. Fischer sometimes used the words of other authors. . . ”  They also write:
  
The essence of plagiarism is passing off someone else’s work as</p><p>4 0.95763218 <a title="784-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-12-Get_the_Data.html">569 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-12-Get the Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  GetTheData , you can ask and answer data related questions. Here’s a preview:   
 
I’m not sure a Q&A; site is the best way to do this. 
 
My pipe dream is to create a taxonomy of variables and instances, and collect spreadsheets annotated this way. Imagine doing a search of type: “give me datasets, where an instance is a person, the variables are age, gender and weight” – and out would come datasets, each one tagged with the descriptions of the variables that were held constant for the whole dataset (person_type=student, location=Columbia, time_of_study=1/1/2009, study_type=longitudinal). It would even be possible to automatically convert one variable into another, if it was necessary (like age = time_of_measurement-time_of_birth). Maybe the dream of  Semantic Web  will actually be implemented for relatively structured statistical data rather than much fuzzier “knowledge”, just consider the difficulties of developing a universal  Freebase .  Wolfram|Alpha  is perhaps currently clos</p><p>5 0.95619547 <a title="784-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-04-Bayesian_Page_Rank%3F.html">1098 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-04-Bayesian Page Rank?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Loren Maxwell writes: 
  
  
I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.

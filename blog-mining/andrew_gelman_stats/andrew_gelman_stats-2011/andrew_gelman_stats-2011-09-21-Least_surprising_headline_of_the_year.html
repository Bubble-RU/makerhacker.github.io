I [Rogers] am a member of an online community of statisticians where I burn a great deal of time (and a recovering cog sci researcher). Our community website is a peer-reviewed Q and A spanning stats topics ranging from applications to mathematical theory. Our online community consists of mostly university faculty, grad students and technical consultants. The answer quality is very strong and the web design is intuitive. I think you and your readers are like-minded and would be really interested in some of the topics on the site,  CrossValidated  (you may know the sister site:  stackoverflow.com ). The philosophy is purely to further knowledge for the sake of knowledge and take pride in learning.
  
I took a quick look and the site seemed like it could be useful to people.  The only thing I didn’t understand is, why doesn’t it have a search function?  (Or maybe it was there somewhere and I couldn’t find it.)

<p>Introduction: I received the following email, subject line “Want to Buy Text Link from andrewgelman.com”: 
  
  
Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got. Also kindly note that I can buy 1 to 50 links from one site – so you should understand the scale of the project. If you have multiple sites with co</p><p>5 0.10552451 <a title="919-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-24-An_open_site_for_researchers_to_post_and_share_papers.html">2304 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-24-An open site for researchers to post and share papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexander Grossman  writes :
  
We have launched a beta version of ScienceOpen in December at the occasion of the MRS Fall meeting in Boston. The participants of that conference, most of them were active researchers in physics, chemistry, and materials science, provided us with a very positive feedback. In particular they emphazised that it appears to be a good idea to offer scientists a free platform to collaborate with each other and to share draft versions of their next paper privately.


Meanwhile more than 1 million open access papers in the area of the natural sciences and medicine can be accessed via ScienceOpen, read, and commented or evaluated after publication. We call this concept post-publication peer review.
  
I don’t know anything about this but I thought I’d share it with you.  I know a lot of people use Arxiv but that has some problems, maybe this will have some advantages.

<p>Introduction: I love a good GUI but not if it doesn’t give me the information I need.  I  again  tried Hipmunk and it  again  failed (this time for a trip to Baltimore where it gave only a useless subset of the available Amtrak trains).
 
   
 
I don’t know anything about the internet biz.  What I’m guessing is that they set up this cool website that is pretty much functional, with the goal of selling it for a few million dollars to Travelocity or Expedia or Kayak.  What I’m wondering is, why haven’t they made the deal already?  Hipmunk’s GUI is great.  The site is useless because it’s missing so many flights, but if you put it in an actual travel site such as Expedia, it would be great.
 
It’s enough to make me want to hit someone with an i-phone . . .</p><p>3 0.6406253 <a title="919-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-30-The_spam_just_gets_weirder_and_weirder.html">1698 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-30-The spam just gets weirder and weirder</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the inbox today, under the header, “Hidden Costs behind Milk & Dairy Consumption (video)”:
  
Hey Professor Gelman,


Our site’s production team recently released a short video uncovering the local and global impact that milk has on our lives.


After spending some time on your posts, I noticed you talked about dairy products and milk so I thought I’d email you. Are you the correct person to contact in regards to the content on the site? 


If so, let me know if you’re interested in checking out the video.


Thanks, 
Emily S.
  
Hmmm . . . I guess I do talk a lot about dairy products and milk on this site!</p><p>4 0.63614106 <a title="919-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk_update.html">497 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Hipmunk update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Florence from customer support at  Hipmunk  writes:
  
Hipmunk now includes American Airlines in our search results. Please note that users will be taken directly to AA.com to complete the booking/transaction. . . . we are steadily increasing the number of flights that we offer on Hipmunk.
  
As you may recall, Hipmunk is a  really cool flight-finder that didn’t actually work  (as of 16 Sept 2010).  At the time, I was a bit annoyed at the NYT columnist who plugged Hipmunk without actually telling his readers that the site didn’t actually do the job.  (I discovered the problem myself because I couldn’t believe that my flight options to Raleigh-Durham were really so meager, so I checked on Expedia and found a good flight.)
 
I do think Hipmunk’s graphics are beautiful, though, so I’m rooting for them to catch up.
 
P.S.  Apparently they include Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains, so I’ll give them a try, next time I travel.  The regular Amtrak website is about as horrible as you’d expect.</p><p>5 0.62772638 <a title="919-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-10-The_birthday_problem.html">1976 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-10-The birthday problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  posts  the following note from a taxi driver:
  
I learned very early on to never drive someone to their destination if it was a route they drove themselves, say to their home from the airport . . . Everyone prides themselves on driving the shortest route but they rarely do. . . . When I first started driving a cab, I drove the shortest route—always, I’m ethical—but people would accuse me of taking the long way because it wasn’t the way they drove . . . In the end, experts they consider themselves to be, people are a tangle of unexamined emotional impulses and illogical responses.
  
I take a lot of rides to and from the airport, and I can assure you that a lot of taxi drivers don’t know the good routes.  Once I had to start screaming from the back seat to stop the guy from getting on the BQE.  I don’t “pride myself” on knowing a good route home from the airport, but I prefer the good route.
 
I’m guessing that the taxi driver quoted above is subject to the same illusions</p><p>3 0.70141864 <a title="919-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-30-Memorial_Day_question.html">737 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-30-Memorial Day question</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a kid they shifted a bunch of holidays to Monday.  (Not all the holidays:  they kept New Year’s, Christmas, and July 4th on fixed dates, they kept Thanksgiving on a Thursday, and for some reason the shifted Veterans Day didn’t stick.  But they successfully moved Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day.
 
It makes sense to give people a 3-day weekend.  I have no idea why they picked Monday rather than Friday, but either one would do, I suppose.
 
My question is:  if this Monday holiday thing was such a good idea, why did it take them so long to do it?</p><p>4 0.62296069 <a title="919-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-07-Mister_P_makes_the_big_jump_from_the_New_York_Times_to_the_Washington_Post.html">190 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-07-Mister P makes the big jump from the New York Times to the Washington Post</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I Paid a Bribe  by Janaagraha, a Bangalore based not-for-profit, harnesses the collective energy of citizens and asks them to report on the nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of corruption activities. These reports would be used to argue for improving governance systems and procedures, tightening law enforcement and regulation and thereby reduce the scope for corruption.
 
Here’s a presentation of data from the application: 
   
 
 
 Transparency International  could make something like this much more widely available around the  world .
 
While awareness is good, follow-up is even better. For example, it’s known that New York’s subway signal inspections  were being falsified . Signal inspections are pretty serious stuff, as failures lead to  disasters , such as the one in Washington. Nothing much happened after: the person responsible (making $163k a year) was merely  reassigned .</p><p>6 0.61140329 <a title="919-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-02-At_least_he_didn%E2%80%99t_prove_a_false_theorem.html">741 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-02-At least he didn’t prove a false theorem</a></p>

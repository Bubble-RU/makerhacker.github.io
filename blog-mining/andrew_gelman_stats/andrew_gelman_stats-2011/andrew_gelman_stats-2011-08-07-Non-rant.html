<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu has posted a series of reflections  here ,  here , and  here  on the dominance of graduates of HYPS (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford (in that order, I believe)) in various Master-of-the-Universe-type jobs at “elite law firms, consultancies, and I-banks, hedge/venture funds, startups, and technology companies.”  Hsu writes:
  
In the real world, people believe in folk notions of brainpower or IQ. (“Quick on the uptake”, “Picks things up really fast”, “A sponge” …) They count on elite educational institutions to do their g-filtering for them. . . .


Most top firms only recruit at a few schools. A kid from a non-elite UG school has very little chance of finding a job at one of these places unless they first go to grad school at, e.g., HBS, HLS, or get a PhD from a top place. (By top place I don’t mean “gee US News says Ohio State’s Aero E program is top 5!” — I mean, e.g., a math PhD from Berkeley or a PhD in computer science from MIT — the traditional top dogs in academ</p><p>4 0.10427645 <a title="843-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-27-Neumann_update.html">432 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-27-Neumann update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice. The breadth of vN’s work is just too m</p><p>5 0.10318221 <a title="843-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-15-Wacky_priors_can_work_well%3F.html">1723 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-15-Wacky priors can work well?</a></p>

I would love to see a blog entry on  this article , Bayesian Model Selection in High-Dimensional Settings, by Valen Johnson and David Rossell.  The simulation results are very encouraging although the choice of colors for some of the graphics is unfortunate.  Unless I am colorblind in some way that I am unaware of, they have two thin charcoal lines that are indistinguishable.
  
When Dave Judkins puts in a request, I’ll respond.  Also, I’m always happy to see a new Val Johnson paper.  Val and I are contemporaries—he and I got our PhD’s at around the same time, with both of us working on Bayesian image reconstruction, then in the early 1990s Val was part of the legendary group at Duke’s Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences—a veritable ’27 Yankees featuring Mike West, Merlise Clyde, Michael Lavine, Dave Higdon, Peter Mueller, Val, and a bunch of others.

<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.

<p>Introduction: After seeing  this graph :
 
   
 
I have the following message for Sharad:
 
Rotate the graph 90 degrees so you can see the words.  Also you can ditch the lines.  Then what you have is a dotplot, following the principles of Cleveland (1985).  You can lay out a few on one page to see some interactions with demographics.
 
 The real challenge here . . . 
 
. . . is to automate this sort of advice.  Or maybe we just need a really nice dotplot() function and enough examples, and people will start doing it?
 
 P.S. 
 
Often a lineplot is better.  See  here  for a discussion of another Sharad example.</p><p>4 0.80295664 <a title="843-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Cash_in%2C_cash_out_graph.html">502 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Cash in, cash out graph</a></p>

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).
  
I agree that (a) the graph could be improved in small ways–in particular, adding half-year data seems like a great idea–and (b) it’s a wonderful, wonderful graph as is.

<p>Introduction: Julyan Arbel  plots  world record running times vs. distance (on the log-log scale):
 
   
 
The line has a slope of 1.1.  I think it would be clearer to plot speed vs. distance—then you’d get a slope of -0.1, and the numbers would be more directly interpretable.
 
Indeed,  this paper  by Sandra Savaglio and Vincenzo Carbone (referred to in the comments on Julyan’s blog) plots speed vs. time.  Graphing by speed gives more resolution:
 
   
 
The upper-left graph in the grid corresponds to the human running records plotted by Arbel.  It’s funny that Arbel sees only one line whereas Savaglio and Carbone see two—but if you remove the 100m record at one end and the 100km at the other end, you can see two lines in Arbel’s graph as well.  The bottom two graphs show swimming records.   Knut  would probably have something to say about all this.</p><p>6 0.79959005 <a title="843-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-12-30-Bill_Gates%E2%80%99s_favorite_graph_of_the_year.html">2154 andrew gelman stats-2013-12-30-Bill Gates’s favorite graph of the year</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A few years ago I  asked  what happened to Matthew Klam, a talented writer who has a bizarrely professional-looking webpage but didn’t seem to be writing anymore.
 
Good news!  He published  a new story  in the New Yorker!  Confusingly, he wrote it under the name “Justin Taylor,” but I’m not fooled (any more than I was fooled when that posthumous Updike story was published under the name “ Antonya Nelson “).  I’m glad to see that Klam is back in action and look forward to seeing some stories under his own name as well.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90262473 <a title="843-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-07-Non-rant.html">843 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-07-Non-rant</a></p>

I would love to see a better version of  this  [from Steve Hsu] if you have time.
  
My reply:  I actually think the graph is ok.  It’s not perfect but it’s dieplaying a small set of numbers in a reasonably clear and coherent way!
 
Everybody thinks I’m a curmudgeon but I like to mix it up on occasion and say something nice.</p><p>3 0.88682401 <a title="843-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-23-The_scalarization_of_America.html">533 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-23-The scalarization of America</a></p>

You lose information when you go from a vector to a scalar.
  
But what about this trick, which they told me about in high school?  Combine two dimensions into one by interleaving the decimals.  For example, if a=.11111 and b=.22222, then (a,b) = .1212121212.</p><p>4 0.86607343 <a title="843-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-n_%3D_2.html">912 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-n = 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People in Chicago are nice.  The conductor on the train came by and I asked if I could buy a ticket right there.  He said yes, $2.50.  While I was getting the money he asked if the ticket machine at the station had been broken.  I said, I don’t know, I saw the train and ran up the stairs to catch it.  He said, that’s not what you’re supposed to say.  So I said, that’s right, the machine was broken.
 
It’s just like on that radio show where Peter Sagal hems and haws to clue the contestant in that his guess is wrong so he can try again.</p><p>5 0.85345984 <a title="843-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-09-What_joker_put_seven_dog_lice_in_my_Iraqi_fez_box%3F.html">330 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-09-What joker put seven dog lice in my Iraqi fez box?</a></p>

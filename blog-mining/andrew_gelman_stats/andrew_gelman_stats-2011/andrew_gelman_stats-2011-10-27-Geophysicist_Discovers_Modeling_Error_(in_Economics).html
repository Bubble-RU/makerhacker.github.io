<p>Introduction: I studied math and physics at MIT. To be more precise, I started in math as default–ever since I was two years old, I’ve thought of myself as a mathematician, and I always did well in math class, so it seemed like a natural fit.
 
But I was concerned. In high school I’d been in the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad training program, and there I’d met kids who were clearly much much better at math than I was. In retrospect, I don’t think I was as bad as I’d thought at the time: there were 24 kids in the program, and I was probably around #20, if that, but I think a lot of the other kids had more practice working on “math olympiad”-type problems. Maybe I was really something like the tenth-best in the group.
 
Tenth-best or twentieth-best, whatever it was, I reached a crisis of confidence around my sophomore or junior year in college. At MIT, I started right off taking advanced math classes, and somewhere along the way I realized I wasn’t seeing the big picture. I was able to do the homework pr</p><p>4 0.1360175 <a title="976-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-14-Battle_of_the_Americans%3A__Writer_at_the_American_Enterprise_Institute_disparages_the_American_Political_Science_Association.html">274 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-14-Battle of the Americans:  Writer at the American Enterprise Institute disparages the American Political Science Association</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steven Hayward at the American Enterprise Institute wrote  an article , sure to attract the attention of people such as myself, entitled, “The irrelevance of modern political science,” in which he discusses some silly-sounding papers presented at the recent American Political Science Association and then moves to a larger critique of quantitative political science:
  
 
I [Hayward] have often taken a random article from the American Political Science Review, which resembles a mathematical journal on most of its pages, and asked students if they can envision this method providing the mathematical formula that will deliver peace in the Middle East. Even the dullest students usually grasp the point without difficulty.
 

 
At the sister blog, John Sides  discusses and dismisses  Hayward’s arguments, point on that, among other things, political science might very well be useful  even if  it doesn’t deliver peace in the Middle East.  After all, the U.S. Army didn’t deliver peace in the Midd</p><p>5 0.13202992 <a title="976-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-26-Teaching_yourself_mathematics.html">236 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-26-Teaching yourself mathematics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some thoughts  from Mark Palko:
  
Of all the subjects a student is likely to encounter after elementary school, mathematics is by far the easiest to teach yourself. . . . 


What is it that makes math teachers so expendable? . . .


At some point all disciplines require the transition from passive to active and that transition can be challenging. In courses like high school history and science, the emphasis on passively acquiring knowledge (yes, I realize that students write essays in history classes and apply formulas in science classes but that represents a relatively small portion of their time and, more importantly, the work those students do is fundamentally different from the day-to-day work done by historians and scientists). By comparison, junior high students playing in an orchestra, writing short stories or solving math problems are almost entirely focused on processes and those processes are essentially the same as those engaged in by professional musicians, writers and mat</p><p>6 0.10690454 <a title="976-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-24-Bell_Labs.html">970 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-24-Bell Labs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Posted by Phil Price:
 
 A blogger  (can’t find his name anywhere on his blog) points to  an article  in the medical literature in 1994 that is…well, it’s shocking, is what it is.  This is from the abstract:
  
In Tai’s Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method (less than +/- 0.4%). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin
  
Yes, that’s right, this guy has rediscovered the trapezoidal rule.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  quotes  Bentley University economics professor Scott Sumner  writing  on the first anniversary of his blog:
  
Be careful what you wish for.  Last February 2nd I [Sumner] started this blog with very low expectations… I knew I wasn’t a good writer . . . And I was also pretty sure that the content was not of much interest to anyone.


Now my biggest problem is time–I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the blog, seven days a week.  Several hours are spent responding to reader comments and the rest is spent writing long-winded posts and checking other economics blogs. . . .


I [Sumner] don’t think much of the official methodology in macroeconomics.  Many of my fellow economists seem to have a Popperian view of the social sciences.  You develop a model.  You go out and get some data.  And then you try to refute the model with some sort of regression analysis. . . .


My problem with this view is that it doesn’t reflect the way macro and finance actually work.  Instead the models are</p><p>4 0.74482787 <a title="976-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-02-Selection_bias%2C_or%2C_How_you_can_think_the_experts_don%E2%80%99t_check_their_models%2C_if_you_simply_don%E2%80%99t_look_at_what_the_experts_actually_are_doing.html">1295 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-02-Selection bias, or, How you can think the experts don’t check their models, if you simply don’t look at what the experts actually are doing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.
  
In response, Phil  commented :

<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  defines  a Ddulite as follows:
  
A preference for higher tech solutions even in cases where lower tech alternatives have greater and more appropriate functionality; a person of ddulite tendencies.


Though Ddulites are the opposite of Luddites with respect to attitudes toward technology, they occupy more or less the same point with respect to functionality.
  
As a sometime Luddite myself (no cell phone, tv, microwave oven, etc.), I should in fairness point out the logic in favor of being a Ddulite.  Old technology is typically pretty stable; new technology is improving.  It can make sense to switch early (before the new technology actually performs better than the old) to get the benefits of being familiar with the new technology once it does take off.</p><p>2 0.96685344 <a title="976-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-19-%E2%80%9CRonald_Reagan_is_a_Statistician_and_Other_Examples_of_Learning_From_Diverse_Sources_of_Information%E2%80%9D.html">1771 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-19-“Ronald Reagan is a Statistician and Other Examples of Learning From Diverse Sources of Information”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Continuing “heckle the press” month here at the blog, I (Bob) found the following “discovery” a little overplayed by  David H. Freedman , who was writing for  Scientific American  in the following article and blog post:
  
 Blog:  Why Economic Models are Always Wrong 
  Article:  A Formula for Economic Calamity 
   
The article’s paywalled, but the blog entry isn’t.  Apparently, a geophysicist named Jonathan Carter (good luck finding him on the web given only that information) found that when he simulated from a complicated model, then fit the model to the simulated data, he sometimes got different results.  What’s more, these differing estimates fit the data equally well but made different predictions on new data.  Now we don’t know if the model was identifiable, had different local optima (i.e., multiple modes), how he fit the data, or really anything, but it doesn’t really matter.

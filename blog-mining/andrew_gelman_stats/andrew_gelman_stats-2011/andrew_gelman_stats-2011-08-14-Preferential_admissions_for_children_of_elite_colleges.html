When report card grades were released in the fall for the city’s 455 high schools, the highest score went to a small school in a down-and-out section of the Bronx . . . A stunning 94 percent of its seniors graduated, more than 30 points above the citywide average. . . . “When I interviewed for the school,” said Sam Buchbinder, a history teacher, “it was made very clear: this is a school that doesn’t believe in anyone failing.”


That statement was not just an exhortation to excellence. It was school policy.


By order of the principal, codified in the school’s teacher handbook, all teachers should grade their classes in the same way: 30 percent of students should earn a grade in the A range, 40 percent B’s, 25 percent C’s, and no more than 5 percent D’s. As long as they show up, they should not fail.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to an  article  where Ron Unz provides evidence that Jews are way overrepresented at Ivy League colleges, with Asians-Americans and non-Jewish whites correspondingly underrepresented.  Unz attributes this to bias and pressure in the admissions office and recommends that, instead, top colleges should switch to a system based purely academic credentials (he never clearly defines these, but I assume he’s talking about high school grades, SAT scores, and prizes in recognized academic competitions).  He recommends that Harvard, for example, get rid of preferences for athletes, musicians, and rich people, and instead reserve one-fifth of their slots based on pure academic merit and with the remaining four-fifth “being randomly selected from the 30,000 or so American applicants considered able to reasonably perform at the school’s required academic level and thereby benefit from a Harvard education.”

<p>Introduction: Timothy Noah  reports :
  
At the end of 2007, Harvard announced that it would limit tuition to no more than 10 percent of family income for families earning up to $180,000. (It also eliminated all loans, following a trail blazed by Princeton, and stopped including home equity in its calculations of family wealth.) Yale saw and raised to $200,000, and other wealthy colleges weighed in with variations.
  
Noah argues that this is a bad thing because it encourages other colleges to give tuition breaks to families with six-figure incomes, thus sucking up money that could otherwise go to reduce tuition for lower-income students.  For example:
  
Roger Lehecka, a former dean of students at Columbia, and Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies there, wrote in the New York Times that Harvard’s initiative was “good news for students at Harvard or Yale” but “bad news” for everyone else. “The problem,” they explained, “is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale’s</p><p>5 0.11523038 <a title="853-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>6 0.10774449 <a title="853-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-Upper-income_people_still_don%E2%80%99t_realize_they%E2%80%99re_upper-income.html">673 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-Upper-income people still don’t realize they’re upper-income</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.
 
2.  Subtract points for taking the SAT multiple times.  A simple rule would be:  You can use your highest SAT score, but you lose 50 points for every other time</p><p>4 0.72486466 <a title="853-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>5 0.71159148 <a title="853-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-03-Is_Harvard_hurting_poor_kids_by_cutting_tuition_for_the_upper_middle_class%3F.html">598 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-03-Is Harvard hurting poor kids by cutting tuition for the upper middle class?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jenny Anderson  reports  on a discussion of the practice of colleges preferential admission of children of alumni:
  
 
[Richard] Kahlenberg citing research from his book “Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions” made the case that getting into good schools matters — 12 institutions making up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population produced 42 percent of government leaders and 54 percent of corporate leaders.


And being a legacy helps improve an applicant’s chances of getting in, with one study finding that being a primary legacy — the son or daughter of an undergraduate alumnus or alumna — increases one’s chance of admission by 45.1 percent.
 

 
I’d call that 45 percent but I get the basic idea.
 
But then Jeffrey Brenzel of the Yale admissions office replied:
  
“We turn away 80 percent of our legacies, and we feel it every day,” Mr. Brenzel said, adding that he rejected more offspring of the school’s Sterling donors than he accepted this year (</p><p>2 0.90992677 <a title="853-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-19-Weather_visualization_with_WeatherSpark.html">580 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-19-Weather visualization with WeatherSpark</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lyric Semiconductor   posted:
  

For over 60 years, computers have been based on digital computing principles. Data is represented as bits (0s and 1s). Boolean logic gates perform operations on these bits. A processor steps through many of these operations serially in order to perform a function. However, today’s most interesting problems are not at all suited to this approach.


Here at Lyric Semiconductor, we are redesigning information processing circuits from the ground up to natively process probabilities: from the gate circuits to the processor architecture to the programming language.  As a result, many applications that today require a thousand conventional processors will soon run in just one Lyric processor, providing 1,000x efficiencies in cost, power, and size.

  
 Om Malik  has some more information, also relating to the team and the business.
 
The fundamental idea is that computing architectures work deterministically, even though the world is fundamentally stochastic.</p><p>5 0.86450034 <a title="853-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-09-iPython_Notebook.html">1716 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-09-iPython Notebook</a></p>

I wanted to inform you on iPython Notebook technology – allowing markup, Python code to reside in one document. Someone ported  one of your examples from ARM .


iPynb file is actually a live document, can be downloaded and reran locally, hence change of code on document means change of images, results. Graphs (as well as text output) which are generated by the code, are placed inside the document automatically. No more referencing image files seperately. 


For now running notebooks locally require a notebook server, but that part can live “on the cloud” as part of an educational software. Viewers, such as nbviewer.ipython.org, do not even need that much, since all recent results of a notebook are embedded in the notebook itself. 


A lot of people are excited about this; Also out of nowhere, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation dropped a $1.15 million grant on the developers of ipython which provided some extra energy on the project.
  
Cool.

I saw  a post  on Andrew Sullivan’s blog today about life expectancy in different US counties. With a bunch of the worst counties being in Mississippi, I thought that it might be another case of analysts getting extreme values from small counties.


However, the paper (see  here ) includes a pretty interesting methods section. This is from page 5, “Specifically, we used a mixed-effects Poisson regression with time, geospatial, and covariate components. Poisson regression fits count outcome variables, e.g., death counts, and is preferable to a logistic model because the latter is biased when an outcome is rare (occurring in less than 1% of observations).”


They have downloadable data. I believe that the data are predicted values from the model. A web appendix also gives 90% CIs for their estimates.


Do you think they solved the small county problem and that the worst counties really are where their spreadsheet suggests?

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
I’m aware that there  are  some people who use a Bayesian approach largely because it allows them to provide a highly informative prior distribution based subjective judgment, but that is not the appeal of Bayesian methods for a lot of us practitioners. It’s disappointing and surprising, twenty years after my initial experiences, to still hear highly informed professional statisticians who think that what distinguishes Bayesian statistics from Frequentist statistics is “subjectivity” ( as seen in  a recent blog post and its comments ).
 
 My first encounter with Bayesian statistics was just over 20 years ago. I was a postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a new PhD in theoretical atomic physics but working on various problems related to the geographical and statistical distribution of indoor radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be dangerous if present at high concentrations). One of the issues I ran into right at the start was th</p><p>3 0.16924319 <a title="770-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-13-Hey%21__Here%E2%80%99s_a_referee_report_for_you%21.html">144 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-13-Hey!  Here’s a referee report for you!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just wrote this, and I realized it might be useful more generally:
  
The article looks reasonable to me–but I just did a shallow read and didn’t try to judge whether the conclusions are correct.  My main comment is that if they’re doing a Poisson regression, they should really be doing an overdispersed Poisson regression.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen data in my life where the non-overdispersed Poisson is appropriate.  Also, I’d like to see a before-after plot with dots for control cases and open circles for treatment cases and fitted regression lines drawn in.  Whenever there’s a regression I like to see this scatterplot.  The scatterplot isn’t a replacement for the regression, but at the very least it gives me intuition as to the scale of the estimated effect.  Finally, all their numbers should be rounded appropriately. 
  
Feel free to cut-and-paste this into your own referee reports (and to apply these recommendations in your own applied research).</p><p>4 0.1679987 <a title="770-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-22-Evaluating_the_impacts_of_welfare_reform%3F.html">1732 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-22-Evaluating the impacts of welfare reform?</a></p>

I was recently in a conversation with some colleagues regarding the evaluation of recent welfare reform in California. The discussion centered around what types of design might allow us to understand the impact the changes. Experimental designs were out, as random assignment is not feasible. Our data is pre/post, and some of my colleagues believed that the best we can do under these circumstance was a descriptive study; i.e. no causal inference. All of us were concerned with changes in economic and population changes over the pre-to-post period; i.e. over-estimating the effects in an improving economy. 


I was thought a quasi-experimental design was possible using MLM. Briefly, my suggestion was the following:


Match our post-participants to a set of pre-participants on relevant person level factors, and treat the pre/post differences as a random effect at the county level.

After seeing it cited, I just read  your paper  in Technometrics.  The home radon levels provide an interesting and instructive example.


I [Hoaglin] have a different take on the difficulty of interpreting the estimated coefficient of the county-level basement proportion (gamma-sub-2) on page 434.  An important part of the difficulty involves “other things being equal.”  That sounds like the widespread interpretation of a regression coefficient as telling how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor when the other predictors are held constant.  Unfortunately, as a general interpretation, that language is oversimplified; it doesn’t reflect how regression actually works.  The appropriate general interpretation is that the coefficient tells how the dependent variable responds to change in that predictor after allowing for simultaneous change in the other predictors in the data at hand.

Okay, have done due diligence here & can’t find the reference. It was in recent blog — and was more or less an aside — but you ripped into researchers (pretty sure econometricians, but this could be my memory adding to your account recollections it conjured from my own experience) who purport to make estimates or predictions based on multivariate regression in which the value of particular predictor is set at some level while others “held constant” etc., on ground that variance in that particular predictor independent of covariance in other model predictors is unrealistic.  You made it sound, too, as if this were one of the pet peeves in your menagerie — leading me to think you had blasted into it before.


Know what I’m talking about?


Also — isn’t this really just a way of saying that the model is misspecified — at least if the goal is to try to make a valid & unbiased estimate of the impact of that particular predictor?

After reading your paper about scaling regression inputs by two standard deviations I found your  blog post  stating that you wished you had scaled by 1 sd and coded the binary inputs as -1 and 1.  Here is my question:


If you code the binary input as -1 and 1, do you then standardize it?  This makes sense to me because the mean of the standardized input is then zero and the sd is 1, which is what the mean and sd are for all of the other standardized inputs.  I know that if you code the binary input as 0 and 1 it should not be standardized.


Also, I am not interested in the actual units (i.e. mg/ml) of my response variable and I would like to compare a couple of different response variables that are on different scales.  Would it make sense to standardize the response variable also?

I have been slowly working my way through the grad program in stats here, and the latest course was a biostats course on categorical and survival analysis.  I noticed in the semi-parametric  and parametric material (Wang and Lee is the text) that they use stepwise regression a lot.


I learned in econometrics that stepwise is poor practice, as it defaults to the “theory of the regression line”, that is no theory at all, just the variation in the data.


I don’t find the topic on your blog, and wonder if you have addressed the issue.
  
My reply:
 
Stepwise regression is one of these things, like outlier detection and pie charts, which appear to be popular among non-statisticans but are considered by statisticians to be a bit of a joke.  For example, Jennifer and I don’t mention stepwise regression in our book, not even once.

I saw  a post  on Andrew Sullivan’s blog today about life expectancy in different US counties. With a bunch of the worst counties being in Mississippi, I thought that it might be another case of analysts getting extreme values from small counties.


However, the paper (see  here ) includes a pretty interesting methods section. This is from page 5, “Specifically, we used a mixed-effects Poisson regression with time, geospatial, and covariate components. Poisson regression fits count outcome variables, e.g., death counts, and is preferable to a logistic model because the latter is biased when an outcome is rare (occurring in less than 1% of observations).”


They have downloadable data. I believe that the data are predicted values from the model. A web appendix also gives 90% CIs for their estimates.


Do you think they solved the small county problem and that the worst counties really are where their spreadsheet suggests?

<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

<p>Introduction: This article  is a discussion of a  paper  by Greg Francis for a special issue, edited by E. J. Wagenmakers, of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology.  Here’s what I wrote:
  
Much of statistical practice is an effort to reduce or deny variation and uncertainty. The reduction is done through standardization, replication, and other practices of experimental design, with the idea being to isolate and stabilize the quantity being estimated and then average over many cases. Even so, however, uncertainty persists, and statistical hypothesis testing is in many ways an endeavor to deny this, by reporting binary accept/reject decisions.


Classical statistical methods produce binary statements, but there is no reason to assume that the world works that way. Expressions such as Type 1 error, Type 2 error, false positive, and so on, are based on a model in which the world is divided into real and non-real effects. To put it another way, I understand the general scientific distinction of real vs</p><p>4 0.94782877 <a title="770-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-21-Stan_Model_of_the_Week%3A_Hierarchical_Modeling_of_Supernovas.html">2299 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-21-Stan Model of the Week: Hierarchical Modeling of Supernovas</a></p>

Our inaugural post comes from Nathan Sanders, a graduate student finishing up his thesis on astrophysics at Harvard. Nathan writes,
  
“Core-collapse supernovae, the luminous explosions of massive stars, exhibit an expansive and meaningful diversity of behavior in their brightness evolution over time (their “light curves”). Our group discovers and monitors these events using the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii, and we’ve collected a dataset of about 20,000 individual photometric observations of about 80 Type IIP supernovae, the class my work has focused on. While this dataset provides one of the best available tools to infer the explosion properties of these supernovae, due to the nature of extragalactic astronomy (observing from distances 
  1 billion light years), these light curves typicall</p><p>5 0.94526154 <a title="770-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-25-An_interesting_but_flawed_attempt_to_apply_general_forecasting_principles_to_contextualize_attitudes_toward_risks_of_global_warming.html">2112 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-25-An interesting but flawed attempt to apply general forecasting principles to contextualize attitudes toward risks of global warming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

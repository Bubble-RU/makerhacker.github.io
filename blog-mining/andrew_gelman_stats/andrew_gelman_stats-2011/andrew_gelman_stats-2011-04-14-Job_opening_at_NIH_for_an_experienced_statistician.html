<p>Introduction: Richard Morey writes:
  
Rink Hoekstra and I are undertaking some research to explore how people use classical statistical results to evaluate the weight of evidence. Bayesians often critique classical techniques for being difficult to interpret in terms of what scientists want to know, but there is clearly information in the statistics themselves. We wonder how people extract that information. Below is our official announcement; it would be great if you could let people on your blog know about the survey, as we want to get a wide variety of statistical users to take the survey.


Announcement follows:

 
Empirical science is grounded on the belief that data can be used as evidence. The convincingness of data — the “weight” of the evidence they provide — is crucial to deciding between rival scientific positions. In situations with no uncertainty, reasoning about evidence is often straightforward; in practice, however, most conclusions from data involve uncertainty. In these situations,</p><p>3 0.12953226 <a title="660-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-17-NSF_program_%E2%80%9Cto_support_analytic_and_methodological_research_in_support_of_its_surveys%E2%80%9D.html">1217 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-17-NSF program “to support analytic and methodological research in support of its surveys”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg points me to  this  announcement of a program from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics of the National Science Foundation:
  
The Center would like to enhance its efforts to support analytic and methodological research in support of its surveys, and to engage in the education and training of researchers in the use of large-scale nationally representative datasets. NCSES welcomes efforts by the research community to use NCSES data for research on the science and technology enterprise.
  
This sounds like a job for Mister P.  My first thought when David sent this to me was  not  to post it, because maybe I’d want to apply myself!  But then I thought better of my piggy instincts, so here it is.  I think some of the readers of this blog are doing research that would be relevant for this program, so . . . go for it!</p><p>4 0.11531018 <a title="660-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-24-My_talk_midtown_this_Friday_noon_%28and_at_Columbia_Monday_afternoon%29.html">1821 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-24-My talk midtown this Friday noon (and at Columbia Monday afternoon)</a></p>

I’m also giving a shorter talk on the same topic in the Sustainable Development Seminar  Series  4pm Monday 29 Apr in room 407 International Affairs Bldg (at 118th St. and Amsterdam Ave.).

Can you post the announcement below on your blog? And, by all means, if you find heresy in my interview with Ron Wasserstein, feel free to criticize it with your readers.
  
I responded that I’m not religious, so he’ll have to look for someone else if he’s looking for findings of heresy.  I did, however, want to share his announcement:
  
The American Statistical Association has announced  a new Prize , “Causality in Statistics Education”, aimed to encourage the teaching of basic causal inference in introductory statistics courses.  


The motivations for the prize are discussed in  an interview  I [Pearl] gave to Ron Wasserstein. I hope readers of this list will participate, either by innovating new tools for teaching causation or by nominating candidates who deserve the prize.

<p>Introduction: The Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University invite applications for a post-doctoral fellow position in Biostatistics.
 
We are seeking a highly motivated individual to develop novel statistical methods for missing data imputation and applications in health disparities research using national administrative data, with funding from Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality. The candidate will be jointly mentored by Dr. Yan Ma (PI of the grant) at the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS)/Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and Dr. Andrew Gelman in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. 
   
The candidate will also have excellent opportunities to collaborate with researchers in biostatistics, epidemiology, health disparities, and orthopedics through the Clinical and Translational Science Center at WCMC.
 
Candidates should have a doctoral degree in Statistics or Biostatistics with strong background in Bayesian methods.

<p>Introduction: David Ebert sends this along:
  
Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>6 0.65927488 <a title="660-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-21-Workshop_for_Women_in_Machine_Learning.html">1992 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-21-Workshop for Women in Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This assessment  by Tyler Cowen reminded me that, in 1980, I and just about all my friends hated Jimmy Carter.  Most of us much preferred him to Reagan but still hated Carter.  I wouldn’t associate this with any particular ideological feeling—it’s not that we thought he was too liberal, or too conservative.  He just seemed completely ineffectual.  I remember feeling at the time that he had no principles, that he’d do anything to get elected.
 
In retrospect, I think of this as an instance of uniform partisan swing:  the president was unpopular nationally, and attitudes about him were negative, relatively speaking, among just about every group.
 
My other Carter story comes from a conversation I had a couple years ago with an economist who’s about my age, a man who said that one reason he and his family moved from town A to town B in his metropolitan area was that, in town B, they didn’t feel like they were the only Republicans on their block.
 
Anyway, this guy described himself as a “</p><p>3 0.83658433 <a title="660-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-01-I_owe_it_all_to_the_haters.html">834 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-01-I owe it all to the haters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes when I submit an article to a journal it is accepted right away or with minor alterations.  But many of my favorite articles were rejected or had to go through an exhausting series of revisions.  For example,  this  influential article had a very hostile referee and we had to seriously push the journal editor to accept it.   This one  was rejected by one or two journals before finally appearing with discussion.   This paper  was rejected by the American Political Science Review with no chance of revision and we had to publish it in the British Journal of Political Science, which was a bit odd given that the article was 100% about American politics.  And when I submitted  this  instant classic (actually at the invitation of the editor), the referees found it to be trivial, and the editor did me the favor of publishing it but only by officially labeling it as a discussion of another article that appeared in the same issue.  Some of my most influential papers were accepted right</p><p>4 0.83535123 <a title="660-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-08-More_on_those_dudes_who_will_pay_your_professor_%248000_to_assign_a_book_to_your_class%2C_and_related_stories_about_small-time_sleazoids.html">329 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-08-More on those dudes who will pay your professor $8000 to assign a book to your class, and related stories about small-time sleazoids</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After noticing  these remarks  on expensive textbooks and  this comment  on the company that bribes professors to use their books, Preston McAfee pointed me to  this update  (complete with a picture of some guy who keeps threatening to sue him but never gets around to it).
 
The story McAfee tells is sad but also hilarious. Especially the part about “smuck.”  It all looks like one more symptom of the imploding market for books.  Prices for intro stat and econ books go up and up (even mediocre textbooks routinely cost $150), and the publishers put more and more effort into promotion.
 
McAfee adds:
  
I [McAfee] hope a publisher sues me about posting the articles I wrote.  Even a takedown notice would be fun.  I would be pretty happy to start posting about that, especially when some of them are charging $30 per article.


Ted Bergstrom and I used state Freedom of Information acts to extract the journal price deals at state university libraries.  We have about 35 of them so far.

<p>Introduction: See below.  W. D. Burnham is a former professor of mine, T. Ferguson does important work on money and politics, and J. Stiglitz is a colleague at Columbia (whom I’ve never actually met).  Could be interesting.
  
 
Join the Roosevelt Institute on December 2nd, from 8-11am at NYC’s Harvard Club 27 West 44th St. for a panel discussion of the Bipartisan Deficit Commission Report, the future of the U.S. Economy, and the prospects for policy change in the wake of the midterm elections.


The conversation will be framed by the release of three new Roosevelt Institute White Papers: 


Democracy in Peril: The American Turnout Problem and the Path to Plutocracy (Walter Dean Burnham)


A World Upside Down: Deficit Fantasies in the Great Recession (Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson)


Principles and Guidelines For Deficit Reduction (Joseph Stiglitz)
